The next game in the franchise, Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s: Sister Location, was scheduled to release this coming Friday, October 7th, but if developer Scott Cawthon is to be believed, the project has been delayed by a few months.", "According to a post by Cawthon on the Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s: Sister Location Steam page, the game is being delayed because it\u2019s too dark. Cawthon said that some of the plot elements are so disturbing that they are making him feel sick, and so he is thinking about delaying the game so that he can rework it entirely \"into something kid-friendly.\"", "Delays happen in the gaming industry all the time, but it\u2019s rare for a game to be delayed mere days before its release. Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s fans are confused and angry about this latest development, as many were looking forward to playing the game on Friday. Something else upsetting fans is Cawthon\u2019s reasoning that the game is too dark to release, as being dark and disturbing are two characteristics that many consumers look for in a horror game.", "Cawthon\u2019s reason for suddenly delaying Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s Sister Location from its planned October 7th release date doesn\u2019t make much sense. A more likely scenario is that this is just a weird publicity stunt meant to hype the game as being so disturbing that its developer almost didn\u2019t even release it. Alternatively, perhaps Cawthon is delaying the game for technical reasons and decided to concoct this story instead of admitting that the fifth core game in the series has issues.", "Fans should also consider the possibility that Cawthon is just trolling in an attempt to throw them off the scent of an early release. Cawthon has a habit of surprising fans by releasing Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s games early, and it wouldn\u2019t be all that shocking for Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s: Sister Location to carry on that tradition, despite Cawthon\u2019s post to the contrary.", "With October 7th just a few days away, fans will learn soon enough whether or not Cawthon is serious about Sister Location\u2018s delay. If the game is delayed, it will be interesting to see if Cawthon actually does rework it to be more \"kid-friendly,\" or if he goes with a slightly altered version of his original vision.", "Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s: Sister Location is scheduled to launch on October 7th for PC as well as iOS and Android mobile devices.", "Source: Scott Cawthon"], "targetTitle": "Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s Sequel Delayed for Weird Reason", "targetDescription": "Five Nights at Freddy's creator Scott Cawthon takes to Steam to tease a possible delay for Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location, the fifth game in the series.", "targetKeywords": null, "targetMedia": ["https://gamerant.com/wp-content/uploads/five-nights-at-freddys-sister-location-puppets.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-UeXruRVtZz7w6.gif", "https://gamerant.com/wp-content/themes/9.0/images/logo-3.png", "https://gamerant.com/wp-content/uploads/five-nights-at-freddys-sister-location-puppets-700x389.jpg", "https://gamerant.com/wp-content/uploads/Five-Nights-at-Freddys-Cover-Art.jpg", "https://gamerant.com/wp-content/uploads/five-nights-at-freddys-sister-location-clown-animatronic-700x389.png", "https://gamerant.com/wp-content/themes/9.0/images/logo-4.jpg"], "targetUrl": "https://gamerant.com/five-nights-at-freddys-sequel-delay/?utm_content=inf_124_3412_2&utm_source=Facebook&utm_medium=Partner&utm_campaign=SocialEdge&tse_id=INF_e34a10a08b0811e6b6db4d0235f40af5", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "They think It's too dark. #StopClickBait", "spoilerPublisher": "Stop Clickbait - Gaming"}, "spoiler": ["some of the plot elements are so disturbing that they are making him feel sick"], "spoilerPositions": [[[2, 158], [2, 236]]], "tags": ["passage"], "predicted_labels": 0}

Rowling\u2018s Harry Potter saga, and watching the films, we know a lot about one of our favorite professors and Head of Gryffindor house, Professor Minerva McGonagall. Stern but fair, McGonagall expected a lot from her students, but she also cared for them deeply, even if she didn\u2019t always outwardly express it. However, what if there was something about Professor McGonagall that we never thought about before? Reddit user Obversa made a stunning revelation about one of the most bad-ass witches in the entire HP saga.", "Obversa suggests that \"Professor McGonagall was originally hired by Dumbledore to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts (DADA) in 1956. However, not long after, Tom Riddle (Lord Voldemort) came back to Hogwarts, seeking the DADA position for himself. Dumbledore denied Voldemort\u2019s application and as a result, Voldemort cast a jinx to prevent any DADA professor from \u2018lasting more than a year\u2019. Dumbledore then transferred McGonagall to the Transfiguration position before the term\u2019s end, to prevent anything \"bad\" or \"dangerous\" from happening to her. After all, as long as she wasn\u2019t teaching DADA , the jinx technically wouldn\u2019t apply to her.\" Obversa says, \"Prior to being Headmaster, Dumbledore served as Transfiguration professor for several decades, teaching Tom Riddle himself as a child. He was also McGonagall\u2019s predecessor, under Headmaster Armando Dippet. Thus, when Dumbledore succeeded Dippet, he would have left a vacancy for the spot of Transfiguration.\" We know that Minerva McGonagall filled this vacancy, but what led her there?", "As a result of Pottermore, we know a bit more about Professor McGonagall\u2019s backstory (which is extremely similar to Lord Voldermort\u2019s background). McGonagall was appointed as Dumbledore\u2019s assistant in 1956, not as his replacement. But why would Dumbledore hire a brilliant McGonagall just as his assistant and not to a full teaching position when she first arrived back at Hogwarts? If you recall, one of the reasons why Headmaster Dippet rejected Tom Riddle\u2019s application for the DADA teaching position, at age 17-18 for Tom, was because Tom was \"too young\". However, Dippet encouraged Tom \"to come back a few to several years later to apply again\". At the time, McGonagall was still perhaps too young, to be a Hogwarts professor in her own right.", "Additionally, in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix McGonagall told Dolores Umbridge that she had been teaching at Hogwarts for \"Thirty-nine years this December\". Order of the Phoenix takes place in 1995 and 1996, with this statement coming in approximately September 1995. Therefore, McGonagall\u2019s official hiring would have been in the middle of the school year, very odd timing. But, why would McGonagall who is obviously gifted in Transfiguration initially apply to be the Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor?", "Take note of Professor McGonagall\u2019s wand. It\u2019s made of Fir with a core of Dragon Heartstring. The Wandmaker Ollivander once called it the, \u2018the survivor\u2019s wand,\u2019 because he had sold it to three wizards who subsequently passed through mortal peril unscathed. This means that if the wand chooses the wizard, McGonagall would have been destined for a lot more than Transfiguration.", "It seems likely then that McGonagall started teaching as Dumbledore\u2019s assistant in December of 1956, and, at some point, applied for (and received) the DADA job. However, Lord Voldemort arrived to Hogwarts shortly thereafter wanting to snag the position for himself. Once Dumbledore refused, Voldy put a hex on the position, so McGonagall had to be transferred to Transfiguration. After all, the Dark Lord was probably, \"angry, vindictive, and jealous of McGonagall, and wanted to take his revenge for what he saw as \"what was rightfully his\". He was also obsessed with the similarities between the amazingly gifted witch. Just as he was continually obsessed with the similarities between Harry Potter and himself throughout the entire saga."], "targetTitle": "You Won\u2019t Believe This Stunning \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 Revelation About Professor McGonagall", "targetDescription": "This stunning revelation about Professor McGonagall changes everything we thought we knew about the Harry Potter saga!", "targetKeywords": null, "targetMedia": ["http://www.media4.hw-static.com/media/2016/05/maggie-smith-harry-potter-warner-bros-052516-638x425.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-ef1y0A8erBLUc.gif", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3002265&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "targetUrl": "http://www.hollywood.com/movies/you-wont-believe-this-stunning-harry-potter-revelation-about-professor-mcgonagall-60584784/", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "She was hired to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts, but after Tom Riddle cursed the position, Dumbledore moved her to Transfiguration to protect her.", "spoilerPublisher": "savedyouaclick"}, "spoiler": ["McGonagall was appointed as Dumbledore\u2019s assistant in 1956, not as his replacement."], "spoilerPositions": [[[2, 147], [2, 230]]], "tags": ["passage"], "predicted_labels": 0}

All the scenes are actually in the movie.\"", "Those of you who have been following updates and stories about \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" for a while will note that this dispels a rumor that has been going around for the last few months. Back in September it was rumored that the latest saga film would actually be teasing the first \"Star Wars\" story, \"Rogue One.\" This made a degree of sense, given that the Gareth Edwards-directed feature has been filming since this past summer, and will surely have a good amount of footage ready by the time \"Force Awakens\" arrives in theaters. Now it sounds like that post-credits scene definitely isn\u2019t happening \u2013 so instead maybe we can just expect the blockbuster to come with a trailer for the eighth live-action \"Star Wars\" movie during the coming attractions.", "Post-credits scenes are definitely fun for fans, and a good incentive to get people to stick around and watch the credits \u2013 but I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m too upset that \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" won\u2019t have one. After all, they aren\u2019t exactly part of the franchise\u2019s tradition (none of the previous movies have stingers), and it\u2019s not a device that has to be used all over Hollywood. If everything the movie has to say can be fit between the opening scrawl and the end credits, more power to it.", "Surely there will be some fans who will be disappointed by this news, but hopefully they\u2019ll all get over it fairly quickly. After all, the feelings about the lack of a post-credits scene should be drowned out by the excitement that comes with the fact that we\u2019re now less than two weeks away from the theatrical release of \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\" As always, stay tuned for more about the movie, including our on-camera interviews with the cast and J.J.

But what was in the insecticide, and how does it work?", "The main ingredient of the insecticide, Dibrom, is the chemical naled. It works by killing mosquitoes on contact. Sprayers produce very fine droplets that are small enough to stay airborne and intercept mosquitoes in flight.", "Naled does not pose a health risk to either people or pets when sprayed in low concentrations, according to both the Environmental Protection Agency (PDF) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "However, in its own review of naled, the European Union came to a different conclusion. Naled degrades to dichlorvos , a toxic chemical, in the presence of sunlight, and according to the EU scientific commission , this can cause genetic mutations. As a result, the EU has banned agricultural use of products containing naled.", "In Puerto Rico, where a public health emergency has been declared due to the sheer number of cases of Zika, recommendations from the CDC and the EPA to use aerial spraying to control the mosquito population there have been stymied by protests. Activists organized a June 28 demonstration outside the San Juan CDC and raised concerns about the consequences for human health and their environment.", "By contrast, in Miami-Dade County, the Department of Solid Waste Management's Mosquito Control Section commonly sprays in response to state Department of Health investigations -- and when residents request the use of insecticide.", "The Mosquito Control Section has applied naled via an ultra-low-volume spray for many years, officials said in a news release. In fact, Dibrom has been used in the United States over the past 50 years, said Timothy J. Donnelly, vice president, chief administrative officer and general counsel of AMVAC Chemical Corp ., which makes the insecticide.", "\"It is regularly sprayed in 12 states on over 15 million acres each year,\" Donnelly said.", "Since the variety of mosquito that carries Zika is most active predawn and at sunset, all spraying must take place at those times. Special precautions are not necessary, Miami-Dade County officials advised, though people with allergies may want to remain indoors. During any insecticide operation, it is recommended that beekeepers cover their bees.", "Aerial spraying, which lasts about an hour, was recommended by the CDC and Florida's Department of Health to reduce the population of adult mosquitoes, some of which may be capable of spreading viruses, including Zika. Originally scheduled for Wednesday, the aerial spraying operation was delayed because of poor weather conditions.", "\"When Naled gets sprayed, it knocks out the mosquitoes, but if sprayed over water, it breaks down quickly,\" said Bryn Phillips, a specialist in the University of California, Davis environmental toxicology department.", "His research indicates that the insecticide breaks down into different chemical versions of Naled. One of these versions, dichlorvos, is quite toxic to aquatic species at the \"low end of the food chain,\" like aquatic insects and frog larvae -- \"basically fish food,\" Phillips said.", "If the chemicals are rotated and managed properly, an environmental area can recover, Phillips noted.", "Naled spray droplets stay airborne for an extended period, and the chemical begins to break down once exposed to sunlight or water. Very little of the low-concentration spray settles on the ground. Those who worry that they may have come into contact with the chemicals should wash, county officials advised; any food that may have been exposed should be rinsed before eating. Since concentrations are far below what is harmful to humans, symptoms, such as skin irritation or headache, are unlikely.", "Miami-Dade County's aerial spraying alternates between naled and an insecticide called BTI (bacillus thuringiensis israelensis, a naturally occurring bacterium), which targets mosquito larvae instead of adult mosquitoes. BTI has been registered with the EPA since 1961 as a pesticide.", "Zika was discovered in 1947 in Uganda. An outbreak that began in Brazil in 2015 has spread throughout the Americas. Florida reported the nation's first local transmission of Zika from an infected mosquito in late July.", "Zika has been shown to be responsible for an alarming increase in microcephaly, in which babies are born with small brains and heads, as well as other hearing, vision and developmental disorders.", "Although spraying insecticides raises concerns about toxicity to aquatic life, policy-makers must weigh the potential costs to human health by not spraying and costs to environmental health by spraying, Phillips said.", "Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.", "\"You talk to the mosquito spraying guys, and they're all about human health, and they're OK with some impacts to the environment,\" he said.

Well maybe now we\u2019ve sparked your curiosity.", "They don\u2019t fart\u2014detectably. There\u2019s no reason to believe that birds are somehow exempt from passing gas, but it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone has ever truly observed\u2014or more importantly, measured\u2014a bird fart. But between ornithologists, veterinarians, and amateur bird watchers, how is it possible no one has ever seen the feathered creatures flatulate?", "As Monterey Bay Aquarium veterinarian Mike Murray said in a 2009 article for Popular Science, birds are capable of passing gas, but they don\u2019t because they lack the same combination of diet and gas-forming bacteria in their gut that gives mammals their odorous gas. Murray added that if he spotted gas in an x-ray of a bird\u2019s gastrointestinal tract, he\u2019d be concerned something was wrong with the bird.", "But Laura Eriksen, a birder, educator, and blogger at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, has a different theory. In a blog post on her website, she posits that birds have much shorter digestive tracts than mammals, so there\u2019s less time for gas to build up, allowing farts to slip by undetected.", "In another blog post, she describes the only written account she\u2019s aware of describing a possible bird fart. It comes from former Cornell student Alan Richard Weisbrod, in his 1965 master\u2019s thesis on blue jays.", "One of the birds in front of me defecated. A small puff of whitish gas was expelled along with the feces. The feces dropped from the bird while the gas wafted below and parallel to the slightly raised tail, until it dissipated rapidly into the cold air. The gas could be clearly seen against the dark-colored eave that hangs over the sheltered perches, upon which the birds were fluffed and resting. Several days later a bird perched in the same position was observed to defecate with the accompanying wisp of whitish gas.", "Weisbrod goes on to describe how birds eat similar diets to many mammals who definitely flatulate but explains that he could not find any other accounts of bird flatulence at that time. (And apparently no scientist has stepped up to the plate to follow up on Weisbrod\u2019s observation.) He also acknowledges that the \"wisp of whitish gas\" could also have simply been water vapor\u2014steam rising from the feces. (Just think of how your dog\u2019s poop steams in the cold when you take him out for his daily business in the winter.)", "It\u2019s a little difficult to know for sure that birds rarely or never fart. According to Mental_Floss, human farts are smelly due to a combination of our diets and the microbes in our guts that help digest the foods in our diets. A video by AsapSCIENCE adds that \"the longer the food stays in the gut, the more time it has to ferment\" and break down into its smellier components\u2014namely sulfur. So if birds don\u2019t have the right food-microbe combo and intestinal length to produce smelly gas, then we wouldn\u2019t smell it.", "Without a smell, bird farts rustle no one\u2019s feathers.", "But even if birds produced immaculate, odorless gas, would we hear it? That is less clear. According to a Q&A with proctologist Lester Gottesman in VICE, farts make a sound due to the composition of gas and the shape (read: tightness) of the sphincter. A lot of the gas that makes up a fart, Gottesman said, is swallowed air. And a lot of swallowed air leads to a lot of gas, which can make a bigger, beefier noise. But how much air does a swallow swallow when a swallow swallows air?", "As far as we could tell, this isn\u2019t a question any scientist has specifically tried to measure. But the Daily Dot reached out to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology for answers nonetheless. According to an ornithologist there, relayed via email by the lab\u2019s good-humored press officer Miyoko Chu, birds definitely swallow air. But he thinks they expel it via burping rather than farting. He added that he thinks birds do fart \"in some cases and would depend on what species, their diet, and whether it is observable.\" He also said that he\u2019s never personally noticed a bird fart.", "Lastly, maybe they do swallow enough air that would leave most animals saying \"excuse me\" after a butt-bellow, but perhaps something about the construction of the, erm, exit point keeps it from making a sound. This is pure speculation, but maybe something about having feathers around the bird\u2019s cloaca (its all-purpose back-end chute) helps the fart slip by unnoticed.

Though he does note that if you take too much of the supplement, you may feel drowsy, get a headache , or experience some short-term memory loss. \"Those are the common but pretty mild side effects,\" he says.

If you're still struggling to reach dreamland, Kothare has several other suggestions: Try to maintain a similar sleep schedule during the week and on weekends, limit the use of electronics that emit blue light for 1 to 2 hours before bedtime, and purchase a bright light source for use in the mornings to help regulate your body's internal clock.

His New York Knicks had gotten out of Staples Center with a win over the Los Angeles Lakers and he'd gone an entire game without having to wave to nostalgic Lakers fans on the big screen.", "\"I think the Lakers are trying to move away from that kind of stuff,\" Jackson said as we spoke briefly outside the Knicks' locker room on Dec. 11.", "There was such a distance in the way he said, \"The Lakers.\" This, after all, is the man who won five NBA titles in Los Angeles and was still engaged to Lakers president Jeanie Buss. But that distance was real, and it had kept growing as the years went by and Jackson spent more and more time in New York, running the Knicks, and in Montana with his children and grandchildren during the offseason.", "His connection with Los Angeles, and his fiance\u0301e, was simply too hard to maintain. On Tuesday night, Buss and Jackson announced that they were mutually ending their four-year engagement.", "The announcement -- via their personal Twitter accounts -- brought an end to the NBA's version of Camelot.", "Like the Camelot in Richard Burton's Broadway musical, this had always been an impossible romance.", "The owner's daughter dating the team's coach? And not just any owner: only one of the most powerful owners of all time, Lakers owner Dr. Jerry Buss. And not just any coach: only the most successful NBA coach of all time.", "Then there were hurdles, such as Jeanie Buss being the team's vice president in charge of business affairs at the time, and her brother Jim Buss being in charge of basketball operations.", "So many tangled webs, and yet Jeanie Buss and Jackson somehow made it work for 17 years.", "During the best of times, when the Lakers were winning NBA championships, they'd ride to the arena together from their house in Marina Del Rey. At games, Jeanie would sit with her girlfriends Linda Rambis and Stacy Kennedy in the second row, across the court from the Lakers bench, where Phil could see her and the players could hear her.", "Once on the drive in, Jackson mentioned Lamar Odom needed a little extra encouragement as he adjusted to his new role as a sixth man. So during the game, Buss and her girlfriends made a point of cheering for Odom as he checked into the game. \"Take your pants off!\" they yelled out, as Odom shed his warm-ups near the scorers' table. He beamed at the attention.", "It was a small thing, but it was those kind of gestures that made the impossible relationship work for so many years. The way they'd work in tandem and share thoughts about the team with each other. That was Camelot.", "Once Jackson retired as coach in 2011, things started changing. At first he was home all the time, plotting his next moves. He had no intention of coaching again -- his body couldn't take it. And his spirit was leading him in other directions, toward a front-office career, which would allow him to test his principles from on high, way above the court.", "But when Dr. Buss was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2012, and the franchise needed a coach of some stature to come in and lead the team of superstars -- Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Dwight Howard and Steve Nash -- for what appeared to be Dr. Buss' last ride, Jackson raised his hand.", "As always, he would do it for Jeanie.", "This time, the Lakers didn't call on him. Or rather, general manager Mitch Kupchak called him around midnight to tell him the Lakers had chosen to hire Mike D'Antoni instead.", "Jackson was livid. His agents issued a blistering statement, decrying the disrespect shown to the coach who had won five titles for L.A. and was willing to come out of retirement to coach the team and help his fiancee's family at a critical juncture.", "It did not break apart their relationship though. If anything, it strengthened it. About six weeks later, Jackson proposed to Jeanie Buss. His knees and hips were too stiff to get down on one knee. Not that he is the grand gesture type, anyway. What was important is that he knew getting engaged would make her happy, and give her father some peace as he lay dying.", "The engagement was almost destined to stay at that level once Jackson became president of the Knicks in 2014. Jackson and Buss had to sign documents that ensured there would be no conflicts of interest between the two franchises. According to sources, that included a provision that the NBA and its owners be informed if they ever decided to marry.", "So now not only were they living apart, they couldn't talk about their jobs when they were together. If they ever did decide to marry, it would further complicate their business relationships.", "As the years went by, Jackson focused in on the Knicks and Buss focused on the Lakers. He would come to Los Angeles when he could, and she would see him in New York when she attended board of governors meetings, but friends say it got harder and harder to find time to connect.", "Both of their legacies are tied to what they do next. Buss must decide whether to reboot the Lakers' front office. Jackson needs to make the Knicks into a contender. Those close to Jackson say he intends to stay for the full five years of his contract with the Knicks, despite the mutual option that's built into his contract this summer.", "There had been speculation that Jackson could return to the Lakers this offseason, when they might need a new guide in the front office, and he could amicably part from New York. Those are the types of implausible things that happen in Camelot.", "It was never meant to be.", "Buss has been spending the past year supervising the development of the team's new practice facility, and working tirelessly on the league's new collective bargaining agreement. She also has maintained close ties with first-year coach Luke Walton, which is a departure from her distant relationships with previous Lakers coaches. Those close to Buss say she also has been giving more thought to the looming question of the team's front office.", "All of those are massive things, that Jackson and Buss simply couldn't talk about given their current roles.", "So the impossible relationship officially came to a loving end Tuesday night.

Her reputation in tatters, it was widely believed that her image and reputation had become too toxic to ever again hold a high position at News Corp.", "That speculation appears to have underestimated Murdoch's affinity for Brooks.

Among the allegations was evidence that the voicemail of a murdered schoolgirl had been illegally accessed, which gave her family false hope that she was still alive.", "The inquiries dragged on for years, with Brooks eventually found not guilty of all charges.", "Brooks avoided jail time, but the damage had been done. The former editor had become the face of the out-of-contol excesses of London's tabloid media.", "Peter Jukes, a journalist who closely followed the hacking trial, noted that Brooks' reputation has not recovered despite her acquittal on all charges.", "\"I can say that having toured around the UK talking about the trial ... the overwhelming question isn't, 'Why was Rebekah put on trial,' but 'Why was she found not guilty?'\" Jukes said.", "But it was Brooks' bond with Murdoch that served her even after ending up as the type of tabloid fodder that she had once fed on. As the chairman and CEO of News Corp, Murdoch has been one of the most powerful global media figures for decades. His affinity for her had been the source of no shortage of reporting in the UK, with some saying that she was like a daughter to him.", "An odd fit", "Even if some people believed that Brooks would eventually return to a role at News Corp, few expected her to land at Storyful.

Why? Well, if everybody\u2019s busy campaigning and raising money, there\u2019s no time for governing.\"", "The little support Jolly has gained for the idea comes largely from Florida, home to three of his eight co-sponsors, including Democrat Alan Grayson, also a Senate candidate. A Democratic congressional candidate in Florida, businessman Randy Perkins, went one step further, announcing he would stop \"soliciting or accepting\" financial contributions.", "But Jolly, a former lobbyist and longtime staffer to the late congressman C.W.

What\u2019s more, then and there, despite having no experience of rearing animals, he vowed to nurse the poor baby back to health.", "This took place in 2013 on the sizzling streets of Tampa. Longo, a Florida native, thought that the little thing didn\u2019t look good, and he knew that the unrelenting sunshine was taking its toll.", "Indeed, Longo later recounted how the helpless baby was \"half-dead\" when they first met. And so, despite having no clue even as to what the animal was, he decided to take it back to his home in St. Petersburg.", "Consequently, Longo christened the critter Biscuits and began to hand-rear her himself. Clearly, then, the first order of the day was to give the adorable and tiny creature, which was just over an inch in length, some major TLC.", "However, without an inkling of even which species Biscuits belonged to, Longo didn\u2019t have the first idea about how best to raise her. So, this being the 21st century and all, he began to research his new-found friend online.", "First, Longo went to Reddit to ask the website\u2019s online community for help. However, most of the responses were from people telling him, simply, that there was no way he\u2019d manage to raise Biscuits on his own. Undeterred, though, Longo continued his research and eventually discovered the answer he was looking for.", "It turned out that he was going to be looking after a southern flying squirrel. Naturally, this species of squirrel usually resides in forests and woods, using trees as their habitat. They furthermore survive on a diet of nuts, seeds, fruit and insects as well as eggs and birds.", "The gliding rodents are nocturnal, and young squirrels tend to stay with their mothers until they are at least two months old. Since Biscuits had somehow become separated from her family, then, it was now down to Longo to fill her mother\u2019s shoes.", "So, for two months, Longo took Biscuits everywhere with him \u2013 even to work.

Almost across the board, practice should improve one\u2019s performance.\"", "But it also means that for the same amount of practice, some will end up being better at sports than others. \"Essentially, learning rates vary,\" Macnamara says. \"Some people improve very quickly with less practice, while others require much more practice.\"", "The analysis found this 18 percent figure is roughly true no matter what type of sport is being played. Practice accounts for the same difference in performance in bowling as it does field hockey, two completely different activities.", "Practice also explains fewer differences in ability the further an athlete ascends into higher levels of play. Which suggests \"deliberate practice loses its predictive power beyond a certain level of skill,\" the study reports. The analysis also found that the age when athletes started their sports didn't change this figure much either.", "So what, then, explains the remaining 82 percent?", "Here's where we should note a limitation of studying practice: Researchers typically ask athletes to recall their schedules and practice hours, and memories can be faulty.", "But Macnamara doesn't think better measurements of practice would make that 18 percent figure leap up to near 100.", "\"There\u2019s probably not one huge contributor that\u2019s accounting for everything else,\" she says.", "Instead, there's likely a whole constellation of factors \u2014 some of which are genetic or biological in nature \u2014 that explain why some people are better athletes than others. They include:", "Personality and perseverance", "Propensity to get injured", "Propensity to choke under pressure", "Individual differences in maximum oxygen uptake", "Differences in how we acquire muscle mass", "Coordination", "Height", "Enjoyment of competition", "\"We have so many factors within a person that can contribute to [athletic performance] \u2014 different genes, different cognitive abilities, different physical attributes,\" she says. \"All of those things are important and interact with each other. Which is why it is so hard to pin down what predicts performance.\"", "Overall, she says the finding is a strike against the popular \"10,000 hour rule,\" which implies anyone can become master at an activity if they were to just devote the time to it. The research in sports, and in other activities such as music, games, and education, just doesn't back that hypothesis up.", "On the other hand, it's not like these findings are an excuse not to try.", "\"Eighteen percent is big,\" Macnamara says. \"We're trying to argue against these ideas that it's so important it accounts for nearly everything.\" Practice matters, but it's unlikely to bridge the gap between inborn superstars and your average, or perhaps clumsy, kid.", "For the athletically un-inclined, like myself, it's a bit of a relief. It's okay if you can't make up the difference with practice, or if you're just a \"slow learner\" when it comes to sports. It's also okay to just enjoy being on a team, trying hard but knowing you'll unlikely be the best.", "Growing up, my dad was on a quest to find \"my sport\" \u2014 the activity I'd finally master. Lacrosse was the closest we came. But it was mostly a parade of failures. Baseball: Throw a ball at me and I'll be more likely to bruise than catch it. Soccer: I was much too slow. Basketball: All of the above. Tennis: I was cut from the middle school team.", "I'm not a well-coordinated person, and that's just fine.", "These days I stick to activities that don't involve hand-eye coordination: hiking, biking, running, skiing.

Does it rely on evidence?", "There haven\u2019t been many studies that investigate the science behind astrology, but of the few that have, the results have failed to support the validity of astrological views. For instance, a study tested the accuracy of astrological charts in describing the personality traits of 193 study participants, and the results indicated that the scores were at a level consistent with chance.", "So far, it can\u2019t be said that astrology relies on replicable scientific evidence \u2014 and replicability is a must for an idea to prove itself as valid.", "3. Does it attempt to explain the natural world?", "Yes, astrology\u2019s basic premise is that the sun, moon, planets, and constellations have an effect on humans and earthly events. Further, it uses a set of rules about the relative positions and movements of the stars and planets to predict and explain worldly events and human personality.", "However, as Understanding Science explains, \"Although astrologers seek to explain the natural world, they don't usually attempt to critically evaluate whether those explanations are valid \u2014 and this is a key part of science.\"", "Plus, astrology doesn\u2019t lead to ongoing research, which is another key part of science.", "So, unfortunately for everyone who swears their daily horoscope is always on point or blames their stubbornness on being a Scorpio or a Taurus, it appears that there\u2019s not much scientific evidence to back those claims.

She also knew that it had started in villages in the north around the turn of the century, and then moved south over the decades.", "Lindenbaum had a hunch about what was going on, and she turned out to be right. It had to do with funerals. Specifically, it had to do with eating dead bodies at funerals.", "In many villages, when a person died, they would be cooked and consumed. It was an act of love and grief.", "As one medical researcher As one medical researcher described , \"If the body was buried it was eaten by worms; if it was placed on a platform it was eaten by maggots; the Fore believed it was much better that the body was eaten by people who loved the deceased than by worms and insects.\"", "Women removed the brain, Women removed the brain, mixed it with ferns, and cooked it in tubes of bamboo. They fire-roasted and ate everything except the gall bladder. It was primarily adult women who did so, says Lindenbaum, because their bodies were thought to be capable of housing and taming the dangerous spirit that would accompany a dead body.", "\"So, the women took on the role of consuming the dead body and giving it a safe place inside their own body \u2014 taming it, for a period of time, during this dangerous period of mortuary ceremonies,\" says Lindenbaum.", "But women would occasionally pass pieces of the feast to children. \"Snacks,\" says Lindenbaum. \"They ate what their mothers gave them,\" she says, until the boys hit a certain age and went off to live with the men. \"Then, they were told not to touch that stuff.\"", "Finally, after urging from researchers like Lindenbaum, biologists came around to the idea that the strange disease stemmed from eating dead people.

The group, which won a Nobel Prize for the findings, dubbed it a \"slow virus.\"", "But it wasn't a virus \u2014 or a bacterium, fungus, or parasite. It was an entirely new infectious agent, one that had no genetic material, could survive being boiled, and wasn't even alive.", "As As another group would find years later, it was just a twisted protein, capable of performing the microscopic equivalent of a Jedi mind trick, compelling normal proteins on the surface of nerve cells in the brain to contort just like them. The so-called \"prions,\" or \"proteinaceous infectious particles,\" would eventually misfold enough proteins to kill pockets of nerve cells in the brain, leaving the cerebellum riddled with holes, like a sponge.", "The process was so odd that The process was so odd that some compared it to Dr. Jekyll's transformation to Mr. Hyde: \"the same entity but in two manifestations \u2014 a 'kind', innocuous one and a 'vicious', lethal one.\"", "The epidemic likely started when one person in a Fore village developed sporadic \u2014 the difference is that others rarely come into contact with infected human tissue.

Dr. Ermias Belay, a prion disease researcher with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, says that's the only scenario in which there is \"definitive evidence\" that humans can develop a prion disease after eating the infected meat of another species.", "But, he says, there are still a lot of open questions about how and why humans get prion diseases.", "For one, it's still a mystery why animals, including humans, have those proteins in the first place \u2014 the Jekylls that can be so easily turned into Hydes. One leading hypothesis, Nature , is that they play an important role in the protective coating around nerves.

One leading hypothesis, described recently in the journalNature, is that they play an important role in the protective coating around nerves.", "But here's the bigger question, says Belay: \"How many of these diseases actually jump species and affect humans?\"", "Kuru showed that people could get a prion disease from eating infected people. Mad cow disease showed that people can get a prion disease from eating infected cow. But what about other prion diseases in other animals? Could, say, hunters get sick from eating infected deer? That's what researchers in North America, including Belay, are trying to find out right now.", "\" Chronic wasting disease in North America is spreading fast,\" says Belay. The disease causes infected wild deer and elk to starve to death. \"In early 2000, we had about three states that reported CWD in the wild in deer and elk. Today , that number is 21.\"", "Belay says the disease is \"a little bit concerning\" because, unlike mad cow disease and kuru, where infectious prions were concentrated in the brain and nervous system tissue, in an animal with chronic wasting disease, the misfolded prions show up all over the body. They can even be found in saliva, feces and urine, which could explain how the disease is spreading so quickly among wild deer and elk.", "The CDC is working with public health authorities in Wyoming and Colorado to monitor hunters for signs of prion disease.", "\"Unfortunately, because these diseases have long incubation periods, it's not easy to monitor transmission,\" says Belay. He says he and his colleagues have yet to find any evidence that hunters have picked up chronic wasting disease from the meat of infected wild animals.", "\"And that, in itself, is good news for us,\" he says.", "But, as with kuru, it will take years \u2014 maybe even decades \u2014 before he can know for sure."], "targetTitle": "When People Ate People, A Strange Disease Emerged : The Salt : NPR", "targetDescription": "For decades, a rare disease crawled across Papua New Guinea.

The majority of people no longer assume that southpaws are tools of Satan, alight with hellfire. Today\u2019s lefties are surrounded by a far more benevolent glow. We associate left-handedness with intelligence, out-of-the-box thinking, and artistic talent. But are these flattering generalizations backed up by science? Does being left-handed really make you more creative?", "The answer to that is a definitive ... maybe.", "Scientists have been chipping away at the peculiarities of left-handedness, which occurs in about 10 percent of the population, for a long time. They\u2019ve looked into the purported links between left-handedness and things like mental illness, faulty immune systems, and criminal behavior. They\u2019ve studied whether lefties are better at problem-solving, and if they\u2019re more likely to die young. From all these studies on left-handedness, we can conclude one thing, and one thing alone: science is complicated.", "A handful of studies have found a link between left-handedness and creativity, conferred, some think, by the fact that left-handed folks constantly have to adjust to a right-handed world. Other studies found no link at all.", "Some researchers conclude that lefties are no smarter than righties, while others say that left-handedness comes with a clear intellectual advantage. Is there really a left-handed personality? Are lefties more prone to schizophrenia and learning disabilities? That depends on who you ask.", "But \"Are lefties different?\" might not even be the right question. Over the last few years, a number of studies have concluded that it\u2019s not which hand is dominant that matters\u2014it\u2019s the degree of dominance. According to researchers, very few people are truly entirely left- or right-handed; it\u2019s more of a spectrum. We use our left hands for some things and our right hands for other tasks.", "These experiments have found that people toward the middle of the spectrum are more flexible thinkers. They seem to be more empathetic and better able to view things from other people\u2019s perspectives. When considering the risks and benefits of any given decision, inconsistent-handed people (as researchers call them) are more likely to focus on the risks, whereas people at the outer edges of the handedness spectrum pay more attention to potential benefits. They may even sleep differently. It seems we\u2019ve been aiming our stereotypes a little too far to the left.", "But who knows? This is ever-changing, constantly evolving science.

So what can they tell you about yourself? Here's a taste...", "By Jena Pincott", "\"You're Taking The Wrong Chill Pill\"", "Try this to preempt stress-triggered pig-outs: two 1/4-cup servings daily of yogurt that is (preferably) unsweetened and (crucially) probiotic-enriched (look for B. animalis, S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus). After a month of this regime, volunteers in an fMRI study at UCLA's School of Medicine showed brain activity that's associated with greater emotional stability (a stronger connection between pain-processing circuits and the prefrontal cortex), compared with the non-probiotic control group. One explanation: The good bacteria in yogurt send out signals that increase serotonin, the neurotransmitter that famously reduces anxiety. While most probiotic eaters don't have big mood changes, says lead author Kirsten Tillisch, MD, many (anecdotally) say they feel calmer over time. Ongoing research focuses on the subtle, cumulative, long-term effects of microbes as anxiety reducers.", "\"Your Housemates Influence You More Than You Think\"", "OK, you don't like yogurt. Or kimchi, tempeh, sauerkraut or other \"friendly-flora\" foods. But if your housemates eat them -- good news! Their healthy brain-boosting microbes have probably taken up residence in you. \"A number of gut microbes form so-called spores -- environmentally hyper-resistant cells that help to colonize them,\" explains James Scott, professor of occupational & environmental health at the University of Toronto. They're found on surfaces and in dust; we inhale and ingest them.", "\"You Found Wisdom Among The Dahlias\"", "A bacterium in soil called M. vaccae may be a cognitive enhancer, found a study published in Behavioural Processes. After mice ate a peanut-butter-flavored dose of the bug, they navigated mazes twice as fast as those not treated. Turns out, M. vaccae are among the gut bacteria that trigger a rise in serotonin -- which not only calms us but also boosts memory and concentration. (For mice, the \"superbrain\" effect lasted for at least a week after the last exposure.) We inhale and ingest this microbe when we're around dirt and plants; to what extent might it help us navigate life's mazes? Stay tuned.", "\"You're Hungry... Very, Very Hungry\"", "Surprisingly, gut bacteria may also control appetite, nudging you toward the oozy, creamy, crunchy foods they like. Fact is, the little buggers have species-specific appetites (a microbiologist can tell what types of food you eat and predict whether you're slender or not just from the variety of microbes in your stool sample). \"Bad guy\" bacteria may be partly to blame for your junk-food cravings -- by, for instance, sending out sugar-and-fat-jonesing signals via the gut-to-brain vagus nerve. Plus, some microbes may help you extract more calories from food and increase fat storage -- effectively making you put on weight.", "\"You Struggle To Burn Off Your Muffin Top\"", "While the blame for a big belly doesn't lie entirely with its wee inhabitants, the wrong microbes can contribute to it and make it harder to lose. In a study led by Liping Zhao at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, a 385-pound patient had unusually high counts of a fat-loving bug called Enterobacter in his gut. Zhao transferred the bacterium to his lab mice -- and here's the shocker -- they became fat and diabetic (control animals on the same high-fat diet did not), suggesting that Enterobacter helped cause obesity. As it turns out, the bug triggers chronic low-grade inflammation, which leads to insulin resistance and weight gain. The patient lost 113 pounds in 23 weeks on a diet of whole grains and \"prebiotics\" -- nondigestible high-fiber foods (examples include garlic, onions, chicory root, dandelion greens and asparagus) that feed friendly bacteria, like the Bifidobacterium in your yogurt, and starve the bad. (Within weeks, the Enterobacter was completely wiped out.)", "\"You Really Love A Smooth Grenache\"", "Good news here if you think dandelion greens are more compelling when paired with a strong drink. A study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that red wine's polyphenols -- those compounds whose heart-healthy benefits you've heard so much about -- also have prebiotic potential. Just one glass (9 ounces) of red wine daily for a month meaningfully boosted drinkers' ratios of good-to-bad gut bacteria (compared with alcohol-free and polyphenol-free gin-drinking controls). A caveat: The benefit doesn't apply to sweet dessert wines, which presumably feed the wrong microbiota.", "\"Sorry, You Have A High-Steak Problem\"", "Now consider pairing that grenache with something other than short ribs. The problem here is that certain red-meat-loving gut bacteria increase your heart attack risk, found a study at the Cleveland Clinic. When microbes digest compounds in meat called carnitine and lecithin, the liver uses the byproduct to make an artery-hardener that may be even more of a culprit in heart disease than cholesterol: trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). Note: Only if you have bacteria in your gut that are accustomed to meat -- vegans don't -- could you churn out TMAO.

Trump\u2019s hesitance to condemn David Duke, his \"law and order\" mantra evocative of Richard Nixon\u2019s Southern strategy, and his conspiracy theories about the president\u2019s birth certificate are all intended to whip up white racial resentment.", "Which brings us to the crux of the matter: Whether the subject is poverty, police brutality or affirmative action, conservatives are loath to acknowledge the presence of racism in American society.

Still, it would be remiss of us not to point out how big the Chilis\u2019 crowd is tonight: it feels twice as large as Biffy\u2019s or Disclosure\u2019s.The frontman doesn\u2019t say much tonight - Flea, as usual, does most of the talking - but when he does open his mouth, it\u2019s to share this nugget of wisdom with us: \"All these firefighters and they don't know how to put out a flare/ Shit, it's hard to breathe, might set fire to your pubic hair/ I might have to do a WWE into that table full of drinks down there.\" Um, thanks for that, Anthony.", "The Red Hot Chili Peppers\u2019 drummer is a 54 year-old man who\u2019s never worn a baseball cap the right way round, and he remains this band\u2019s resident badass.

This focus might be helping Trump, since Solomon\u2019s recent research shows that people who are thinking about death are more likely to say they support him.

He and his colleagues have tried to supply that proof through experimentation.", "Their research is still preliminary and controversial, and they haven\u2019t worked out a complete theory, but they have discovered a number of startling facts about how people think about death.", "For example, Solomon and Florette Cohen of the City University of New York, College of Staten Island recently found evidence that asking people to think about immigrants also gets them thinking about death.", "Solomon and Cohen asked a small group of volunteers at the College of Staten Island to respond to one of three prompts. One group was asked to write down what they thought would happen, in as much detail as possible, if immigrants moved into their neighborhoods, and what emotions they would feel. The other two groups were asked to answer the same questions, but about their own deaths and about feeling intense pain instead of about immigration.", "Then the two researchers gave the participants a set of words with letters missing and asked them to fill in the blanks to get an idea of what the participants were thinking about.

If they were thinking about death, however, they might write \"COFFIN\" instead.", "The participants who had been asked to think about immigration had death on their minds, too \u2014 almost to the same extent as those who had been asked to think about death explicitly.", "Assigned scores from zero to one based on how many words related to death they produced, those who had been asked to think about immigration scored 0.92 on average, while those who had been asked to think about death scored 0.96. Those asked to think about pain scored just 0.19. There was no evidence that the effect was greater for conservative participants in the study.", "Solomon said he hopes to replicate the study, which was completed with a small group of a few dozen students at the College of Staten Island.", "Yet the results accord with those of similar studies that suggest people interpret challenges to their culture as threats to their very existence.

The average rating for those who had been reminded of their mortality was 3.8 points, but it was just 2.2 points for those who had been asked to think about pain.", "Solomon said these results suggest that the fear of death is one of several interrelated psychological concepts that could help explain why Trump has been so successful, including authoritarianism, an aversion to uncertainty and racial prejudice.", "\"It sure seems like an existentially shaky historical moment where it has become increasingly difficult for the average American to perceive that they have any basis for either meaning or self-worth,\" Solomon said. \"It is a factor, and in a very close election, it could matter.\""], "targetTitle": "This might be the darkest theory yet about why Donald Trump keeps winning", "targetDescription": "You probably shouldn't read this one at night or even on a cloudy day.", "targetKeywords": "Donald Trump", "targetMedia": ["http://archive.is/UcUZx/9fbc2e1bb9a9c371853b3e2a1c608d7736f38b58", "data:text/html;base64,PGh0bWw+PGJvZHkgc3R5bGU9ImJhY2tncm91bmQtY29sb3I6dHJhbnNwYXJlbnQiPgo8L2JvZHk+PC9odG1sPg==", "http://archive.is/UcUZx/13497349ee0b5b15125e10f90ce1f7b165238c9a/scr.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAQAICRAEAOw==", "http://archive.is/UcUZx/592be39991eec021b7cf91a7087e0c118f6a8e2e.jpg", "http://archive.is/UcUZx/c6f1d1f10ebbcc646e6807b1a0c4063772dea23a.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAID/AMDAwAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAQAICRAEAOw==", "http://archive.is/UcUZx/387f8855cf3a9442a822c19ffc6a1e34c09c365d.jpg", "http://archive.is/UcUZx/d235c8fa3a39bd7d3466c44a81d7b154be0943c3.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAMDAwAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==", "http://archive.is/UcUZx/e78dbb232f28d838c7e833010d10cb892772b1a9", "http://archive.is/UcUZx/e4ff19a1790d65c68e194032086900456f789c44", "http://archive.is/UcUZx/9a4b438bb716e5b2a8306fc854c30e258c30bef5.jpg", "http://archive.is/UcUZx/3c8a12565c71dc51016dc66db83afc95503850d1.png", "http://archive.is/UcUZx/7769df736d49a561a5915bffdd1da65e0b52ff66.jpg", "http://archive.is/UcUZx/cdb2afdcdc3360c8ce6e61d89e8fd21b10951cf3.jpg", "http://archive.is/UcUZx/e28c70086c6e268991245832c81b238138c67a93", "http://archive.is/UcUZx/ecee40515d44bc80496fe1673dad14a22bad1bc3.jpg", "http://archive.is/UcUZx/6027f5f720ba0813139960c131e16c731203c95a", "http://archive.is/UcUZx/25222a2af2c7e7942b8f15bf80a7e869db4151c6.png", "http://archive.is/UcUZx/e65878919224fd5f785077b6cd4ea21cfb4d2eb0", "data:image/png;base64,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", "http://archive.is/UcUZx/a7d9fce6823bf6309a439fdfbe9f1be36b03a177", "http://archive.is/UcUZx/6a0fe6ed7d5408f4c443501b44efbc87b2b0ae81.png", "http://archive.is/UcUZx/2a3a8cc6e582a2013b115cf6e60a0a89c604fed6", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex/6gNJowqlzHFZ/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==", "http://archive.is/UcUZx/e549036defeebb11710575fe4feba9f4cd01e2b0", "http://archive.is/UcUZx/7b5e21c86687a98cda78ea68ade14712f28eb3ba.jpg", "http://archive.is/UcUZx/8e8b4dc5e9ef1fac46825106c81176a9ad375780", "http://archive.is/UcUZx/ae65e30e2464197c8f49a736f2dac672e4a7a53e", "http://archive.is/UcUZx/c1ef04e9785032ba0ad8315b009f78b8a3587e60.jpg"], "targetUrl": "http://archive.is/UcUZx", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "People who think about death are more likely to support him", "spoilerPublisher": "savedyouaclick"}, "spoiler": ["Solomon\u2019s recent research shows that people who are thinking about death are more likely to say they support him"], "spoilerPositions": [[[2, 143], [2, 255]]], "tags": ["passage"], "predicted_labels": 0}

These collisions from the moon-forming impact would have generated superheated material, the researchers said.", "\"In an explosion, there is often collateral damage, where nearby buildings and innocent bystanders are affected,\" Bottke said. \"Investigators can learn about the explosive device and the explosion itself by studying what happened to people, infrastructure, and whether trace amounts of the explosive device can be found among the blast damage. Here, the 'innocent bystanders' were the main-belt asteroids.\"", "Collisions against these asteroids in more recent times returned these remnants to Earth in stony meteorites, which the scientists now have analyzed and used to date the age of the impact.", "\"In a sense, the asteroid belt has been an eyewitness to multiple 'drive-by shootings' from the earliest time in solar system history,\" Bottke said. \"By reading the traces left behind, we can use asteroid samples to tell us who did it, when they did it and how they did it.\"", "The researchers deduced that the moon-forming impact occurred about 4.47 billion years ago, in agreement with many previous estimates.", "\"We can now use asteroids, for the first time, to tell us about many of the major events that took place in the inner solar system during the planet-formation era,\" Bottke said. \"This gives us a new window on a time period which has been virtually unknown up to now.\"", "This research \"raises the intriguing possibility that trace amounts of the primordial Earth or moon-forming impactor called Theia may still be found on asteroids today, or possibly within some of our meteorites,\" Bottke said. \"It may be simply a matter of looking and asking the right questions. Finding these materials would be one of the Holy Grails of geology \u2014 we have no rocks older than 4 billion years old on Earth, and no one knows the exact nature of the original building blocks of our planet.\"", "If future research can uncover examples of this impact in asteroid samples, \"possibly by getting them from an asteroid sample return mission like OSIRIS-REx, we would have one of the key pieces of the puzzle explaining why our world is the way it is, and what has changed since its infancy,\" Bottke said.", "The scientists detailed their findings in the April 17 issue of the journal Science."], "targetTitle": "We've finally figured out when the moon formed", "targetDescription": "It involves a duck.

For one, Apple's top-line phone, the iPhone 5S, can't be preordered. If you want it the first day it's on sale, you have to wait in line -- creating yet another organic marketing tool for Apple. The company's top-line phone, with the new features like the fingerprint reader and desktop-like performance, should be the one with higher sales. As many others have pointed out, the iPhone 5C is essentially a rebranded iPhone 5 with nearly all the same specs. John Gruber, a well-regarded Apple observer, thinks it's a clever marketing move for Apple's second-tier phone:", "It\u2019s just that instead of putting the year-old iPhone 5 in slot #2, they\u2019ve created the 5C to debut in that slot. The 5C is, effectively, an iPhone 5. Same A6, same camera, same just about everything \u2014 except for the most obvious difference, its array of colorful plastic shells ... What changes with the 5C is that the middle tier is suddenly more appealing, and has a brand of its own that Apple can promote apart from the flagship 5S.", "With Android-run smartphones made by Samsung and Google cutting into Apple's market share, many see the global appetite for Apple smartphones waning. But preorder numbers for iPhone 5C, even if they are low, may not be the best indication.", "For now, Apple will keep plugging away at the 5C.

These repositories are nice to collect our coins in one place, but more often than not, pennies tend to dominate the bulk of the volume.

It actually costs more for the United States to produce a new penny than a penny is worth, meaning they are literal black holes of value. However, just because they may be as good as obsolete in a monetary sense, there are still a lot of things that pennies can be used for with the help of a little creativity. That\u2019s exactly what one mom did with her spare pennies.", "Knowing her daughter\u2019s love for dancing and playing, she decided to take some of her old pennies and glue them to the bottom of her daughter\u2019s play shoes, and the results were amazing.

Long-term exposure to arsenic, even at low levels, has been linked to increased risks of bladder, lung and skin cancer, as well as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

However, 52 participants had tap water arsenic levels higher than the EPA's limits.", "The arsenic levels in participants' toenails were 0.12 micrograms per gram, on average. However, it is unclear what level of concentration found in toenail samples might signal an unsafe level of arsenic exposure, said study author Kathryn Cottingham, researcher at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.", "The toenail measurements in the study served only as a way to compare levels among people, the researchers said.", "People who reported drinking on average two and half beers or a glass of white wine every day had arsenic levels 20 to 30 percent higher than those of people who didn't drink.", "The study wasn't designed to find why higher consumption of beer and wine was linked to higher arsenic levels, but a few scenarios are possible, Cottingham said.

It is also possible that arsenic is added during the filtration process that gives beer and wine their sparkly, clear looks, as one recent study suggested, Cottingham said.", "And lastly, alcohol itself may be to blame for the higher arsenic levels, by impairing the body's ability to detoxify arsenic.", "\"The mechanisms that our bodies use to try to get rid of the stuff that is not good for us can be impaired by alcohol consumption,\" Cottingham said.", "The researchers didn't find a link between arsenic levels and intake of rice, which is thought to be relatively high in arsenic. But in line with previous studies, they found that the more dark-meat fish people ate, the higher were their arsenic levels.", "People who ate dark-meat fish once a week had about a 7 percent higher arsenic concentration in their toenails compared with people who consumed these fish less than once a month.", "Although some foods are high in arsenic, people don't need to avoid them entirely, Cottingham said. \"Probably the best way to avoid exposure from diet is to mix it up in the foods, and not eat the same thing every day.\"", "It's also important to keep water sources safe, she said. \"If someone is drinking water from a private well, they should get it tested.

As John Adams himself wrote to his wife upon his becoming the second president in 1797, the transfer of power was \"the sublimest Thing ever exhibited in America.\"", "But while Adams was the first to experience that transition, it wasn't until four years later that the principle was put to the test.", "After all, George Washington didn't want to run again for the 1796 election and Adams kept power within the same party. In 1800, on the other hand , the United States saw its first hotly contested election and its first transfer of power between political parties. The result was close, and it also left Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr tied, with the House spending a week deciding who would be President. (At the time, the Vice President was whoever came in second.) It was easily conceivable that the entire system would fall apart, but instead Jefferson became President and his rivals\u2014the incumbent Adams as well as Burr\u2014accepted the result. As Jefferson would later write , the \"revolution of 1800\" was a big deal:", "[It was] as real a revolution in the principles of our government as that of 1776 was in its form; not effected indeed by the sword, as that, but by the rational and peaceable instrument of reform, the suffrage of the people. The nation declared its will by dismissing functionaries of one principle, and electing those of another, in the two branches, executive and legislative, submitted to their election.", "This principle\u2014that the nation declares its will by voting, and the functionaries of government peacefully accept the choice\u2014has even been upheld when perhaps the candidate might have wished to do otherwise.", "For example, some believe that the 1960 presidential election was subject to substantial enough voting irregularities that Richard Nixon should have won. (In fact, there is no concrete evidence either way .) But, even though it was an extremely close race and some of his supporters urged him to fight the result, Nixon decided that, in keeping with tradition, it was better to accept the fact that early returns indicated John F Kennedy had won. In a late-night speech to supporters, he explained why:", "As all of you in this room know, and as all of you millions who are listening on television and radio realize, it is normally the custom for a candidate for the Presidency...not to appear until after the decision is definitely known, and all the votes are counted beyond doubt. However, I have been keeping some pretty late hours recently as some of you have...I know too that many who are listening in the Eastern part of the United States will find that it is now about 3:15 in the morning... I want to say that one of the great features of America is that we have political contests, that they are very hard fought, as this one was hard fought, and once the decision is made, we unite behind the man who is elected... I want Senator Kennedy to know, and I want all of you to know, that certainly if this trend continues, and if he does become our next President, he will have my whole-hearted support.", "That tradition even held true in 2000. As TIME's David Von Drehle has pointed out , that year's concession from Al Gore to George W. Bush was a long time in coming not because Gore refused to accept the results of the vote, but because there was no result to accept yet. In fact, when it became clear what the result would be, Gore followed the precedent of hundreds of years' worth of elections, as he peacefully accepted the outcome of the vote. As he explained in his concession speech, that was what patriotism required:", "Almost a century and a half ago, Senator Stephen Douglas told Abraham Lincoln, who had just defeated him for the presidency, ''Partisan feeling must yield to patriotism. I'm with you, Mr. President, and God bless you.'' Well, in that same spirit, I say to President-elect Bush that what remains of partisan rancor must now be put aside, and may God bless his stewardship of this country. Neither he nor I anticipated this long and difficult road. Certainly neither of us wanted it to happen. Yet it came, and now it has ended, resolved, as it must be resolved, through the honored institutions of our democracy.", "That doesn't mean the tradition has always been honored by everyone. In 1860, after Abraham Lincoln was elected, Stephen Douglas (the runner-up for the popular vote) had cause to utter those words later quoted by Gore, as he conceded the result. But, even before the election took place, the South had already warned the nation that a victory by Lincoln and the Republican Party would be unacceptable in their eyes.", "South Carolina seceded from the Union that December, declaring that the North was \"united in the election of a man to the high office of President of the United States whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery.\" Rather than accept the electoral result, the state convention announced that \"public opinion at the North has invested a great political error\" and that South Carolina would not go along with the outcome.

Albuquerque is celebrating the one year anniversary of the city\u2019s successful \"There\u2019s a Better Way\" program.

Anything Helps.\"", "Throughout his administration, as part of a push to connect the homeless population to services, Berry had taken to driving through the city to talk to panhandlers about their lives. His city\u2019s poorest residents told him they didn\u2019t want to be on the streets begging for money, but they didn\u2019t know where else to go.", "Seeing that sign gave Berry an idea. Instead of asking them, many of whom feel dispirited, to go out looking for work, the city could bring the work to them.", "Next month will be the first anniversary of Albuquerque\u2019s There\u2019s a Better Way program, which hires panhandlers for day jobs beautifying the city. In partnership with a local nonprofit that serves the homeless population, a van is dispatched around the city to pick up panhandlers who are interested in working. The job pays $9 an hour, which is above minimum wage, and provides a lunch. At the end of the shift, the participants are offered overnight shelter as needed.", "In less than a year since its start, the program has given out 932 jobs clearing 69,601 pounds of litter and weeds from 196 city blocks. And more than 100 people have been connected to permanent employment.", "\"You can just see the spiral they\u2019ve been on to end up on the corner. Sometimes it takes a little catalyst in their lives to stop the downward spiral, to let them catch their breath, and it\u2019s remarkable,\" Berry said in an interview. \"They\u2019ve had the dignity of work for a day; someone believed in them today.\"", "Panhandlers are hired to beautify the city.

A Berry\u2019s effort is a shift from the movement across the country to criminalize panhandling. A recent National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty report found a noticeable increase, with 24 percent of cities banning it altogether and 76 percent banning it in particular areas.", "There is a persisting stigma that people begging for money are either drug addicts or too lazy to work and are looking for an easy handout.", "But that\u2019s not necessarily the reality. Panhandling is not especially lucrative, but for some people it can seem as if it\u2019s the only option. When they\u2019ve been approached in Albuquerque with the offer of work, most have been eager for the opportunity to earn money, Berry said. They just needed a lift. One man told him no one had said a kind word to him in 25 years.", "Kellie Tillerson, director of Employment Services at St. Martin\u2019s Hospitality Center, the organization that facilitates the city\u2019s program, said the way to dispel people of the negative associations with panhandlers is for them to do what the mayor did and engage on a human level.

They don\u2019t have a Social Security card. Those little things we take for granted prohibit people from getting a job. Don\u2019t assume they are lazy.\"", "The There\u2019s a Better Way van employs about 10 workers a day but could easily take more. When the van fills, people have begged to get a spot next time, she said. That\u2019s why the city has increased funding for the program to expand it from two to four days a week. And it inspired St. Martin\u2019s to start its own day labor program, connecting the jobless to employers in the area who could offer side jobs.", "Tillerson said a lot of the people who get picked up by the van were not aware of all the services available to them. One man who recently got out of prison returned to St. Martin\u2019s the day after taking one of the city\u2019s jobs. She said it enrolled him in the day-labor program, told him about behavioral health services and are helping him get an ID.", "\"He now has a support system he didn\u2019t know he needed and definitely didn\u2019t know existed,\" she said. \"It\u2019s life-changing for them. He was one that said, \u2018I would much rather earn my money than have someone hand it to me.\u2019 \"", "Dozens of cities around the country have reached out to Berry wanting to copy the program. It\u2019s a testament, he said, to the work mayors do regardless of political party.", "He was the first Republican mayor elected in Albuquerque in 30 years, and he\u2019s proactively tackling homelessness.", "The program hasn\u2019t weeded out all panhandling in the city, and supporters say that\u2019s not really the point.

Guess who\u2019s winning?"], "postPlatform": "reddit", "targetParagraphs": ["Tim Connor stands by a sign his neighbor purchased to thwart commuters from cutting through their quiet residential street in Takoma Park, Md. (Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post)", "When the traffic on Timothy Connor\u2019s quiet Maryland street suddenly jumped by several hundred cars an hour, he knew who was partly to blame: the disembodied female voice he could hear through the occasional open window saying, \"Continue on Elm Avenue . . . .\"", "The marked detour around a months-long road repair was several blocks away. But plenty of drivers were finding a shortcut past Connor\u2019s Takoma Park house, slaloming around dog walkers and curbside basketball hoops, thanks to Waze and other navigation apps.", "\"I could see them looking down at their phones,\" said Connor, a water engineer at a federal agency. \"We had traffic jams, people were honking. It was pretty harrowing.\"", "And so Connor borrowed a tactic he read about from the car wars of Southern California and other traffic-weary regions: He became a Waze impostor. Every rush hour, he went on the Google-owned social-media app and posted false reports of a wreck, speed trap or other blockage on his street, hoping to deflect some of the flow.", "He continued his guerrilla counterattack for two weeks before the app booted him off, apparently detecting a saboteur in its ranks. That made Connor a casualty in the social-media skirmishes erupting across the country as neighborhoods try to contend with suddenly savvy drivers finding their way on routes that were once all but secret.", "Waze is a navigation app that uses user-collected data to calculate the quickest and safest routes to user's destinations. Here's what you need to know about the app. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post)", "[A warning left on a nanny\u2019s car. License plates stolen. And a Pentagon official in big trouble]", "\"It used to be that only locals knew all the cut-through routes, but Google Maps and Waze are letting everyone know,\" said Bates Mattison, a city councilman in the Atlanta suburb of Brookhaven, Ga. \"In some extreme cases, we have to address it to preserve the sanctity of a residential neighborhood.\"", "When population growth began to overwhelm a set of major intersections in his district, there was an increase of 45,000 cars a day on some residential streets, as app-armed commuters fought their way to nearby Interstate 85. In response, the city is posting signs to restrict left or right turns at key intersections.", "The apps didn\u2019t create the traffic, Mattison said, but they gave drivers options they wouldn\u2019t have known about otherwise.", "Waze, with 50 million users worldwide, provides navigation guidance by combining its map database with data it collects in real time from every logged-on driver. Average speed, backups and fleeting hazards such as a car pulled over to change a flat appear almost instantly on the app\u2019s cartoonish interface. When the first Waze-enabled car finds its way to a promising shortcut, thousands can follow.", "In Portland, Ore., for example, when drivers trying to avoid local construction began flooding a street that had been redesigned as a \"greenway\" bike route, city officials had to put up barrels on some stretches to filter out the vehicular through-traffic. It worked.", "\"The apps reacted pretty quickly to that,\" said Jonathan Maus, publisher of Bikeportland.org.", "In California, where navigation apps are as common to drivers as sunglasses, several communities are contending with overwhelmed local streets that residents blame at least in part on the programs. In the Los Angeles region, Waze\u2019s biggest U.S. market, a City Council person representing Sherman Oaks is considering a motion asking the programs to exclude some small residential streets from their algorithms.", "It was here that Connor learned that some Waze warriors had launched concerted campaigns to fool the app. Neighbors filed false reports of blockages, sometimes with multiple users reporting the same issue to boost their credibility. But Waze was way ahead of them.", "[A Marine fights to prove he\u2019s innocent of sexual misconduct. Then a lost cellphone is found.]", "It\u2019s not possible to fool the system for long, according to Waze officials. For one thing, the system knows if you\u2019re not actually in motion. More important, it constantly self-corrects, based on data from other drivers.", "\"The nature of crowdsourcing is that if you put in a fake accident, the next 10 people are going to report that it\u2019s not there,\" said Julie Mossler, Waze\u2019s head of communications. The company will suspend users they suspect of \"tampering with the map,\" she said.", "Waze\u2019s mission is to distribute traffic more efficiently across the grid of public streets, Mossler said, not to create traffic jams.", "\"That said, the traffic has to go somewhere,\" she said. Although the app will continue to route drivers down any legal street, Waze programmers are working to build in alerts about school zones and other slow-speed zones, Mossler said.", "Traffic engineers say the side street flare-ups are a downside to the otherwise positive effect that navigation apps can have on vehicle flow.", "They have proved to be a powerful force in moving cars past bottlenecks, and in many jurisdictions, including Maryland and the District, officials have begun working directly with Waze to glean information about potholes, backups and other real-time data.", "The cut-through disputes \"are an unintended consequence of this great technology that is supposed to help people avoid sitting in traffic,\" said Paul Silberman, a traffic engineer with Sabra, Wang & Associates in Columbia, Md.", "Those who live on side streets have been complaining for years about becoming through routes, but now it\u2019s happening at Internet speed.", "\"These great shortcuts used to spread by word of mouth, but now they just spread like wildfire,\" Silberman said.", "[Three workers once died rebuilding this bridge. Now a new makeover is under way.]", "In Takoma Park, Connor complained to the city\u2019s public works and police departments, but nothing stemmed the flow. He put out two plastic watch-for-children figures, but one was hit by a car and the other was stolen.", "Connor and his neighbors put up \"No Through Traffic\" signs. And their city councilman, Tim Male, tried to get Google Maps to take note of the official detour, by calling the company and flagging it through the apps\u2019 feedback feature.", "But still they came. One afternoon, Connor counted a vehicle every two seconds on a street with a single lane available between parked cars.

Sparkling water is the umbrella term for carbonated water, including naturally carbonated sparkling mineral water and artificially carbonated seltzer and club soda.

But a study published earlier this year in the Journal of the American Dental Association found that the pH of plain sparkling water, about 5, is not low enough to erode enamel.", "Carbonation does not in itself lead to dental erosion, said Dr. John Ruby, an adjunct professor of pediatric dentistry at The University of Alabama at Birmingham, who co-authored the paper. \"It\u2019s when they add citric acid or phosphoric acid that\u2019s in your classic soft drinks that the pH can drop below the critical pH of 4, where you then can have dental erosion as an outcome.

But you can get flavor in a less acidic form by adding a slice of lemon or lime (or other fruits, vegetables or herbs, such as cucumber, mint or basil) to plain sparkling water.", "According to a spokesman from the American Dental Association, the greatest potential health drawback of consuming bottled sparkling water is missing out on the benefit of fluoride when you drink it instead of fluoridated tap water. In-home sparkling water makers, such as SodaStream, have gained popularity in recent years because they save money and have environmental benefits, but an additional advantage of making your own sparkling water from the tap may be the fluoride, which the ADA emphasizes is essential for maintaining long-term oral health.", "An additional health note: Club soda, which contains added sodium to mimic the taste of mineral water, is not the same as seltzer.

Even though I make $100,000 a month, I'll still wear my favorite shirt even if it has a hole in it, she says.", "But the biggest reason for her success may be her internal drive.", "I've always been super competitive, she says. I would always win at a board game or jump rope the most, little things like that, and people would often joke, Michelle's going to be president one day, or Michelle's going to be a millionaire one day, because I was always so competitive, determined, and independent. Her friends and family also thought she would be successful because she always helped others with their problems.", "Growing up, I was always super determined, so I don't think anyone was surprised with how successful my blog was, she says. It was always expected of me   that I'd do something pretty out of the norm.", "Here's how she paid off her debt and grew her income so quickly.", "How did you pay off your student loans so quickly?", "Six months before I graduated, I received a letter stating how much I would owe every month when I graduated. It was going to be $500 a month or so. I don't remember the number, but it was a number I felt was way too high for my income. I decided I didn't want it hanging over my head for the rest of my life, so I figured I would try to pay it off as quickly as I could so I didn't have to worry about it 10 years from now. I figured a little bit of pain now would be worthwhile later.", "So in addition to being a financial analyst, I also did a bunch of side jobs. Altogether, I was working 100 hours a week. My side jobs consisted of taking surveys, mystery shopping, doing staff writing, doing research phone calls for companies and other things.", "As soon as I earned any extra money, I put it toward my student loan debt so it wouldn't be sitting in my bank account and I wouldn't be thinking of other ways to spend it.", "What were your expenses during this time?", "My boyfriend at the time (now my husband) and I had bought a house when we were 20, and our mortgage was less than $1,000, but I had other regular expenses like transportation, groceries, etc. We also had combined our finances, so it helped that we shared our bills.", "When did the blog start coming into the picture?", "I had actually started my blog in August 2011, before I graduated with my finance MBA. I got the idea one day when I was reading Cosmo and they had an article featuring the personal finance site Daily Worth. I started reading that website and I became super-interested in personal finance blogs.", "I started my blog as a hobby. I didn't start it thinking I'd make an income from it. Six months later, I made my first $100 from my blog when a blogger friend who was already profiting from her blog connected me with an advertiser. I didn't even know blogs could make money.", "Until then, my blog had genuinely just been fun for me. But once I realized I could make money, it boosted my motivation. I sought out deals and wanted to see if companies wanted to sponsor my blog. Also, companies would approach me. When my blog had been just a hobby, they would approach me, but I would ignore all those emails. Once I realized I could make money from my blog, I took them more seriously and gave them my rates. At that time, I charged $100 for a sponsored post on my blog or $150 for an advertisement on my sidebar.  I also made a little bit on Google Adsense and affiliate income, where I was promoting other companies' products, and if one of my readers bought through me, the company would pay me.", "My advertisers were mainly financial companies like coupon websites and cell phone apps and other services that helped people save money. At that time, it wasn't so much banks, but I do have bank advertisers now and I charge them much more than that of course.", "I also started looking for opportunities writing for other bloggers and immersing myself into the blogging community.", "How much did you earn from the blog to begin with?", "In the beginning, in May of 2012, I earned $500. And by December 2012, I was up to $5,700 that month. The month I paid off my student loans, July of 2013, I earned $11,000 that month.", "How exactly does the blog bring in money?", "Now, I'm making money in much different ways from just a few years ago. Before I was making money from sponsored posts and by writing for other blogs, and now the majority is through affiliate marketing   $50,000 a month is from that, and that's the bulk of my income. There are 15-20 companies I actively promote on my social media and blog platform.", "The other big revenue stream is my affiliate marketing course, in which I teach other bloggers how to create affiliate income. In November 2016, that accounted for $38,000 of my income. I created that because I had so many bloggers email me asking them to teach them how to increase their affiliate marketing earnings. Now it's more a form of passive income, since I already created the source and people just purchase it and all the instructions and lessons are already done.", "My third biggest source of income from my blog is advertising. In those instances, maybe I partner with a bank and they ask me to advertise a certain service or product that they are currently selling. Or I participate in a Twitter chat with the company, or they do some kind of advertisement on my social media platforms.", "Why did your income roughly triple from 2015 to 2016?", "In 2015, I decided to stop doing all my freelancing. I stopped doing virtual assisting and decided to focus entirely on my blogging business. I was nervous to get rid of all my clients, but I realized I truly loved blogging myself and not blogging for others.", "By focusing on my business, I was finally able to find ways to diversify my income, improve my blog, increase my traffic, and come up with extra ideas for my blog, such as the course, which now accounts for a big chunk of my income   20%-30%.", "I also was able to focus on affiliate marketing and improving my traffic, which directly relates to making more money blogging as well. It only took me a few months after I dropped all those clients to start seeing the jump in my income.", "I was making $12,000-$15,000 monthly when I decided I was going to focus just on my own business, then I made a jump to the $20,000-$30,000 range, and it just kept going to $40,000, then $50,000, to where I am now at $100,000.", "How has your changing income changed your lifestyle?", "As a full-time blogger I have a flexible schedule and am my own boss and now travel full-time. My husband, who used to be a new car salesman, quit his day job at the same time I quit mine in October 2013 when I was making $10,000 a month from the blog   and now works on the blog too. At the time, we were making more from our day jobs put together than from the blog, but we knew we could live off our blog if we did it full-time.", "The main lifestyle change is that we live in an RV, are location-independent and work wherever we can. We sold our house in Missouri in July 2015 and now we work from wherever.", "Why did you start living in an RV?", "My husband has always wanted to live in an RV, and he spent a long time convincing me to live in an RV. There's always a joke in the RV community that there's always one person who wants to do it and then the other person has to spend years convincing the other person to do it.  That's pretty much how it was.", "But I stepped into an RV one day   we just decided to look at one   and I loved being in it. So we decided to give RVing a shot. It was just going to be a weekend thing to see family or do short weekend or week trips, but we came to love it and never went home. We would be gone for a month or two at a time, so we just decided to turn the RV thing into a full-time venture and haven't looked back since.", "How big was your house? ", "We had a finished basement, and so if you count that, 2,500 square feet. If you don't, it was 1,200 square feet with three bedrooms.", "How big is the RV?", "It's 400 square feet if you include all the slides being out.", "Did you have to get rid of a lot of stuff?", "Yes, the Salvation Army came and took a bunch of stuff, and we rented a dumpster to collect broken appliances and junk and we had neighbors come and just take whatever they wanted for free. We kept clothing and photo albums.", "How does living in an RV make your finances different from other people's?", "It doesn't really change. Our RV cost more than our house, but RVing can be as cheap or expensive as you want it to be   just like with a normal home. There are cheap RVs, and there are RVs worth millions of dollars. It's comparable to living in a home, but I have a different view all the time. There are free places to stay, but we mainly choose private campgrounds or state parks that cost money.", "We usually stay in one place for a month. We like to follow the weather, so we like to stay in a forever 70-degree weather area, and we like to follow activities we like such as riding our bikes outside and going for a hike, so 70-degree weather is what we're looking for all year long.", "How has all this newfound wealth changed you?", "I'm not as stressed about money as I was just a few years ago. But I'm just as frugal as before. It's not below me to use a coupon. I just don't like to be wasteful. If there's a way to save money, I'm not going to waste time to find ways to save money, but if a money saver is there, I'll go for it.", "How has your wealth changed your relationships?", "It really hasn't changed them too much. We're often told that people are surprised we're the same and that you would expect people making $100,000 a month to not be as nice or down to earth. But many of our friends still call us down-to-earth.", "How was money handled when you were growing up and what habits or attitudes did you carry into adulthood? ", "My mom wasn't super good with money, but my dad was better, so I learned what to do from him. He taught me how to live within my budget and also how to use a credit card correctly. A lot of people think credit cards are the root of all evil, but you can use them to build your credit score and you can earn rewards points with them.", "I'm still very frugal. I don't pay for any form of TV, I don't have cable, Netflix, Hulu or anything like that. We haven't spent any money on TV since February 2015 to save money and also to not spend as much time watching TV. I feel like there's plenty of things to watch on local channels. If I had any more channels, I'd be in front of the TV all day long.", "How much time do you spend on your blog?", "Between 40 and 60 hours a week. I work longer hours when I'm trying to get far ahead in my blog content. I currently do three blog posts a week.", "Do you have help?", "I do have an editor who edits my site and a tech person to make sure my site is always up and live and no one is hacking it.", "What do you do with your extra income? ", "We invest a lot in Vanguard funds and are saving for retirement one day. By next year, we should have plenty of money to retire early if we chose too. But I still love blogging, so I don't see that ending anytime soon.", "For the next few years, we plan on RVing here and in Canada, and then afterward sailing full-time and go to other countries. I'd have to find ways to manage my internet access. But we do know many bloggers who blog full-time and sail, so it's not impossible."], "targetTitle": "How This 27-Year-Old Made $1 Million Last Year", "targetDescription": "Four years ago, Michelle Schroeder-Gardner was almost $40,000 in debt.

Concrete boxes are replaced with olive groves, and the words \"traffic jam\" tend to mean that a group of goats have convened, gathering and blocking the road. Needless to say, I greatly enjoy the small villages of the Peloponnese. So when George Papageorgiou, the owner of Esti Olive Oil, asked me if I wanted to go to Kalamata to see how they harvest the olives and turn them into olive oil, I jumped at the chance. To me this was kind of like winning the lottery. I was going to the Peloponnese and getting a chance to enjoy some \"liquid gold.\"", "Being Greek, I grew up eating olive oil. I know others might disagree with me, but I will take a good quality olive oil over butter any day! I love using it to make popcorn. I drizzle it on fresh tomatoes and slices of bread. I use it to fry fish and as an ingredient in cakes. Before there were rules for the amount of liquid you could carrying on a plane, my mother and I would bring half-gallon containers of olive oil back from our trips to Greece.", "The best olive oils come from Greece. I say this with objectivity as a chef, and would like to think that this overrides any bias that my Greek heritage holds. In Greece it is said that the best of Greek olive oils come from the Peloponnese. For years I have wished that Greeks would be more like the Italians. The Italians do a fantastic job of exporting and promoting their products to other countries. With the booming introduction of Greek yogurt into the U.S., I'm hoping that Greek olive oil will soon follow suit. George Papageorgiou is trying to make that happen.", "The Esti olive grove in Kalamata is located in a beautiful sunlit valley. The grove of mature olive trees look as if they belong in Greek mythology. The olives must be harvested at a specific time during the ripening process. Like Goldilocks searching amongst the belongings of the three bears, George is in constant search for the olives that are \"just right.\" If the olives are too green the olive oil produced will taste bitter. If the olives are too black, the quality of the olive oil will be lost. It's a constant balancing act.", "As we headed into the olive grove, numerous fine mesh nets were being laid down to gather and catch all the olives. Workers set up ladders to reach the tall branches. The lower hanging branches were gently being shaken, taking care not to wound the trees. I began to collect olives in my little basket. As my hands turned a reddish-brown, I reminisced about the days I used to spend as a child, collecting olives with my yiayia.", "We took the gathered olives back to the production plant where George had them ground into paste using large millstones. \"This,\" he explained \"is the traditional method used for making olive oil.\" After grinding, the paste then gets slowly stirred in a separate container for 20 to 40 minutes. This is a process known as malaxation. With malaxation the slow churning action allows the small droplets of oil that were released in the milling process to aggregate, forming large droplets of oil which facilitates mechanical extraction. I was a bit overwhelmed during the whole process. I looked around the manufacturing facility, much like a child the first time they visit Disneyland. I snapped pictures. I wanted to see what was behind every door. I asked George if the oil we had witnessed being made was virgin or extra virgin. I had always assumed that the grading of \"extra virgin\" denoted a different process or different stage in the olive's ripeness. George shook his head. This was not correct. In fact, all olive oil produced by physical (mechanical) means is virgin. The differentiation of \"extra virgin\" is the virgin olive oil that satisfies specific high chemical and organoleptic criteria. In layman's terms it is the virgin olive oil that has low free acidity and no quality defects.", "The final room we visited that day was lined with shiny steel tanks, much like a winery. The storage of the olive oil in steel tanks helps to preserve it and keep it from oxidizing. It's the final resting place for the olive oil before it is bottled.", "In Greek, the word theoxenia comes from mythology and relates to hospitality; how hosts treat guests or even strangers. It's an important part of Greek culture. This was something George clearly keeps in mind. Before leaving the facility that day, George sent me home with a box filled with bottles of olive oil: virgin, extra virgin, organic extra virgin. That night, and many nights since, I have enjoyed his olive oils. In each bite I can taste the olive grove and its bright sun-kissed fruit. I can't help but think that everyone, even the French, might fall in love with olive oil if they had a chance to taste the Greek rendition."], "targetTitle": "Making Olive Oil in the Peloponnese", "targetDescription": "Even though the Peloponnese is only an hour's drive away from Athens, it's as if you're entering another world, or at least another country.

That\u2019s when he faces hate to be an alarmist, but Donald Trump could be on course to be elected president of the United States \u2013 and the decisive moment may well come on Monday night. That\u2019s when he faces Hillary Clinton in what is expected to be one of the most watched events in television history. The TV debates are perhaps the last chance for her to persuade the American people that this man is unqualified for, and unworthy of, the presidency and poses a genuine threat to the republic.", "If that sounds like panic, then I\u2019m not the only one. Sweaty-palmed nausea has become a leading symptom among those who tremble at the prospect of a Trump presidency. A new Slate podcast is called Time to Panic . Number cruncher Nate Silver, who gives Trump a 40% probability of winning, triggered another round of liberal angst this week when he tweeted that he had \"Never seen otherwise smart people in so much denial about something as they are about Trump\u2019s chances. Same mistake as primaries, Brexit.\"", "Never seen otherwise smart people in so much denial as they are about Trump\u2019s chances. Same mistake as Brexit Nate Silver", "The source of the alarm is not so much the national polls, where Clinton is a few points ahead, but surveys from those battleground states where the presidency will be decided. In the last week, polls have put Trump in front in Ohio, Nevada, North Carolina and, most neuralgic of all, Florida.", "So low are expectations for his performance on Monday \u2013 where it is assumed that his opponent, a seasoned debater, will wipe the floor with him \u2013 that if Trump manages to speak in vaguely coherent sentences and not deliver a misogynist insult to Clinton\u2019s face, his advocates will declare that he looked \"presidential\" and anoint him the winner. If he can somehow persuade wavering voters that he is not so ridiculous as to merit automatic disqualification, he will have cleared a crucial hurdle.", "And for all her experience, Clinton heads towards this first, and therefore most important, debate facing some serious obstacles. She\u2019s been advised that she mustn\u2019t interrupt too much or talk over Trump: apparently voters react badly to seeing a woman act that way. According to a New York Times report well sourced from inside Hillary\u2019s debate preparation team, \"she does not want to be seen as pushy and play into gender stereotypes\". This was not something Barack Obama, or husband Bill, ever had to worry about.", "Activists in Berlin dismantle what they called a Wall of Hate showing Donald Trump in front of the Brandenburg Gate on 23 September.", "But Trump himself presents her with an unprecedented conundrum. How does she take on a candidate who lies and lies and lies? One reporter following Trump has taken to logging the falsehoods he tells each day: no small task.", "Take two areas where you\u2019d assume that to be caught in untruth would be terminal for a presidential candidate. Trump has been exposed for serial lying over 9/11 , falsely claiming to have lost hundreds of friends that day; to have seen thousands of Muslims cheering the fall of the twin towers; and to have helped in the rescue effort. He even milked cash from a 9/11 relief fund.", "This week he was found to have raided $258,000 from the charitable foundation that bears his name to settle assorted legal problems. Earlier he dipped into that same charity box, filled by others\u2019 donations, to pay for a larger than life $10,000 painting \u2013 of himself. He lies about 9/11. He lies about charity. But on he strides.", "But Trump himself presents her with an unprecedented conundrum. How does she take on a candidate who lies and lies and lies?\u2019", "So where can Hillary begin? If she calls him a liar, he\u2019ll hit back over her use of a private email server, calling her Crooked Hillary, knowing that some 60% of Americans believe she\u2019s dishonest. The risk is that he\u2019ll use her experience and expertise against her, casting her as the boring know-it-all against the freewheeling, entertaining guy who relies on good old gut instinct.", "If that sounds familiar, that\u2019s because it\u2019s a show we\u2019ve already seen. In 2000 Al Gore was clearly the more accomplished, ready-for-office candidate. But he came across as impatient and pompous against the looser, backslapping George W Bush. Never mind that one was a visionary on the issue of climate change while the other would lead the US into the catastrophic invasion of Iraq. On the night, Bush came across better on TV.", "Which brings us to a core problem facing Hillary Clinton. Polls show there are millions of voters, especially young ones, who agree in big numbers that Trump is a racist and a sexist, unqualified for America\u2019s highest office \u2013 but who are refusing to back Clinton. One survey of 18- to 34-year-olds recorded dire numbers for Trump, but still found only 31% supporting Clinton, with 29% preferring libertarian Gary Johnson and 15% the Green candidate Jill Stein. If those numbers are replicated on election day, Trump will win.", "This too stirs queasy memories of 2000. In that year, a small but significant bloc on the left voted for Ralph Nader instead of Gore. More than 90,000 voted for Nader in Florida, a state Gore was eventually deemed to have lost by just 537 votes. Had even a tiny fraction of those Naderites decided to hold their nose and choose Gore instead, there would have been no Bush presidency \u2013 and no Iraq war.", "I know this is a sore, and contested, point among those who chose Nader, who to this day blame Gore for not doing enough to appeal to the left (forgetting perhaps that he also had to appeal to centrist voters in order to win the election). But the basic case is surely clear. In a two-party system like America\u2019s, if you want to stop Trump, then a vote for Johnson or Stein will not do it. Only a vote for Clinton can prevent a white nationalist bigot becoming the next US president.", "You might think this is all so obvious that it barely needs stating. But 2000 can seem like ancient history to those who don\u2019t remember it. And here, younger voters are not to blame. Older liberals haven\u2019t seared the Bush calamity into the minds of the next generation. They never turned 2000 into a cautionary tale of the cost of third-party indulgence. As the New Republic put it this week, \"Liberals have failed to teach millennials about the horror of George W Bush.\" (Republicans, meanwhile, bang on about the supposedly dismal presidency of Jimmy Carter to this day, just as British Conservatives invoked the 1979 \"winter of discontent\" for over three decades. It is the centre-left that is oddly reticent about exploiting its opponents\u2019 history of failure.)", "So now, even though the hour is late, this is the case Democrats must make. That this is an exceptional election because Donald Trump represents an exceptional menace, to America and to the world. It is indeed a referendum on Trump and the only way to vote no in that referendum is to vote Clinton. She may not be the candidate of your dreams, but she\u2019s all that stands between you and an American nightmare.", "You don\u2019t have to love her. You don\u2019t even have to like her. You\u2019re not saying she\u2019s flawless (though the current Democratic platform is its most progressive in 30 years, thanks in part to the challenge of Bernie Sanders).

And, as is usual pattern, more and more credible leaks have come out about what will presumably be called the iPhone 7", "Bloomberg probably has the most accurate reporting thus far (thanks to its hiring of Apple reporter Mark Gurman) in a report that basically confirms what has leaked out about the iPhone over the next few months. The big news is that the form factor will remain largely the same, there will be a dual-lens camera system for the larger iPhone, and the home button will provide haptic feedback rather than depress like a physical button. Oh yeah, and the headphone jack ? It's dead. Dunzo", "Let's all take a moment of silence for the headphone jack.", "Not to downplay the new stuff (though I have thoughts on that, just wait), it's worth noting that this follows my playbook for bulletproof iPhone predictions to a tee.", "In case you need a reminder, this is what we can always expect from a new iPhone:", "It will be Apple's fastest iPhone ever.", "It will have Apple's most advanced optics.", "There will be at least one extra feature you can't get on any other iPhone.", "It will come in rose gold.", "And now, I guess we can add, \"it won't have a headphone jack.\"", "Still, I'm sure I'm not the only person who looks at the leaks of the next iPhone and says, \"Huh. OK.\"", "\ue600 \ue601 \ue602 \ue605 If we're being honest, this probably won't be the most exciting iPhone release we've seen.", "This isn't to say I won't still buy the next iPhone \u2014 I'm TOTALLY going to buy the new iPhone in September \u2014 but if we're being honest, this probably won't be the most exciting iPhone release we've seen.", "Personally, I think that's OK. I'm not completely sure how I feel about Apple potentially shifting the design upgrade from every two years to every three \u2014 new colors aside, that makes it really hard to show off that you've got the latest and greatest phone \u2014 but now that we're nearly a decade into the modern smartphone era, it might not be realistic to expect new designs every other year.", "Regardless of what other whiz-bang goodness Apple introduces this year \u2014 and I'm sure there will be at least one feature that will make even the most jaded amongst us salivate \u2014 the reality is that this will absolutely be the iPhone remembered as \"the one where Apple dropped the headphone jack.\"", "That's it. Pack it up.", "Waterproof casing, wireless charging, better battery life and more powerful optics could all be things we see. And these would be amazing upgrades \u2014 old design or not \u2014 but the real headline is that this is the first iPhone without a headphone jack.", "I can say with absolute certainty that every major review of the device is going to focus substantially on this fact.", "And thinking about it, I have to wonder: Is Apple making such an enormous and potentially unpopular change this year so that next year's iPhone \u2014 you know, the one that might have an all-glass display and an ultra-sharp AMOLED screen \u2014 won't suffer? That's the phone that might ditch the home button altogether. It's also the phone that will coincidentally be released the same year as the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone.", "And Apple loves to celebrate anniversaries.", "\ue600 \ue601 \ue602 \ue605 A 20th Anniversary Edition Macintosh from 1997. Fun fact: This was one of the first product designs from Jony Ive. Image: Christie's auction house", "Downplaying the iPhone 7 so the NEXT iPhone can thrive", "Maybe I'm reading too much into the tea leaves, but it strikes me that Apple could be deliberately cutting the headphone jack this year \u2014 a year that is already going to be less exciting by virtue of no major redesign \u2014 in order to protect the next iPhone from the inevitable backlash over the headphone jack's removal.", "\ue600 \ue601 \ue602 \ue605 The backlash will be angrier than when Apple changed from the 30-pin connector to the Lightning port.", "Yes, yes, I've been telling everyone to accept that the headphone jack is dead since January . A frequent point of discussion on our podcast, MashTalk , has been about the headphone jack and where all of us are in facing reality. Even Tech Editor Pete Pachal has come around to see the light. The jack is dead.", "And there will be backlash. The backlash will be angrier than when Apple changed from the 30-pin connector to the Lightning port (making all of those old dock accessories obsolete) and the rallying cry from pundits is already louder than it was when Apple decided to not include a floppy drive on the original iMac.", "I feel very certain that, backlash aside, the ultimate fallout of a headphone jack-free iPhone will be minimal. People will grumble. Adapters will be annoying and we'll all bitch and moan about how Bluetooth just isn't good enough. But we'll survive and within a year, most of us will be used to using either Lightning headphones, dongles or snazzy wireless options. We'll have moved on.", "Which of course, means that the buzz around the 2017 iPhone will be all positive. New design, new screen and some other snazzy feature. But that missing headphone jack? So last year's problem.", "And that's why, the more I think about it, the more I feel like the iPhone 7 has to be a little bit boring so that we can get really hyped about the next big iPhone, and it needs to drop the headphone jack now, so the 10th anniversary iPhone doesn't carry that particular scarlet letter.", "Despite the inevitable death of the headphone jack, I'm still going to buy the iPhone 7.

She published this in The Boston Globe today.", "The Massachusetts assault weapons ban mirrors the federal ban Congress allowed to expire in 2004. It prohibits the sale of specific weapons like the Colt AR-15 and AK-47 and explicitly bans \"copies or duplicates\" of those weapons. But gun manufacturers have taken it upon themselves to define what a \"copy\" or \"duplicate\" weapon is. They market \"state compliant\" copycat versions of their assault weapons to Massachusetts buyers. They sell guns without a flash suppressor or folding or telescoping stock, for example, small tweaks that do nothing to limit the lethalness of the weapon. That will end now. On Wednesday, we are sending a directive to all gun manufacturers and dealers that makes clear that the sale of these copycat assault weapons is illegal in Massachusetts. With this directive, we will ensure we get the full protection intended when lawmakers enacted our assault weapons ban, not the watered-down version of those protections offered by gun manufacturers. The directive specifically outlines two tests to determine what constitutes a \"copy\" or \"duplicate\" of a prohibited weapon. If a gun\u2019s operating system is essentially the same as that of a banned weapon, or if the gun has components that are interchangeable with those of a banned weapon, it\u2019s a \"copy\" or \"duplicate,\" and it is illegal.

In the dozen years since the federal assault weapons ban lapsed, only seven states have instituted their own assault weapons ban. Many of those bans have been challenged (unsuccessfully) by the gun industry, and we anticipate our directive may be too. But our job is to enforce state laws and to keep people safe. This directive does both.", "Right. Because the criminals who are shooting up campuses and theaters and police protests\u2013they\u2019re all easily stopped by enacting a simple bit of legislation.

Not only do we have the legal authority to do so, we have a moral obligation to do so.", "Wait\u2013to get the guns off the street?

Typically, uranium ore is made up of three types (isotopes) of uranium, each one with a different number of neutrons: Uranium 238, which is the most abundant, uranium 234, which is the rarest, and uranium 235, which nuclear scientists are most interested in because it can sustain nuclear chain reactions.", "One would expect to find that the uranium ore is composed of 0.720% uranium 235, since that is the percentage found in other rock samples from the Earth's crust, the Moon and even meteorites. However, these French scientists found something fishy: The uranium sample only contained 0.717% of uranium 235. What might seem to be a minor discrepancy of 0.003% is very significant with regards to uranium.", "That meant that, back at the mine, around 200 kilograms (around 440 pounds) of uranium 235 appeared to be missing. It hadn't been lost or stolen. Instead, this missing 0.003% had undergone nuclear fission and split into other atoms. This conclusion may very well have furrowed some brows since there are three very specific conditions that a reactor needs to churn out energy continuously. And as even scientists had struggled to create a nuclear reactor, it seemed unlikely that nature just happened to create one purely by accident.", "Unlikely, but not impossible, because that is exactly what happened.", "The conditions that the natural reactor happened to fulfill are as follows.", "The first was owning a good percentage of Uranium 235 to fuel the reaction. While 0.720% might seem small, it's perfect for nuclear fission, and when the ore samples from Okla are compared to other samples from all over the world, it is likely that this was the percentage over 2 billion years ago when the reactor started.", "The second condition is a source of neutrons. Uranium 235 decays naturally into thorium and releases a neutron in the process. This neutron can then whoosh towards another Uranium 235 atom and start the fission process. Nuclear fission is when an atom breaks apart into smaller atoms, usually releasing energy in the process. This neutron fuses with a Uranium 235, and together they combine to form Uranium 236, which is unstable. The Uranium 236 is then overwhelmed with instability and splits, creating a variety of smaller, stable atoms and some neutrons. These neutrons can then happily shoot towards other atoms and continue the chain reaction.", "The nuclear reactor had a supply of a regulating substance as well: a flow of natural groundwater. As the atoms started to split, they released neutrons as well as energy. The water would slow down the neutrons, but the energy would heat up the water. After a time, the water would get so hot that it would start to boil off. Eventually, enough of the water would have boiled away until there wasn't enough left in the reactor to slow down the neutrons. The neutrons started shooting off into the ground without reacting with anything, and the reaction would stop. Then, the natural flow of groundwater would trickle in until there was enough water to start the whole process again. This watery cycle probably continued for hundreds of thousands of years.", "Sadly, all good days are numbered, even for a happy natural reactor: The levels of uranium 235 got used up and the level was too low to sustain any more meaningful reactions. The reactor eventually slowed to a stop, leaving only a few traces behind that it ever existed \u2013 including the enigma of the \"missing uranium.\"", "Featured Image: Danilo Russo/Flickr", "Source: Naturally Occurring Nuclear Fission"], "targetTitle": "Is There Really A 2 Billion-Year-Old Nuclear Reactor In Africa?", "targetDescription": "An ancient\u00a0nuclear reactor that was churning away\u00a02 billion years ago sounds like a fabricated myth.

Lighting, air quality, humidity and pests can all play a massive role in the end product, so growing weed may be pretty easy, but growing great weed can be pretty taxing. ", "As the Post points out, when researchers are testing the effects of marijuana, they need to test the real thing that people are actually growing, buying and consuming. But the cannabis being supplied to researchers currently is far from something you'd typically buy in a dispensary in Denver. Or getting from an illegal delivery service in New York City.

It doesn\u2019t smell like cannabis.'", "\"It doesn\u2019t resemble cannabis. It doesn\u2019t smell like cannabis,\" she said.", "Not only is the weed bad, but Sisley claims it was moldy as well. So the government clearly doesn't have it together when it comes to growing pot.", "All of the cannabis provided for medical research comes from a 12-acre farm located at the University of Mississippi. The farm is run by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and is the only facility licensed by the DEA to grow pot for research, since marijuana remains a schedule 1 drug to the DEA. (It's classified in a category with heroin and ecstasy, which also makes a lot of sense.)", "Rick Doblin, MAPS\u2019 director, blasted NIDA's capabilities by telling PBS, \"They\u2019re in no way capable of assuming the rights and responsibilities for handling a drug that we\u2019re hoping to be approved by the FDA as prescription medicine. \"", "When confronted about the mold and potency, NIDA and the University of Mississippi told PBS that neither test the samples for mold before they're shipped.", "Sisely had the samples provided by the government tested by an independent lab in Colorado as a part of typical protocol. There they found high levels of total yeast and mold in some samples, as well as potency that didn't match what they had ordered. One sample was supposed to contain 13 percent THC \u2014 it reportedly had just 8 percent. ", "Shockingly, 13 percent THC is the highest percentage NIDA offers. In Colorado you can walk into a dispensary and buy weed that is easily 20 percent, sometimes upwards of 30 percent. ", "NIDA blamed the mold problem on the lab, saying they didn't handle it properly when they left it in a refrigerator for two days instead of freezing it. MAPS fired back, saying the weed with elevated total yeast and mold counts \"were found in samples that never left the freezer before testing,\" according to PBS.", "While it was determined the mold variety in the cannabis was not harmful to adults, it's clear that the United States needs to form better quality control and standards testing for cannabis, be it medical, recreational or for research. Regardless of how you feel about marijuana, the effects of the plant deserve to be properly researched, and right now, it appears they aren't.

It shows a serious lack of understanding of what OCD is and does, and is a subtle yet powerful way of saying \"Oh, we all have that! It's not that big of a deal.\"", "Because even if color-coding your closet is an annoying habit -- and I'll give it to you, maybe even an \"obsession\" or \"compulsion\" -- your comment comparing this to actual, medically-diagnosed OCD comes off as an underhanded way of telling me that it's not only something that everyone has, but something that doesn't warrant psychiatric or therapeutic attention. For my disorder, it's a response that I would equate to saying that you understand someone's pain over the death of an parent because you once had a pet that died. Thanks for the effort, but no thanks for comparing my dead mother to your dead goldfish.", "Now, I know this isn't your intention, and I try to keep this in mind as I grind my teeth and try to explain somehow, that no, that really is not the same thing.

Most of the buildings are similar. People's clothes, on the whole, aren't all that different, give or take a few shoulder pads.", "One thing stands out: all of the cars look super boxy, especially compared with the curving, rounded exteriors of virtually every car on the market today.", "This underappreciated transformation is probably the most distinct design change to come to cars over the past half-century, and for most US cars, it happened within just a few years, starting in 1986. You can even pinpoint the exact year curves arrived for some models \u2014 like the Buick LeSabre, which had much harder edges along its hood, roof, and trunk in 1991 (left) than 1992 (right):", "In the decades since, cars have just gotten curvier and curvier. Why the big shift?", "It turns out it was largely due to three interrelated factors: European style trends, a government-mandated push for fuel economy, and new technologies that allowed manufacturers to more easily design and create curved shapes.", "It all started with European luxury designs", "By the 1980s, making curved cars wasn't an entirely novel idea \u2014 it had just largely gone out of fashion among US automakers. The streamliners of the 1930s, such as the Chrysler Airflow, had a sleek look designed to minimize wind resistance.", "But the Airflow and other streamlined American models were commercial failures, outsold by bigger, boxier cars. Through the 1970s, almost every American-made car had hard, sharp edges, with few curves. They were uniformly designed as a series of three connected boxes: the hood, the cabin, and the trunk.", "In Europe, though, fuel was always more expensive, and designers \u2014 especially in Germany \u2014 explored aerodynamic designs much earlier on, says Penny Sparke, author of A Century of Car Design. In the 1960s and '70s, luxury automakers like Porsche, BMW, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz were some of the first to reintroduce curved exteriors.", "One of the earliest, most well-known examples is the Porsche 911, which was pretty curvy way back when it was introduced in 1963:", "This aesthetic eventually became associated with these luxury cars, both in Europe and in the US, where they arrived as imports. And inevitably, writes historian David Gartman in Auto Opium: A Social History of American Automobile Design, \"American automakers began to copy the European aerodynamic aesthetic in the mid-1980s as a way of courting upscale consumers.\"", "Ford, more than any other company, was responsible for bringing this design change to the mass market. Designer Uwe Bahnsen did it first in Europe with the 1982 Ford Sierra, which was far more curved than similar cars of its era:", "Reviewers panned the look (nicknaming it the \"jelly mould\"), and the car did not sell well at first. Over time, though, buyers got used it \u2014 especially as other manufacturers eventually copied the style for their own cars.", "In the US, Ford designer Jack Telnack \u2014 who'd worked on the company's European design team before taking over North American design in 1980 \u2014 was most directly responsible for the shift to curves. His 1983 Ford Thunderbird design was heavily shaped by wind tunnel testing, prioritizing aerodynamic lines. The look soon filtered down to the mass market with the 1986 Taurus:", "It might look unremarkable today, but the design was positively futuristic at the time. The car was even used in the movie RoboCop, which was supposed to take place in the near future. The Taurus, writes Gartman, \"was definitely aiming at the upscale market of young, well-educated buyers to whom the BMW appealed.\"", "The strategy worked. The Taurus was a huge hit, with massive sales that saved the struggling company \u2014 and inspired a wave of copycat American cars.", "Automakers had to improve fuel economy", "Part of the reason the curvy look proliferated so quickly and is still with us today is basic physics. Curved exteriors and more steeply pitched windshields make for less wind resistance, as air can flow more easily over them. This means less gas has to be burned to move the car the same distance at the same speed.", "Right as the Taurus premiered, automakers were dealing with Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards for the first time. Starting in 1978, the average fuel economy of each manufacturer's passenger car fleet sold in the US had to reach higher and higher levels, before plateauing in 1990 at 27.5 miles per gallon.", "While automakers had already achieved some gains in efficiency with improved engines and other components, the new curved aesthetic made it much easier and cheaper to achieve further improvements. \"One Ford designer claimed that while it would cost $200 to $300 million to achieve a one-tenth-mile-per-gallon increase by engineering 'under the hood,' aero design achieved a three- to four-tenths m.p.g. increase for almost nothing,\" Gartman writes.", "Automakers began relying more heavily on wind tunnels and aerodynamic calculations when designing their cars, and engineers started working more closely with designers. Within just a few years, virtually every car on the market suddenly looked like the once-futuristic Taurus. \"They all looked the same because they were all being shaped in the wind tunnel, and were designed for fuel economy,\" says Larry Edsall, the author of several books on car design history.", "Technology made it easier to produce curves", "A few key technological developments made these designs possible \u2014 and have since allowed automakers to make their cars curvier and curvier.", "For decades, designers had made car models using clay, wood, or other physical materials. During the 1980s, they began using computer models.", "\"It's much easier to make these sorts of shapes with computer drawings, rather than wood,\" Sparke says. \"They gave automakers the means to produce those very soft curves.\" Manufacturing technologies also made it easier and cheaper to produce curved shapes in aluminum than before.", "As a result, since that initial shift in the 1990s, exteriors have only become curvier. You can get a good sense of how profound the change has been by looking at a newer car thought to be remarkably boxy: the Scion xB.", "Sure, it has a big, blocky hatchback. But its edges are still way more rounded than the truly boxy cars of the '80s \u2014 and even the groundbreaking, futuristic 1986 Ford Taurus.", "Verge Video: This is the driverless future Mercedes Benz thinks we'll have in the year 2030"], "targetTitle": "Why cars went from boxy in the '80s to curvy in the '90s", "targetDescription": "The story behind the most underappreciated design shift in automotive history.", "targetKeywords": null, "targetMedia": ["https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53521487/Screen_Shot_2017_03_03_at_2.18.56_PM.0.png", "https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3778782/1280px-Sierra_3_door_-_an_early_one.jpg", "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53529619/_94928968_originalpic.0.jpg", "https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53525779/zeldabreath.0.jpg", "https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53484121/medicine1.0.jpg", "https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3779182/1280px-2008_Scion_xB.jpg", "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3778670/1280px-1934ChryslerAirflow.jpg", "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53527277/Screen_Shot_2017_03_03_at_6.39.44_PM.1488585270.png", "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53525779/zeldabreath.0.jpg", "https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3779596/GettyImages-537571797.0.jpg", "https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3778714/1280px-Porsche_911E_ca_1969.jpg", "https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53519805/shutterstock_554313283.0.jpg", "https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3778804/1280px-1st_Ford_Taurus_GL_sedan.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs", "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sNbPdMLpZzB6TfKl0voz4_hJU6A=/33x0:700x371/1080x600/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/46514026/Screen_Shot_2015-06-10_at_5.50.34_PM.0.0.png", "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53520017/625496290.0.jpg", "https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3779228/5892655822_2ccb375564_o.jpg", "https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53527277/Screen_Shot_2017_03_03_at_6.39.44_PM.1488585270.png", "https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3779368/GettyImages-783770.jpg", "https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53532165/arnold.0.png", "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3779340/GettyImages-103232313.jpg"], "targetUrl": "http://www.vox.com/2015/6/11/8762373/car-design-curves", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "better aerodynamics which leads to better fuel economy. duh.", "spoilerPublisher": "savedyouaclick"}, "spoiler": ["largely due to three interrelated factors: European style trends, a government-mandated push for fuel economy, and new technologies that allowed manufacturers to more easily design and create curved shapes."], "spoilerPositions": [[[4, 20], [4, 226]]], "tags": ["passage"], "predicted_labels": 0}

The bad news is that it involves women pretending that they are men.", "In a column in the Wall Street Journal, John Greathouse of Rincon Venture Partners outlined his belief that women will get more opportunities in tech if they \"create an online presence that obscures their gender.\" Bizarrely equating hiring practices in tech to blind orchestra auditions, Greathouse suggested that women do things like only use their first initial and eliminate photos on both Twitter and LinkedIn. Rather than call on tech companies to overcome the unconscious bias that can too easily be baked into hiring practices, Greathouse thinks women should solve the problem themselves by hiding who they really are.", "\"[The column] made me really mad.\" said Angela Dalton , a managing director at Guggenheim. \"It\u2019s wrong on so many levels. It perpetuates the trap that women fall into that if I put my head down and just work, I will get noticed... Success is competency, yes, but it\u2019s also personality and warmth.\"", "I sat down with Dalton as well as three other female investors for a panel discussion today at TAP , a tech conference in New York. The topic of our chat was the future of mobile investing, but with the industry abuzz with disbelief about the column, our conversation inevitably changed direction. [Greathouse did not respond to an email I sent him requesting comment. In a tweet, he apologized for the column.]", "Heidi Roizen , an operating partner at DFJ, said that when she started in venture capital, she was routinely the only woman in the room. After becoming aware of the gender bias that pervades the tech industry, Roizen decided to give her two children gender-neutral names. That way when their applied to jobs later in life, the recruiter wouldn\u2019t know if they were male or female.", "\"This is sad, but it is also true,\" said Roizen. \"Yes we did to change things, but we need to recognize the reality for what it is.\"", "Nimi Katragadda , a principal at BoxGroup, agreed with Roizen that you can\u2019t ignore the problem, but said that hiding your identity entirely to overcome bias was \"asinine\u2019 advice.", "\"Why should you hide your identity because the person on the other end of the table is backwards?\" she said. \"You are making the problem worse that way.\"", "The fact that all the investors on stage for my panel were women was not an accident. In fact, the conference organizers were trying to combat the gender gap in tech by doing the exact opposite of what Greathouse suggested. After having a difficult time recruiting female speakers for last year\u2019s conference -- a problem that plagues most tech events -- the organizers intentionally set out with the goal of having more than 50% female speakers. Highlighting female voices was the conference\u2019s way of signaling to leaders in the room that diversity in leadership roles should be a priority.", "\"We know that companies that have diverse teams do better,\" said Susanne Greenfield , a Director at Priceline Group. \"But there is this unconscious bias. People want to hire and promote people who are similar to them. You have to do something to fight that bias.\"", "As a LinkedIn editor, I regularly work with thought leaders in tech who share their insights on our publishing platform. Rather than encourage female writers to mask their identity and experiences, I suggest they own it. In order to combat the misguided notion that the tech industry is only comprised of male leaders, women must share their expertise on social networks so that audiences hear a diverse set of perspectives. To get more women interested in pursuing careers in technology, current female leaders must continue to strive to be seen, rather than hide like Greathouse suggests."], "targetTitle": "This 'sad' advice a male VC just gave to women in tech couldn't be more wrong", "targetDescription": null, "targetKeywords": null, "targetMedia": ["http://archive.is/P8f03/ec47a337d1856ccf914269a1e6aeb01175d51483/scr.png", "http://archive.is/P8f03/a8013950eb57ddcde2b6fb016b645dcdd15065be.jpg", "data:image/png;base64,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", "http://archive.is/P8f03/c37694c12704fb5f281fa6b0a45ee986a7d0f702.jpg", "http://archive.is/P8f03/0e2b720788b240c7fcd0cae5ba9c0e4abab43976.jpg", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex/6gNJowqlzHFZ/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=="], "targetUrl": "http://archive.is/P8f03", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "The advice is to obscure your gender in your online presence", "spoilerPublisher": "savedyouaclick"}, "spoiler": ["pretending that they are men"], "spoilerPositions": [[[0, 161], [0, 189]]], "tags": ["phrase"], "predicted_labels": 0}

Some deaths were caused by accidents or animals. Most, however, were murders committed by heavily armed poachers who enter national parks and other protected areas in search of species such as tigers, rhinos, and elephants.", "At the same time, rangers have killed hundreds of poachers, often spurred by the shoot on sight policies that have become the norm in several parks. The numbers add up: Between 2011 and 2015, rangers at South Africa\u2019s Kruger National Park alone reportedly killed nearly 500 poachers.", "While these rangers are undoubtedly heroes who all too often lay down their lives to protect the animals in their care, some organizations have begun to raise questions about the retaliatory bloodshed, asking if it is ethical or moral for rangers to kill suspected poachers without arrest or trial. The issue came to bear most recently last month after a guard in India\u2019s Kaziranga National Park, which has a shoot-to-kill policy, critically wounded a seven-year-old boy from a tribe that lives around the park.", "\"We\u2019re pretty horrified by the situation,\" said Sophie Grig, senior campaigner at Survival International, a tribal rights organization that has criticized the recent Kaziranga shooting and shoot-to-kill policies in general. \"It seems to us a very worrying trend that is bad for both local people who get caught in the crossfire and for conservation.\"", "Grig also wonders if shooting poachers even solves the larger problem. \"If you were arresting those people and then investigating them, you could trace back and work out who the kingpins are,\" she said. \"If you shoot them dead, you can\u2019t ask them any questions.\"", "Annette Hu\u0308bschle, who recently authored a report on rhino poaching for the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, echoed those sentiments. She said the \"current militarized approach\" is pushing people away from any chance they might have to participate in conservation. \"There should be a greater focus on investigating the transporters and buyers, prosecuting organized criminals such as kingpins and smugglers, \u2018follow the money\u2019 approaches, and seizing assets of criminals,\" she said.", "Aside from legal strategies, the issue of whether or not poachers should be killed brings up several potential lines of ethical thought, said Anna Peterson, a professor in the department of religion at the University of Florida and the author of Being Animal: Beasts and Boundaries in Nature Ethics.", "One way of thinking about it, she said, is to ask if individual sentient beings have value and if there is a difference in that value between a human life and that of a rhinoceros. She pointed to ethicist Tom Regan\u2019s test, which asked if you would throw a dog out of a lifeboat to save yourself. \"Essentially, Regan said you would always throw out the dog on the basis of complexity and what would be lost by a human\u2019s death rather than a dog\u2019s death,\" she said.", "More broadly, Peterson said, you could ask if a species is rare and significant and if its ecosystem would suffer in its absence. This ecological perspective could come into play when discussing species such as rhinos, tigers, and elephants. \"We have that debate here about Florida panthers, which are both rare and important predators,\" she said.", "Finally, Peterson looked at the question from the field of ethics known as war theory. \"The just war theory,\" she said, \"lays out a series of criteria, such as do you have a just cause and have you tried to fix this peacefully?\" If we consider preserving ecosystems to be a just cause, then killing could be justified. Similarly, so could looking at poaching as an economic issue, as it threatens tourism, or as a national security issue, an important consideration involving organized crime, smuggling, national borders, and related crimes such as drugs and weapons.", "No one has easy answers. \"Rangers are doing difficult jobs in difficult circumstances,\" Grig said. She added, though, that the often public enthusiasm for killing poachers seems contrary to the call to protect human rights in just about any other crime. \"I think this is something we need to be discussing,\" she said."], "targetTitle": "Is It Ethical to Kill Poachers?", "targetDescription": "The people who protect the world\u2019s most endangered species are often asked to be judge, jury, and executioner.", "targetKeywords": "Wildlife, Environment, In the News", "targetMedia": ["http://web.archive.org/web/20160804170638im_/http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/styles/inline_thumbnail/public/Bushmeat-Patrol-PROMO-1b.jpg?itok=6fcCSzU-", "http://web.archive.org/web/20160804170638im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=14223123&c3=&c4=http://www.takepart.com/article/2016/08/03/it-ethical-kill-poachers?fb_comment_id=1054182597992671_1054639161280348&comment_id=1054639161280348&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://web.archive.org/web/20160804170638im_/http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/styles/homepage_featured_image/public/elephant-poacher-MAIN.jpg?itok=qC6pBXmq", "http://web.archive.org/web/20160804170638im_/http://www.takepart.com/sites/all/themes/base/images/logo.png", "http://web.archive.org/web/20160804170638im_/http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/styles/homepage_featured_image/public/PromoOwlFire.jpg?itok=CAi6k7nF", "http://web.archive.org/static/images/toolbar/wm_tb_prv_off.png", "http://web.archive.org/static/images/toolbar/wm_tb_nxt_on.png", "http://web.archive.org/web/20160804170638im_/http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/styles/70x70_thumbnail/public/profiles/photos/jornrplattbiopic.jpg?itok=vDbxsYXg", "http://web.archive.org/static/images/toolbar/wayback-toolbar-logo.png", "http://web.archive.org/web/jsp/graph.jsp?graphdata=550_27_1996:-1:000000000000_1997:-1:000000000000_1998:-1:000000000000_1999:-1:000000000000_2000:-1:000000000000_2001:-1:000000000000_2002:-1:000000000000_2003:-1:000000000000_2004:-1:000000000000_2005:-1:000000000000_2006:-1:000000000000_2007:-1:000000000000_2008:-1:000000000000_2009:-1:000000000000_2010:-1:000000000000_2011:-1:000000000000_2012:-1:000000000000_2013:-1:000000000000_2014:-1:000000000000_2015:-1:000000000000_2016:7:000000030000_2017:-1:000000000000", "http://web.archive.org/web/20160804170638im_/http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/styles/homepage_featured_image/public/rhino-promo.jpg?itok=pqNxq11Q", "http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/elephant-poachers.jpg"], "targetUrl": "http://web.archive.org/web/20160804170638/http://www.takepart.com/article/2016/08/03/it-ethical-kill-poachers?cmpid=tp-ptnr-huffpost", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "No. [takepart]", "spoilerPublisher": "savedyouaclick"}, "spoiler": ["preserving ecosystems to be a just cause, then killing could be justified"], "spoilerPositions": [[[10, 244], [10, 317]]], "tags": ["passage"], "predicted_labels": 0}

A perfectly legitimate charge has been flagged as fraudulent, and the result is an agitated customer and a retailer with unsold merchandise.", "MasterCard has now turned to artificial intelligence to better differentiate between real and mistaken fraud, hoping to tamp down on the former while allowing the latter to go through. It\u2019s the latest financial services company to see the potential for the burgeoning field of machine learning to improve security on its network and enhance the customer experience.", "Financial institutions have for years collected data on customers\u2019 habits and routines, and used the information to pinpoint cards that may have been compromised. That\u2019s the reason your card may be declined if you make an unusually large purchase, shop at a store for the first time, or buy gas in a place far from home. The system is essentially deciding whether that behavior seems normal according to predetermined questions, then accepting or declining the purchase based on its decision.", "\"The old method was using tests and thresholds and other sorts of rules. With a rules-based approach, you get a tremendous amount of false positives,\" said Todd Marlin, a principal in Ernst & Young\u2019s forensic technology and discovery services practice.", "\"What we\u2019re seeing is sort of a gold rush into artificial intelligence,\" Marlin said.", "Machine learning can help fraud-detection systems become smarter about what fraud actually looks like, both across the network and on an individual level. For example, the system might detect that you haven\u2019t shopped at a particular merchant in the past, but still accept the purchase because customers with a similar spending history shop there often. Or perhaps you travel to a certain state or country often enough that the system learns purchases there are likely to be legitimate.", "Citing a survey from Javelin Advisory Services, MasterCard estimates that $118 billion in sales were declined due to falsely identified fraud in the United States in 2014 \u2014 well more than the $9 billion lost to actual instances of fraud. That\u2019s a large sum of money that retailers \u2014 and credit card purveyors like MasterCard \u2014 could be pocketing.", "MasterCard\u2019s new Decision Intelligence software pulls in data, sometimes hundreds of pieces of data, about a specific transaction at the moment a customer swipes his or her credit card. The system then combines all of that information to yield a score indicating how likely the transaction is to be fraudulent. Each score builds on the one before it and informs the one after it such that the computer\u2019s algorithm gets better at detecting fraud without a programmer having to engineer every change. The company called it \"the first use of AI being implemented on a global scale directly on the MasterCard network.\"", "\"For this to work we need all kinds of data coming in,\" said Ajay Bhalla, the president of enterprise risk and security at MasterCard. \"We\u2019ve been working on a strategy of getting more data points into the network.", "\"We see this as a critical component of our future strategy,\" Bhalla added. \"We are embedding AI in everything we\u2019re looking at as a company.\"", "For the last decade, Visa has deployed its Visa Advanced Authorization system to detect fraud. The volume of data and the speed at which it\u2019s processed have increased considerably over that time, said Mark Nelsen, the company\u2019s senior vice president of risk products and business intelligence. Visa parses through those large sets of data to discern what characteristics distinguish legitimate and fraudulent spending, and then uses those characteristics to assess the veracity of future purchases.", "\"We can look at that transaction and, knowing what we\u2019ve seen in the past, we can predict if this is going to be good or bad,\" Nelsen said.", "Digital payment platforms are also embracing machine learning, though fraud remains more difficult to detect in online or mobile commerce. PayPal has developed its own artificial intelligence software to combat fraud, allowing the company to move from a system that can analyze tens of data points to one that can analyze thousands. \"There\u2019s a magnitude of difference \u2014 you\u2019ll be able to analyze a lot more information and identify patterns that are a lot more sophisticated,\" PayPal\u2019s senior director of global risk and data sciences, Hui Wang, told American Banker.", "But Visa, MasterCard and PayPal have the financial heft and risk appetite to explore artificial intelligence in ways that smaller and more regional players in the financial services industry do not, said Celent analyst Arin Ray. While most in the industry think AI holds promise, there remain questions about how it will impact regulatory compliance and that makes some hesitant to embrace the technology, according to a report Ray co-authored in August.", "\"The concept of AI has been there for 50 years, but it really has had a rebirth of sorts in the last three or four years. The volume of data has grown exponentially in recent times, so there is definitely the need for tools to [analyze it],\" Ray said in an interview.", "\"One [concern] is how this technology will impact their existing operations. Since it\u2019s still unproven technology, they don\u2019t want to take that risk if they have to make major changes to their existing infrastructure,\" he said."], "targetTitle": "How artificial intelligence could stop those awkward moments when your credit card is mistakenly declined", "targetDescription": "More financial services companies are embracing the technology.", "targetKeywords": "mastercard; visa; paypal; credit cards; fraud; credit card fraud; money fraud; credit card decline; artificial intelligence; artificial intelligence banks; financial services; banks; ", "targetMedia": null, "targetUrl": null, "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": null, "spoilerPublisher": null}, "spoiler": ["MasterCard\u2019s new Decision Intelligence software pulls in data, sometimes hundreds of pieces of data, about a specific transaction at the moment a customer swipes his or her credit card.

If you were particularly ambitious, or particularly in need of cash, you could make more money by working more hours, but on a per-hour basis, you\u2019d still be making about the same \u2014 a bit more than $22 per hour.", "Fast-forward to 2015, though, and the picture looks a lot different. The average man working a typical full-time job, 35 to 49 hours a week, now earns about $26 an hour. But the man working 50 hours a week or more now earns close to $33 an hour. Hourly pay has risen more than twice as fast over the past three decades for men working long hours, as employers increasingly reward employees willing to work extra hours with raises or promotions. (The pattern crosses educational and industry lines, and holds when excluding overtime pay.)", "Notice that I said \"men.\" Men make up a bit more than half the full-time workforce, but they account for more than 70 percent of those working 50 hours a week or more. So as wage gains have gone disproportionately to people working long hours, they have also gone disproportionately to men, widening the earnings divide between men and women overall.", "The gender wage gap has narrowed significantly over the past 50 years. In 1964, according to data from the Census Bureau, the typical woman working full time made about 59 cents on the dollar earned by a man; by 2004, that had risen to 77 cents. (These calculations don\u2019t take into account differences in experience, industry or other factors.) More recently, however, progress for women has nearly stalled out: In 2014, the latest data available, women earned 79 cents for every dollar earned by men, a 2-pennies-an-hour improvement over a decade.", "Other measures of women\u2019s progress in the workforce \u2014 their rate of employment, the likelihood that they will work in a historically male-dominated field, the rate at which they run big companies \u2014 show a similar pattern of what researchers Martha J. Bailey and Thomas A. DiPrete, in a new essay, call \"five decades of remarkable but slowing change\" for American women.", "Bailey and DiPrete\u2019s essay serves as the introduction to a remarkable new collection of papers from the Russell Sage Foundation that examines the progress that women have \u2014 and haven\u2019t \u2014 made over the past half-century. It isn\u2019t a simple story. The U.S. has already made major, albeit incomplete, progress on many of the most obvious causes of gender inequality \u2014 explicit discrimination on pay, overt barriers to employment, taboos against working while raising children. What is left is a tangle of cultural norms, implicit biases, individual preferences and other, subtler forms of discrimination that are much harder to change or even to measure.", "Take the long-hours anecdote I described above. The rapid rise in pay for people working long hours has played a major role in the persistence of the overall gender wage gap, particularly for parents; new research in the Russell Sage Foundation volume estimates that the wage gap between mothers and fathers would be 15 percent smaller if the extra-hours increase hadn\u2019t occurred. But that premium itself isn\u2019t the result of discrimination, explicit or implicit; women who work long hours have seen even faster gains than men (although they still earn less on average).", "Rather, the trend contributes to the wage gap because men are so much more likely than women to work those long hours. That, in turn, is the result of a confluence of factors that are deeply embedded in the American economy and society: Women, on average, spend much more time than men on housework, while men \u2014 especially a certain category of highly educated, elite men \u2014 are expected to work as much as possible. And of course, most importantly, mothers are still far more likely than fathers to be the primary caregiver for their children. Government policies could make a difference \u2014 affordable child care, for example, could make it easier for women who want to work long hours to do so \u2014 but they can only go so far.", "The Russell Sage Foundation papers are full of such thorny issues. A rising share of the gender wage gap is driven by \"pre-market\" factors such as choice of industry and occupation; those issues can also be the result of explicit or implicit discrimination but are much harder to address than wage differentials within a given job. And even forces that should help close the gap, such as education, have proved insufficient: Women have for decades been more likely to attend college than men \u2014 there are now for the first time more female than male college graduates \u2014 yet the pay gap is widest among the most educated workers. Girls now outperform boys in many science and math subjects in high school, but women are still much less likely than men to work in many of the most lucrative technical fields; women have actually lost ground to men in computer science in recent decades. And the overall rate of \"occupational desegregation\" \u2014 women entering traditionally male-dominated fields and vice versa \u2014 has slowed.", "There are some encouraging signs for women. Those who do go into science and technology fields earn nearly as much as equally experienced men (though that isn\u2019t true in computer science), suggesting the overall wage gap would narrow if more women entered so-called STEM fields. Moreover, the \"motherhood penalty\" \u2014 the relative decline in wages for women when they have children \u2014 has disappeared or even reversed for highly paid, highly educated women, perhaps because they are the most likely to have access to (and be able to afford) child care. That suggests that making child care more widely available could help narrow the gender pay gap for less-educated women, too \u2014 something that is looking more likely now that both major presidential candidates are advocating affordable-child-care plans. Culture is changing, too: Men are taking on a larger share of child-rearing responsibilities, though the division is still far from equal.", "Still, the overall picture painted by the Russell Sage Foundation research is one of slow, grinding and unsteady progress, and of barriers that are hard to define and even harder to resolve. Hillary Clinton may be poised to crack the ultimate glass ceiling, but true gender equality remains a long way off.", "The Olympic tax", "Speaking of high-earning (and high-flying) women, the internet was abuzz this week with stories about the hefty tax bill that gymnast Simone Biles and other Olympic medalists will face when they get back from Rio. The BBC estimated Biles will owe more than $40,000. A bipartisan bill to exempt Olympic winnings from taxes is gaining momentum in Congress.", "But the whole issue is getting blown out of proportion. The U.S. Olympics Committee awards bonuses to American medal winners: $25,000 for gold medals and smaller amounts for silver and bronze. Biles, with her five medals, will receive $110,000, which in theory could put her on the hook for more than $40,000 in taxes. (The medals themselves are also taxable, but their actual value is modest.) But it\u2019s unlikely she\u2019ll actually owe that much because Biles and other Olympians can deduct the cost of their training on their taxes. And in the case of high-profile Olympians such as Biles and swimmer Michael Phelps, their actual winnings are dwarfed by far more lucrative (and very much taxable) endorsement deals. By the time Biles cashes all those checks from Procter & Gamble, her Olympic tax bill will probably look like a rounding error.", "The Fed", "Newly released minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s July meeting this week suggest that Board Chair Janet Yellen and her colleagues are still weighing whether to raise interest rates in September or wait until the economy improves further. Separate comments from key Fed officials this week indicated that new data since the Fed\u2019s meeting hasn\u2019t resolved the question.", "The Fed is in a tricky spot. The job market continues to show strength; May\u2019s weak employment report looks more and more like a blip. But overall economic growth has been disappointing, and there have been recent signs that consumer spending \u2014 a key pillar of strength in recent months \u2014 is beginning to weaken. Then there is the election, which complicates the Fed\u2019s task in two ways: Policymakers don\u2019t want to intervene too close to the election, lest they appear to be trying to influence the outcome, and they also have to grapple with the possibility that the election itself, and the uncertainty around it, will affect the economy. Most economists still think the Fed will wait until after the election is over to raise rates.", "Number of the week", "Back in July, I wrote about the long-term decline in teen summer employment, particularly among lower-income youths. A report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics this week indicates the recovery is gradually reversing that decline: 53.2 percent of Americans ages 16 to 24 had jobs in July, up from 52.7 percent last year and 50.7 percent in 2013. The report didn\u2019t break out teens specifically, but a look at the underlying data shows that the employment rate for teens rose, too. Moreover, the employment gap between low-income and more affluent teens narrowed somewhat, the latest sign that the improving economy is gradually benefiting the most vulnerable workers."], "targetTitle": "Why Women Are No Longer Catching Up To Men On Pay", "targetDescription": "This is In Real Terms, a column analyzing the week in economic news.

So I did. I pulled into the gas station, and then my wife brought the kid to the bathroom, and he announced that he was bluffing. He did NOT have to take a shit. So he got back in the car, and we drove for another 30 minutes, and then he announced, for a second time, that he had to go poop.", "\"You\u2019re not lying this time, are you?\" I asked him. \"If you\u2019re lying, I\u2019ll never stop for you to poop again.\"", "But he said he had really had to go, so I pull over, and it\u2019s the same thing. He was either lying or he got stage fright in the McDonald\u2019s can. So my wife puts him back in the car, and we get stuck in traffic on the Beltway just as we\u2019re getting home.", "I think you know where this is going. Once again, the boy screamed out that he had to poop. I told him he could hold it until we got home. Then he started clutching at his tummy and crying out to pull over.", "\"I don\u2019t think he\u2019s lying this time,\" my wife said. But I swear to you, we were just a mile from home at that point. And the Beltway is one of those horrible roads that offers very little in the way of ideal places to pull over. Home was the only logical destination for him to go void his bowels. So I told him he had to hold on jussssst a minute longer. Begged him, really.", "Sponsored", "On the exit ramp, he suddenly stopped crying. And I knew why. I could hear him exhaling forcefully. Kids don\u2019t hide that sort of thing. We pulled into the driveway (not before hitting every light on the way there), and my wife rushed the boy into the house and into the bathroom. Green shit was CAKED on his legs. It was everywhere. Some of it fell out of his pants (how?) and landed on the front stoop. It was terrifying. Anyway, that\u2019s parenting in a nutshell for you. You take every precaution possible, and you still end up with green shit all over the place.", "Now, your letters:", "Dan:", "I don\u2019t know if this is a good question, because I doubt there\u2019s any kind of satisfying answer to it. But why do no NFL teams seem to care that Jameis Winston maybe raped a girl? The mock drafts all have him going at no. 1 or 2 (most say no. 1). How the fuck?! Especially in light of the year the NFL has just had (and Goodell\u2019s publicity push for an end to violence towards women), would it be that crazy to suggest that NFL teams won\u2019t want to risk spending their first-round pick on someone who many people believe has a capacity for actual evil? Even if he never raped anyone, he has shown he\u2019s a liability, at best, with the crab-legs thing and the \"fuck her right in the pussy\" thing. How are Bucky Brooks and Daniel Jeremiah not even hedging their bets at this stage? I\u2019m sure last year they talked ad fucking nauseum about Johnny Manziel\u2019s partying and how that would affect his draft stock. HOW DOES RAPE NOT??? Why aren\u2019t they even mentioning it?", "I think you\u2019re wildly overgeneralizing to say teams don\u2019t care. Of course they care. You\u2019d care if you were the GM who decided to risk his job by investing the no. 1 pick in a seafood thief and alleged rapist. But the Bucs desperately need a QB (or else everyone gets fired anyway), so they\u2019re probably best off drafting Winston and then throwing out a bunch of some bullshit spiel to Peter King about how they had private eyes talk to over 75 people about Winston in studying him for the draft. That strikes me as an obvious ass-covering move so they can draft Winston, and then, if he fucks up, they can be like, \"Don\u2019t blame us! We talked to 75 whole people about him!\" They just want to make sure he doesn\u2019t commit any FUTURE rapes. And if he does, they want to make sure that they can blame Winston and Winston alone for it.", "But it is strange that, in the public scouting process, Winston\u2019s past has been reduced to a handful of convenient euphemisms like \"immaturity\" and shit like that. Look at Lovie Smith gush about Winston, even though he can\u2019t possibly know him all that well:", "\"To me, I think he\u2019s told us an awful lot with how he\u2019s handled it,\" Smith said. \"It\u2019s not like he\u2019s getting ready to go into the NFL and scrutiny is coming his way. He\u2019s gone through it a couple years now, and he\u2019s answered the bell. That\u2019s what you have to do. You have to have tunnel vision and do your job. Looking from the outside, that\u2019s what he\u2019s been able to do.\"", "I mean, that\u2019s a hell of a way to twist a rape allegation into a positive. LOOK AT HIM SHAKE OFF DEFENDERS AND CIRCUIT COURT JUDGES WITH SUCH EASE! The fact that Winston was never formally charged with rape, and the fact that the NFL and their broadcast partners probably have a great many lawyers who would prefer that the word RAPE not be thrown around when addressing Winston, is all Smith needs to sell you on the IDEA of drafting him ... to concoct a narrative of an ambitious young man looking to redeem himself as a way of cleverly masking the fact that the Bucs have an urgent, raw football need to fill, and they have little choice but to fill it with a guy who might be the scum of the fucking Earth.", "That\u2019s why Winston\u2019s rape allegations haven\u2019t necessarily affected his draft stock the way Johnny Manziel\u2019s drinking did. It\u2019s because NFL teams think that Winston is simply a better player. If neither player had baggage going into the draft, Winston would be taken before Manziel every time. That\u2019s the reason the Browns are ready to give up on Manziel already. It\u2019s not the boozing. It\u2019s the fact that they don\u2019t think the little fucker can play. The NFL can chirp all they like about domestic violence and doing the right thing, but the bottom line is that the majority of their employees must win in order to keep their jobs, and that means they must place a bloodless premium on talent than the NFL would rather not acknowledge as still existing. They constantly want to sell you on character or on potential character instead. If Jameis is gonna go no. 1 no matter what, the NFL has no choice but to hold their noses and make it look like they didn\u2019t willingly crown a psychopath prince of the draft.", "You know what\u2019s funny about all this? Winston was AWFUL last season, and I\u2019m not talking about just his \"Yakety Sax\" play in the Rose Bowl. He threw 18 picks last season against horrible, piddly-shit ACC teams. But scouts, for some reason, seem to be far more impressed by the fact that Winston staged a number of winning comebacks that were necessitated almost exclusively because of his own boneheaded mistakes. If you look the part, and you\u2019ve got the arm, and you have that subjective mix of football IQ and magical QB unicorn leadership skills, scouts will happily overlook all those turnovers. And the rape stuff. It\u2019s quite something.", "(By the way, SUPERFUCK Jaws and Mike Mayock for their little \"Mariota\u2019s on top of my board now!\" spiel this week. Jaws is an empty-headed attention whore who will say basically anything. And the only reason certain football fans enjoy Mayock is because they haven\u2019t learned to be sick of him yet.)", "Kyle:", "Are BIG EGG and BIG NUTRITION teaming up to push the egg white agenda? You have to have roughly double the egg whites to get the same amount of food, thus causing an increase in egg consumption. I\u2019m suspicious of the whole thing.", "But the yolk has all the cholesterol! If you simply throw out the yolk, and then add bacon, ham, and cheese to your omelet, it can\u2019t hurt you at all! That\u2019s science.", "I used to be huge on egg whites. True story: In college, I would go to the dining hall, toast a bagel, grab a couple of hard-boiled eggs, remove the yolks, and then mush the whites onto the bagel and eat a sad egg-white bagel sandwich that way. I thought this was a healthy lunch, conveniently ignoring the whole \"eating a whole bagel\" part of the enterprise. Sometimes I ate two in one sitting. Do not do this.", "The truth is that egg whites are one of those foods you eat so that you can eat more food. I hate small portions, so if I eat a 12-pound egg-white omelet, I feel like I just got away with something. But in general, this is untrue. You need portion control in your life, which means you should just splurge and eat the goddamn yolk anyway. The yolk is the best part. All golden and runny and seeping into the toast nooks ... I could a 50-egg omelet. I swear. There are never enough eggs in the omelet for me. Why are eggs so small? I need eggs to be triple their current size. I don\u2019t like cracking so many of them. I am not a crackpot.", "Danny:", "If tomorrow, you could appoint any current non-politician in America as the POTUS for the next eight years, who do you think would do the best job?

Also, assume that anyone who you appointed would drop whatever else it was they were doing and accept their next eight years living in the White House.", "Well, look, it\u2019s not like politicians are somehow uniquely skilled anyway. Pretty much anyone can be a politician if some shadowy party operative hands them a bag of cash and is like, \"Bill Kristol says you have nice teeth.\" That\u2019s truly all you need to become a prominent politician in America at the present moment. They should probably make you take a test or something.", "That said, if I had to vote for one random famous person to be dropped into the Oval Office for the next eight years, I\u2019m picking Elon Musk. I need a VISIONARY, man. I want Musk to divert all defense spending into building a giant water slide from New York to L.A.

I won\u2019t hear it.", "I know it\u2019s lame to pick a captain of industry for that job, but I don\u2019t want a fucking actor. I don\u2019t want some comedian like Jon Stewart or Louis CK who would hate the job instantly.

I say fuck that.", "September is the most common birth month in the United States, which means that we Americans seem to prefer fucking in the winter, if only because there\u2019s nothing else to do. Personally, I prefer summer. I don\u2019t want to worry about having to cover up all the sexy business with a comforter because everyone in the bed is colder than shit in January. I want everything out in the open. I want to be hot and sweaty and horny and dying to rip off my sexy striped polo shirt just for YOU, baby. I want the covers off and the lights on and I want to see EVERYTHING. I need good material for when I\u2019m alone. Summer is sexier. TELL THEM, Y&T!", "HALFTIME!", "William:", "Would you rather have a dog that folds laundry, or a cat that does dishes?", "The dog, I guess. My preference for dogs over cats is greater than my hatred for doing dishes over folding laundry, so there you have it. Doing dishes blows, but folding laundry is also horrible. It\u2019s 8:30 p.m., and the kids are finally asleep ,and I\u2019m just about ready to settle into the recliner when I see that fucking laundry basket filled to the brim over in the corner, and it never ceases to make my blood boil. Fuck that laundry. I should only have to fold MY clothes. My clothes are big and sparse and easy to fold. My laundry is awesome. My wife should thank me for never wearing more than one pair of pants in a week.", "Corey:", "Let\u2019s say all members of the Beatles and N.W.A are magically revived and/or returned to their artistic primes. The Beatles then have to go into the studio and record an album of N.W.A\u2019s best hits, and vice versa. Which album ends up sounding better?", "The Beatles one, because the Beatles would just take the NWA lyrics and arrange some entirely new Beatles song around them, and it would probably be very pretty. As much as I like NWA, I don\u2019t wanna hear them butcher \"Blackbird.\" None of those guys could sing. When Diddy ripped off \"Every Breath You Take\" just so he could milk Biggie\u2019s death one more time, I wanted him to fall into a canyon.", "Also, I bet John Lennon would REALLY relish pretending to be an inner-city black man. He\u2019d be way too enthusiastic about it.", "Blake:", "How many albums a year could the top pop stars put out? Beyonce\u0301 could have the top 20 songwriters writing at all times, and the top producers and editors working year-round like Christmas elves. The masses never tire of pop music, so why not put out an album a month?", "Because that\u2019s too much product! Even the nuttiest white-girl Beyonce\u0301 fans would get sick of her if she put out 120 songs a year. You can\u2019t keep up with that kind of catalog. Those songs can\u2019t all be great. Even if they were, you\u2019d still grade them on a curve and have certain \"hits\" in your mind that would make your permanent rotation, with everything else falling by the wayside. That\u2019s easy to do now. Back in day, when I had to listen to tapes, I usually listened to all the songs on the album because I was too lazy to fast forward. I heard \"Back Off Bitch\" by GNR far more times than anyone should have to endure. Not their best work. I don\u2019t have to do that anymore. Technology has made me a supremely lazy music fan.", "It\u2019s just not possible to absorb that much music from one artist, no matter how hard you try. Ever have your favorite artist put out a double album? It\u2019s a complete pain in the ass. I need you to go away for a while so that I can grow to love you again. Whenever an artist says that they had 60 tracks to choose from or whatever for a single album, I can promise you that you NEVER want to hear the 50 tracks they threw away. Half of those tracks are just the guy freestyling on the bongos while high on acid.", "Kevin:", "So I\u2019m getting married in a month, and my fiance\u0301 and I are closing on a house next week. Instead of some over-the-top bachelor party, I am asking that my friends just help me move. My friends feel that this is selfish, and I\u2019m taking advantage of them. We\u2019re moving from a 1,000-square-foot apartment into a three-bedroom house. It\u2019s not like we have a ton of stuff. The plan was that I rent the truck, and we move everything Saturday morning, and then grill steaks and get drunk Saturday night in the new house. I think that this is way better than asking everyone to kick in hundreds of dollars to go golfing for a weekend or whatever; it\u2019s my bachelor party, and I should be able to do what I want, right?", "But that\u2019s not a party. You\u2019re asking for free manual labor instead. That doesn\u2019t count as a celebration, you monster. If I threw a party, and everyone came, and then I was like, \"Hey guys, this is a LAUNDRY FOLDING party! Now fold my laundry and I\u2019ll get takeout!\" all my friends would have me killed. You can\u2019t do that. If you want to ask your friends to help you move, that\u2019s fine. But you can\u2019t apply that to your party credit. Do the move yourself, and then have the bachelor-party cookout afterward, without putting any work obligations on your friends.", "Steve:", "This actually happened close to six years ago, but it remains a contentious issue amongst our group of friends. Five of us were on a road trip from Montreal to Boston, rotating drivers evenly as one does on longish road trips. As we got close to Boston, the friend driving the last leg got pulled over for speeding. Since we were in college at the time, the $200+ ticket was nothing to sneeze at. (Who are we kidding? It\u2019s still a lot of damn money.) The issue was \u2014 does the ticket get split amongst the group, or paid solely by the driver? The four of us who drove first say no, since we drove our portion without incident. The friend who got slapped with the bill argues that since the last leg was the toughest, and we were trying to get to our destination by a certain time, and nobody complained about his speed until the blue and whites started flashing, that we should split the ticket. Who is right?", "The last leg was the toughest? Why? Were there dragons lining the highway? Your friend was driving, and thus he\u2019s responsible for his own driving behavior, even if he had shit luck. He pays the ticket. If another friend riding in the car wants to pitch in, fine. But that guy shouldn\u2019t EXPECT it. These kids today never want to take responsibility SMDH!", "I went to a basketball game last week, and I had an Uber take me home, only the Uber guy got a parking ticket outside the arena while he was waiting for me. And I felt bad that he got the ticket, so when the ride ended, I gave him $20 in cash extra. And that, of course, made me feel all generous and kind. YES AMERICA, I helped pay a full one-tenth of that poor bastard\u2019s ticket while exploiting regulation loopholes that force working-class people to act as private chauffeurs to uppity white dipshits with smartphones. MEDAL OF HONOR FOR ME, PLEEEEEEEZ.", "But screw your friend.", "Tom:", "Where would the most opportune time/place for aliens to land to get the biggest initial audience, but not get shot out of the sky? The White House lawn would be a great spot, but they would have several fighter jets shooting at them before they land; a random field would have no one around. I feel the best bet is a major sporting event that doesn\u2019t have dedicated aerial security. What do you think?", "All major sporting events have (in theory) patrolled airspace. I would just vote for the Sheep Meadow in Central Park, dead center of Manhattan. News crews could get there quickly. Crowds would form. Roasted-nut vendors would make a KILLING. And New Yorkers would instantly try to take ownership of the First Contact experience. \"You guys don\u2019t get these aliens. IT\u2019S A NEW YORK THING.\"", "Actually, now that I think about it, let\u2019s choose any large park space in any other city. Because Central Park is a complete fucking pain in the ass. It\u2019s hot and overcrowded, and there\u2019s horseshit everywhere. If aliens landed there, four million people would converge on the spot, and then I wouldn\u2019t be able to get a good view, and the subways would be jammed, and I would just say FUCK IT and then go home and watch the aliens on TV instead.", "Mike:", "How does Robocop poop? He has that weird baby food he has to eat to keep his organic parts alive, so he must have to release it somehow.", "Actually, if you look at the original uniform design, the posterior covering is soft and potentially removable. It\u2019s not welded metal. Robocop could, in theory, remove a posterior assflap to do his business, even if no standard toilet could possibly bear the weight of a three-ton cyborg sitting down to shit in it. My guess is that instead of straight defecation, Robocop has an internal waste-management system that processes his urine and stool, and then either a) recycles it for some other practical use (poop gun), or b) can be discreetly disposed of, like through a leg dispenser. That\u2019s what I would do if I were designing the perfect 21st-century scumbag-killing machine. RoboCop has no time for poop.", "Aaron:", "What happened if it came out that President Obama had a Twitter account under a different name and was trolling conservatives and his critics completely anonymously?

How long would the media blow that up for? What would his Twitter handle be? Would he put a picture and bio, or just keep the egg there like a weirdo?", "There are calls for Obama\u2019s impeachment and resignation on a daily basis right now, so I assume a @Luther account would only amplify those daily complaints. \"More like Marco Boob-io, AMIRITE?!\" That tweet would probably help fill up a news cycle or two before everyone stopped giving a shit. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d actually resign, though. After all, plenty of politicians out there already use Twitter for trolling purposes. And we live in age where you can survive pretty much any scandal so long as you\u2019re willing to sit there and ride it out. You let 200 million people take a dump on your face for a week, nod politely, and then everything is back to normal.", "I do think he\u2019d have a picture and bio for his troll account, tho.

Assume the team hasn\u2019t officially announced the pick. Does the NFL let the team withdraw the pick? I remember when the Vikings had to pass on a pick because they didn\u2019t get their card in on time, so I could absolutely see some team arguing the pick wasn\u2019t official until the card is turned in and read. I hope this happens to some team like the Cowboys, and Jerry sends someone onstage to tackle Goodell before he reaches the podium.", "I might be wrong, but I think once you turn the card in, the pick is final.

(Courtesy Ashok Goel)", "To help with his class this spring, a Georgia Tech professor hired Jill Watson, a teaching assistant unlike any other in the world. Throughout the semester, she answered questions online for students, relieving the professor\u2019s overworked teaching staff.", "But, in fact, Jill Watson was an artificial intelligence bot.", "Ashok Goel, a computer science professor, did not reveal Watson\u2019s true identity to students until after they\u2019d turned in their final exams.", "Students were amazed. \"I feel like I am part of history because of Jill and this class!\" wrote one in the class\u2019s online forum. \"Just when I wanted to nominate Jill Watson as an outstanding TA in the CIOS survey!\" said another.", "Now Goel is forming a business to bring the chatbot to the wider world of education. While he doesn\u2019t foresee the chatbot replacing teaching assistants or professors, he expects the chatbot\u2019s question-answering abilities to be an invaluable asset for massive online open courses, where students often drop out and generally don\u2019t receive the chance to engage with a human instructor. With more human-like interaction, Goel expects online learning could become more appealing to students and lead to better educational outcomes.", "\"To me this is a grand challenge,\" Goel said. \"Education is such a huge priority for the entire human race.\"", "At the start of this semester Goel provided his students with a list of nine teaching assistants, including Jill, the automated question and answering service Goel developed with the help of some of his students and IBM.", "Goel and his teaching assistants receive more than 10,000 questions a semester from students on the course\u2019s online forum. Sometimes the same questions are asked again and again. Last spring he began to wonder if he could automate the burden of answering so many repetitive questions.", "As Goel looked for a technology that could help, he settled on IBM Watson, which he had used for several other projects. Watson, an artificial intelligence system, was designed to answer questions, so it seemed like a strong fit.", "To train the system to answer questions correctly, Goel fed it forum posts from the class\u2019s previous semesters. This gave Jill an extensive background in common questions and how they should be answered.", "Goel tested the system privately for months, having his teaching assistants examine whether Jill\u2019s answers were correct. Initially the system struggled with similar questions such as \"Where can I find assignment two?\" and \"When is assignment two due?\" Goel tweaked the software, adding more layers of decision-making to it. Eventually Jill reached the point where its answers were good enough.", "\"I cannot create chaos in my classroom. Jill had to be almost perfect as a human TA or I am,\" Goel said.", "The system is only allowed to answer questions if it calculates that it is 97 percent or more confident in its answer. Goel found that was the threshold at which he could guarantee the system was accurate.", "There are many questions Jill can\u2019t handle. Those questions were reserved for human teaching assistants.", "Goel plans to use Jill again in a class this fall, but will likely change its name so students have the challenge of guessing which

He knows exactly what he's doing,\" over and over. Although the beleaguered Rubio campaign was quick to call it another Bush dirty trick, the Marco Robotos were animated by operatives from Democratic Super PAC American Bridge.

Nobody said that,\" he said. \"People just got here early,\" he explained, pointing out that the campaign was offering free muffins, berries, and juice.", "Not everyone\u2014especially the hundreds who'd received the campaign's invitation for an 8:30 pancake breakfast\u2014was satisfied. \"It's the Marco Rubio pancake breakfast\u2014so far we've had no pancakes and no Marco Rubio,\" joked Bob Durant, a Rhode Island lawyer who was political touring with his family and friends. \"You wonder is it really because you have so many people,\" that things are delayed, Bob asked, or is it because, after the debate, \"He has to re-write his entire speech, since Chris Christie ripped it up?\"", "His wife, Meg, was watching it all with more of an insider's eye. The Michigan state director for the Bush/Quayle 1992 campaign, Meg Durant looks for the little things to tell her how a campaign is doing. After Saturday's Republican debate, she grabbed a couple of Christie and Bush signs for her kids.

He's still going to abolish the federal Department of Education, but he's decided to offer Tom Brady \"a cabinet position.

Barack Obama is the first president, at least in my lifetime, that wants to change the country. ... Not fix its problems; he wants to make it a different kind of country.\"", "Things perked up a little bit when Rubio agreed to answer a few questions, calling on innocuous-looking white haired fellow in a bright flannel shirt. Identifying himself as Capt. Dan, a 65-year-old retired charter boat operator and a Rubio constituent from Florida, he wondered what a President Rubio would do about the climate change flooding that's putting his house in Miami Beach underwater. \"I'm going to get my money out of it and move to higher ground,\" Capt. Dan explained, who added that he doesn't expect to live forever. Isn't there something Rubio can do about climate change \"for the young people?\"", "Rubio has a script for this question. Climate change legislation hurts the economy. It hurts the economy and has no real impact on the environment. The better approach is to support innovators of American energy. \"I say, 'OK, if we pass this bill how many feet of sea rise will it prevent?'\" he explained, reasonably, as he has on this and many other occasions. \"'Well, it won't prevent any sea rise.' OK, well how many degrees of temperature will it avoid going up?' Well, it won't do that either.\"", "But afterwards, Capt. Dan professed to be happy with Rubio's response. \"Last time I heard him say it,\" which just happened to be in Manchester two days ago, \"he said it was too expensive, too difficult, wait.\" This time \"he started to look to the side a little bit, see a different way to see it.\" Possibly so. Reframing climate change as a family issue, not an environmental one, could certainly cause Rubio some cognitive dissonance. Very possibly that could be the conscious intent of folksy Capt. Dan, who traveled all the way to New Hampshire because \"this is such an intimate state where I have access to all the candidates....where I can ask the questions I want to ask.\" Folksy Capt.

In communities across the country, members of the military, members of government, and military families gather on both holidays to raise and lower flags, decorate graves, and participate in processions and parades. On Memorial Day, some people observe the national one-minute Moment of Remembrance at 3 p.m., which was passed into law by Congress in 2000. Observation of the Moment is left up to participating organizations, such as Amtrak and Major League Baseball. And, as in the U.K. and Canada, the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) distributes poppies on Veterans Day and Memorial Day so that people can publicly commemorate the fallen. The numbers don\u2019t lie, though: according to the VFW, only 9 million poppies will be distributed in the U.S. (population: 316 million) this year. By comparison, 45 million poppies will be distributed in the U.K. (population: 64 million) for Armistice Day, according to The Royal British Legion. Why doesn\u2019t the United States have a common culture of commemoration? One potential explanation lies in the fact that the U.S. hasn\u2019t recently experienced the kind of generational destruction that, say, the First and Second World Wars brought to Britain and Russia, respectively. Britain lost approximately 2 percent of its population in the Great War, resulting in a \"lost generation.\" Jay Winter of Yale University told me that those men \"left behind ... a void, an absence, a black hole in the center of thousands of families defined in part by who wasn\u2019t there.\" The Soviet Union suffered an even more dramatic loss in the Second World War\u2014amounting to roughly 15 percent of its population. By comparison, U.S. losses in the Second World War constituted about 0.3 percent of the population, and 0.1 percent in the First World War. The only American war that incurred such steep losses was the Civil War, in which 2 percent of the population perished. It should come as no surprise, then, that the trauma of that conflict led to the establishment of Decoration Day, the precursor of Memorial Day.", "Differences in how military holidays are observed can\u2019t be reduced to a numbers game, though. In the United States, at least, they may also stem from a strain of American thinking that highlights historical triumphs and skips over what those triumphs have cost. Lindsey Tepe of the New America Foundation, for instance, has written about the ways in which public education has become a battleground between those who view American history as \"a sweeping tale filled with ... grand heroes, epic battles, and the continuing struggle for the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\" and those who recognize that \"American history is also full of inconvenient truths ... and the injustices perpetrated throughout the course of building this nation.\" Winter argues that \"what makes U.S. commemoration different is the emphasis on redemption in American narratives of war.\" In the U.K., on the other hand, \"the absence of the Lost Generation mattered more.\" When America\u2019s national mythology and political discourse preach a tale of endless victory and exceptionalism, there is less of an incentive to focus on those men and women who didn\u2019t come home from battle. \"What makes U.S. commemoration different is the emphasis on redemption in its narratives of war.\" The finer details make a difference as well. Joe Davis, director of public affairs at the VFW, believes the All-Volunteer Force, established in 1973, drove a wedge between the military community and an ever-growing civilian population. During the Second World War, the United States fielded a conscription-based military of approximately 16 million people, out of a population of 135 million. Today, the professional military is well below its troop level during World War II, and the U.S. population has more than doubled in the interim. Davis also cited as a factor the shifting of Memorial Day from its original, fixed date of May 30 to the last Monday of May. \"When you link a military holiday to a three-day weekend, you lose the meaning of the day,\" Davis told me. Whatever the explanation, the lack of an appropriate occasion to commemorate America\u2019s war casualties has been noted. From 1989 until his passing in 2012, Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, a World War II veteran, repeatedly introduced resolutions to return Memorial Day to its traditional date\u2014and, by proxy, its original intent. Separately, two bills have been introduced in Congress in the last two years alone\u2014one to establish two minutes of silence on Veterans Day, the other to do the same on Memorial Day. Neither bill has been passed, although the one for Veterans Day has since been revised as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act. The timing of these bills is opportune. Judging by recent polls, the American public is war-weary and largely of the view that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were failures. A debate is also underway about what America\u2019s global role should be, with many Americans leaning toward isolationism (despite a surge of support for a more muscular U.S. foreign policy following ISIS\u2019s beheading of American journalists). In this environment, it would be worthwhile to rigorously observe a moment in which Americans collectively acknowledge the good that their country has done in the world\u2014and the real, human costs that have accompanied that involvement."], "targetTitle": "Is There a Better Way to Observe Veterans Day?", "targetDescription": "Other countries offer models for truly nationwide tributes to military service and sacrifice.", "targetKeywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "targetMedia": ["http://atlanticmedia.122.2o7.net/b/ss/atlanticprod/1/H.23.6--NS/0", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6463921&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1407501962855831&ev=NoScript", "http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-906344h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/11/RTR4DOTE/lead_large.jpg", "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/11/RTR4DOTE/lead_large.jpg?1430150302", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-b0K-eQJGBXxXE.gif", "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2013/11/veteranlarge/a682ac40a.jpg", "http://atlanticmedia.122.2o7.net/b/ss/atlanticprod/1/H.22--NS/0", "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/authors/d/edward-delman/headshot/headshot.jpg?1431456352"], "targetUrl": "http://theatln.tc/1qCr2IQ", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "Yes.", "spoilerPublisher": "SavedYouAClick"}, "spoiler": ["Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, a World War II veteran, repeatedly introduced resolutions to return Memorial Day to its traditional date\u2014and, by proxy, its original intent"], "spoilerPositions": [[[1, 2198], [1, 2370]]], "tags": ["passage"], "predicted_labels": 0}

Using data from leading publishers, we will dispel the myths and demonstrate that there are no universal \"best times\" to share content on Facebook.", "We analyzed the median traffic that articles received from Facebook three hours after they were shared. Using the median for all stories and a year\u2019s worth of data helped ensure the analysis wasn\u2019t skewed by outliers.

Could it be that readers in France all consume content more consistently throughout the day than the South Americans? Can there be specific guides per country?", "We compared traffic data from that same French news publisher with a top-10 French sports publisher of similar size and found that while before 10am they achieved similar results, the curves then diverge. By early afternoon, the news publisher is enjoying a strong peak in traffic, whilst the sports publisher is in a pronounced trough.", "Overall, the sports publisher\u2019s traffic is more consistent, with fewer dramatic peaks and troughs, while the news publisher has clearly demarked periods when more readers are clicking through to their stories. Even for two publications of equivalent size working in the same country, there are stark differences in audience behavior depending on the subject matter of the content.", "We also compared two similar publications in the same country and looked at the traffic profiles of two top-10 French news publishers. There were still crucial differences \u2014 when one publisher experienced a peak in share performance at 11am, it is in fact one of the worst times for the other publisher to be sharing.", "Interestingly, there also seems to be significant variance based on article topic. We looked at 220,000 Facebook posts made by our publisher clients between March 20 and July 10, 2016, and sorted them according to the time of day at which they were shared. We then compared performance of posts based on whether the articles were about sports or technology. All shares were obtained using local time, in order to compensate for time zone differences, then normalized by average client performance and volume.", "Again, there are important differences, and these nuances help us understand the characteristics of audiences and their varying appetite for particular content types at different times of the day.", "But even these descriptions of the individual publishers do not do the subtlety of the data justice.

Two legendary horror actors, Vincent Prince and Bela Lugosi, each outpace Bean by at least 10 movies.", "But the top honor of most on-screen deaths goes to wonderful character actor John Hurt. With over 120 movies, Hurt\u2019s death percentage is similar to Bean\u2019s \u2014 around 30% \u2014 but just seeing the list of Hurt\u2019s 43* deaths is impressive.", "He has died in The Wild and the Willing, Sinful Davey, A Man for All Seasons, 10 Rillington Place, The Ghoul East of Elephant Rock, Spectre, Alien, The Elephant Man, Heaven\u2019s Gate, The Osterman Weekend, The Hit, After Darkness, The Black Cauldron, Jake Speed, Spaceballs, Aria, Deadline, Little Sweetheart, Scandal, L\u2019Oeil qui ment, Monolith, Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, Contact, The Climb, All the Little Animals, You\u2019re Dead, Lost Souls, Hellboy, Pride, Tabloid, The Proposition, V for Vendetta, Outlander, Boxes, An Englishman in New York, Ultramarines, Whistle and I\u2019ll Come To You, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Only Lovers Left Alive, Snowpiercer, Hercules, and finally the TV miniseries I, Claudius.", "Maybe it should be #DontKillJohnHurt.", "So is Sean Bean a walking spoiler alert? For that we could compare deaths per film to standardize among the actors. If we do that, Sean Bean is still at the top of the list with 0.32 deaths/film, tied with Bela Lugosi, and followed closely by Mickey Rourke and John Hurt with 0.31 deaths/film. Vincent Price and Cary Tagawa are next with 0.28 deaths/film, and it decreases from there. (For the curious: South Park\u2018s Kenny barely beats Bean with 0.38 deaths/episode.)", "Of course, Bean has indeed racked up a large number of deaths early on in his career, relatively speaking (he has made far fewer films compared to Lugosi, Price, and Hurt).

Our hunt led us to the lovely, Christian businesspeople at Ivory & Deene. Impressed by the ornate lighting fixtures and reasonable prices, we decided to contact the management to see if we could negotiate a discounted price, as our theater company is a nonprofit with a very limited budget. What did we have to lose? We thought that the worst thing they could say was \"no,\" but it turns out that that's not the worst thing they could say. Here's what they did say to our producer Will:", "We are sorry we will not support your production because we are Christians and we believe the first marriage God instigated was between and [sic] man and a woman and when he created them he said \"very good\", not just \"good\" like He did with the rest of creation, but \"very good\".

Kind regards, Ruby", "Punctuation, spelling, and grammar aside, Ruby obviously intended to make an example of us by denying us an item that surely only a homosexual would dream of purchasing anyway. (If you saw the chandelier, you'd understand.) She seemed intent on reaffirming her archaic and unfounded belief system by misquoting the Bible. (God did not say \"very good\" when he created man and woman. Look it up.) And rather than simply declining our request, as so many companies we have sought sponsorship from have, Ruby decided to do the least Christian thing she could think of: directly and personally judge and shame strangers. She may not have called us \"faggots,\" but she might as well have.", "I worry about Ruby. She seems to be oblivious to the fact that a great deal of her clientele are most likely queer. I mean, come on. Girl is selling amazing satin sheets. Whether she knows it or not, Ruby is singlehandedly contributing to the decoration of bedrooms where abominations unimaginable occur. We're screwing on your sheet sets, Ruby. And in a way, a little part of you is screwing right along with us. Just thought you'd like to know. You're gay by association. Find a shower. Quick.", "The truth is, Ruby can't be nai\u0308ve enough to think that she has never sold a product to a gay person. But the anonymity of the marketplace and the exchange of money for goods is all it takes for Ruby and Ivory & Deene to turn their heads the other way. Only when directly presented with the truth do they suddenly take issue.", "Perhaps we'll directly and anonymously purchase the chandelier from Ruby and hang it proudly on our set.

Eyebrows were raised because Pacquiao had already declared his dedication for public service even prior to his win during the national elections.", "So what was the truth?", "The 37-year old boxer unretired for another fight.", "Manny Pacquiao announced his retirement, which lasted for 3 months, after his unanimous win against Timothy Bradley.", "Pacquiao did not deny his eagerness to come back to his career of 21 years which made him a household name and a worldwide recognized boxer when he rose in eight divisions.", "After the game which gave Mahindra a 105-103 win against the defending champion of the Governors\u2019 Cup, the San Miguel Beermen, he confessed to a horde of journalists his aspiration to add another win under his belt. According to him, boxing helped him provide for his family and he does not want to consider his job as a senator as his livelihood.", "With Las Vegas in mind as the venue, Arum set the date of his fight on November 5. Instead of the usual camp in Hollywood with Freddie Roach, the senator\u2019s camp will be in the Philippines in order for him to still be able to fulfill his duties as a politician.", "Pacquiao was elected twice as the congressman of Sarangani before he ran for Senate. His 4 days of attendance in Congress became controversial.", "It was in May 2015 after his loss against Floyd Mayweather Jr. when news of his retirement floated around.

A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Vanderbilt University Medical Center found that getting a flu shot reduced the risk of flu-related hospitalization by 71.4 percent for all adults and 76.8 percent for those over age 50 during the 2011-2012 flu season.", "The CDC estimates deaths associated with the flu number between 3,000 and 49,000 people each year.", "One reason people don't get vaccinated is cost.

Insurance won't necessarily cover shots at retail pharmacies.", "Employers can help bring down those costs - and likely save themselves money as well.

It's too early to know how this year's will compare or even how many people have come down with the flu so far this autumn since those numbers, tracked by the CDC, weren't reported during the recent government shutdown.", "Flu activity usually peaks in the United States in January or February. Recent studies from the European Union show the vaccine offers less immunity and has a shorter duration than previously thought, according to Kris Ehresmann, director of the infectious disease division at the Minnesota Department of Health. \"But now is the time to get vaccinated,\" she adds.", "What's new this year, says Dr. Michael Jhung, medical officer at the CDC, is that many flu shots will immunize against four strains of the flu virus for the first time, an improved protection over years past. Drug companies plan to make 135 million to 139 million doses of vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration.", "Several vaccination options are available. They include: a standard dose for adults and children, a high-dose shot for people over age 65, a nasal spray for those who don't like needles, and a dose that is egg-free for patients who are allergic.", "Everyone over the age of 6 months should get one, experts say. \"We don't prefer one vaccine over another,\" Jhung says. \"Whatever vaccine patients choose, we're happy.\"", "The elderly, children under age 5, pregnant women, and people with other chronic health conditions are most vulnerable to the flu.", "Getting immunized earlier guarantees protection whenever the flu season starts in earnest, Jhung notes. Plus, adults who don't get vaccinated can put others, including children, at risk. Only 42 percent of Americans got vaccinated in the 2011-2012 flu season, the latest data available from the CDC.", "As an added bonus, a new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that up to 36 percent of those vaccinated reduced their risk of heart attack, stroke, or other cardiovascular health problems just by getting a flu shot. Based on these findings, the researchers calculated that one death or serious illness due to heart trouble could be prevented by vaccinating 58 additional people.", "Peter Delgado, a 66-year-old self-employed accountant, recently left a Cambridge, Massachusetts, Rite Aid before getting his flu shot. \"There was too much paperwork to fill out, and they wanted to charge me $70,\" says Delgado, who lives nearby.

That means even Vin Diesel -- who, thanks to the \"Fast and Furious\" movies, stars in one of the most popular film franchises in existence -- had to independently finance the third \"Riddick\" movie. How did he get here?", "Let's start with \"The Chronicles of Riddick,\" the sequel to \"Pitch Black,\" which was released on June 11, 2004. The film, which cost around $110 million, grossed just $57 million at the North American box office, making it one of that summer's costly misfires. After that result it was understandable that a studio -- in this case, Universal -- was leery about putting more money into the franchise, even at this new film's reported bargain budgetary cost of $38 million.", "Maybe, though, that was for the best. In this new installment, we find Riddick (Diesel) left for dead on a desolate planet. After a lengthy recuperation segment, the focus of the film shifts to a group of bounty hunters who are on the planet searching for Riddick. So, Riddick, the character, shifts from our hero to, as \"Riddick\" director David Twohy calls him, \"the bogey man.\" It's something Twohy, who also directed the previous two installments, says would never have happened had this been a straightforward studio movie.", "Did you ever think this third movie would ever happen after \"The Chronicles of Riddick\" underperformed?", "Yeah, I had my doubts after the second one. And we suffered some slings and arrows. According to the studio, we spent way too much money and didn't make enough back. So, that's never a good formula. So, I had my doubts. If you speak with Vin, I'm thinking he would say, \"Never a doubt that we were going to do a third movie\" -- because that's just the kind of guy he is. He is a big dreamer. I'm more the pragmatist of the duo.", "Vin Diesel has had quite the resurgence over the last couple of years.", "Look, I've learned never to count Vin Diesel out. Just don't do that. And I guess it's because he is a very smart guy. Smarter than people give him credit for.", "I enjoyed that in \"Riddick\" the stakes are big to the characters, but not compared to all of the big summer movies we just saw. These people basically just need to leave a planet and that's it.", "And look, I've been in those meetings, too. Where it's, \"We have to up the stakes. We have to give it a ticking clock\" ... So, I hope that \"Riddick,\" if nothing else, feels a little more handmade than factory-made. That's what I set out to do and Vin was certainly along for that ride, too.", "The first half hour, we're pretty much alone with Riddick. Then the film focuses on the bounty hunters and Riddick becomes almost the bad guy, even though we spent the first part of the movie with him.", "That's right. Now, that's something the studio would have fret out about. \"Wait a second. You are totally sympathetic with Riddick while he's trying to survive, but then you're using him as the bogey man.\"", "Why did you want to do that?", "Because he is both those things. He is a man. He is a survivor -- a survivor with skills. And enough personal code that he can be sympathetic to us, but, at the same time, never let the audience forget that he's a stone cold killer. But, you know I think it works. Because I have to introduce those new characters ... I have like 10 new characters to establish. And I can bolster Riddick's roar -- his legend -- by having them talk about him as they glimpse him.", "Do you think the success of the \"Fast and Furious\" movies helped to get \"Riddick\" made?", "Yes. But, here's the cyclical nature of the business. Because \"Pitch Black\" did well, that allowed him to be part of the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise. And guess what? What goes around, comes around. So, on the basis of that, he was dropped into a major part in \"The Fast and the Furious.\" And based on the success of that, yes, that does impact on our ability to launch this third one. Even though Universal didn't want to make it at a certain point. In fact, they didn't make it. Do you know that story?", "I do not.", "It goes like this. After \"Chronicles,\" they said, \"We are out of the Riddick business. It's just a straight business calculation of us. You spent too much money and you didn't make enough back. So, no, we're not going to do anymore.\" Vin, being the savvy guy he is, said, \"Well, give me the rights back.\" And they didn't want to do that ... I think this was about the time that \"Fast 3\" had already shot and they were testing it. Maybe it wasn't testing as well as it should have and they decide, \"Maybe we need a cameo from Vin\" -- because he wasn't in that movie. So, I do believe that in his savviness, Vin said, \"Don't pay me for that cameo. Just give me the rights back.\" So, his company basically controls the rights and because I control all of the sequels and remakes. So, we can't make a movie without each other, nor would we want to. So, that's how he got the rights back and I think that was a great business move.", "So, ultimately, we did it as an independent movie. I wrote a spec script. We sold it in Berlin for international. We came back into town looking for a domestic partner. I thought it was going to be Sony or Film District -- they were both eager to have the movie. And then, guess what? Universal raises their hand, \"Well, what about us?\" And I said, \"This doesn't feel right to me\" But Vin, he was saying, \"That was then, this is now\" ... So with the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise and his relationship with Universal over that and the strength of those, we placed it again at Universal. So, the company that kicked us to the curb [laughs] picked up the movie and will be distributing it in the U.S. and Canada.", "So Universal didn't put any money into the film?", "They put money into it for their domestic distribution rights.", "So Riddick is an indie film?", "Here's an example of how it's an indie film. I wrote a spec script, we sold that. We went up to Montreal and I think I did one polish on my original script -- and then we shot that. Then, when it comes to editing, I got to the point when I wanted to show it to 50 people in a room, just to see what they understood: What was clear to them and what was not clear to them. Because of things aren't clear to them, the audience can't enjoy it and I still have time to go to the editing room and clean it up. I didn't have it scored and didn't fill out forms, I just stood in front of them and asked them questions ... I had the studio heads in once, but we were basically locked at that point.

The reports indicate that at least half of his staff will be laid off in the wake of Clinton\u2019s victories in New Jersey and California, though some of them might be offered jobs in Sanders\u2019 Senate office.", "A lot of the staff members who are being laid off are advance staff who often help with the logistics of setting up a campaign, but a lot of the field staff, who often handle phone calls and door to door campaigning, are being laid off as well.", "The reports of the layoff came after Clinton\u2019s victory on Tuesday where she won the majority of delegates in California and New Jersey. It is important to note that despite Clinton\u2019s strong lead, she does not have enough pledged delegates to earn the nomination. She currently has 2,184 compared to Sanders 1,804. There are 158 pledged delegates still available and 2,383 are needed to win the nomination.", "Clinton, who has been declared the party\u2019s nominee by many in the media, such as the AP, does have the support of more than 500 super delegates, which is what puts her over the top. Super delegates are party officials who can support either candidate. The super delegates will not vote until the Democratic National Convention, which will be held the last week of July.", "Despite the layoffs, Sanders is not ending his campaign and is hoping to be able to sway the super delegates to his side. Sanders will argue that he is the strongest candidate to face Donald Trump in November. It is an argument that Sanders has made throughout this primary season and it\u2019s one that the poll numbers back up. The majority of polls have Sanders defeating Trump by a larger margin than Clinton does.

Here\u2019s Why."], "postPlatform": "reddit", "targetParagraphs": ["STRANGE BUT TRUE", "Why the Republican frontrunner just might be able to build on his success with Latino voters in Nevada\u2014and win the White House as a result.", "We know about the Reagan Democrats. In the 1980s, union members in blue states defied their leaders in organized labor to vote for the 40th president.", "Well, in Nevada, the first of the early primary or caucus states with a significant number of Latino voters, we\u2019ve caught a glimpse of a similar phenomenon\u2014one that few could have imagined when Donald Trump entered the race for the Republican presidential nomination.", "You may recall that the billionaire businessman launched his foray into politics eight months ago with a speech that declared that Mexican immigrants were \"bringing drugs\" and \"bringing crime,\" and that they were \"rapists,\" criminals and murderers even though, he assumed, \"some are good people.\" Now, it seems, some of those good people are enamored of their tormentor.", "Behold, the Trump Latinos.", "According to CNN entrance polls, among Latino Republican voters in the Silver State, John Kasich got 4 percent, Ted Cruz 18 percent, and Marco Rubio 29 percent. Trump got an astounding 44 percent.", "I can only think of two people who don\u2019t seem surprised by Trump\u2019s strong showing with Latinos.", "The first is Trump himself, who has been saying for months that he would do well with Hispanics. In fact, Trump would often point to early polling from Nevada that showed him beating his rivals decisively with Hispanics, which is what happened.", "Trump has a theory. He thinks that Hispanics know that he will create jobs and that many of these jobs will go to Hispanics because his years in business have taught him that Hispanics are especially hard workers.", "The other person who saw this coming was me. Two weeks ago, I wrote a piece for this site that looked at the phenomenon of \"Latinos for Trump.\" That piece was criticized by everyone from white Democrats to Latino activists to Republicans supported other candidates.", "Now, if you look at the entrance polls out of Nevada, it seems clear that these critics don\u2019t know much about Latinos.", "Granted, these surveys are not the definitive final word. This was a small sample of voters, and many polling experts doubt the accuracy of entrance polls. Besides, we are talking about just Latino Republicans who went to vote on a given day in the state of Nevada. That\u2019s hardly a representative sample of Latinos across the country.", "And, finally, it is worth noting, most Latinos weren\u2019t even on the table for Republicans in Nevada because more than two-thirds of the community are registered Democrats. In fact, if Trump is ultimately the Republican nominee, it will almost assure a Latino landslide for Hillary Clinton, who could walk away with as much as 80 percent of the Latino vote.", "Still, all those caveats and conditions don\u2019t change what happened in Nevada, or its significance. We need to unpack that.", "But first, let me explain a few things about my tribe. The 54 million Latinos in the United States\u2014whose ancestors can be traced to more than a dozen countries\u2014could yield an estimated 13 million voters in November. And many of those voters will be in three battleground states\u2014Nevada, Colorado, and Florida.", "Next, there is no suspense as to which party will scoop up the lion\u2019s share of those votes. It\u2019s the same party that has won the majority of Latino votes in every presidential election since 1960: The Democratic Party. No Republican presidential candidate has ever won the majority of Latino votes.", "Finally, while many in Washington will often try to compare Latinos with African-Americans as another aggrieved minority that has endured everything from inferior schools to overt discrimination to economic inequality, there is a competing line of thought that suggests Latinos are more comparable to other Catholic immigrant groups, like the Irish and Italians.", "Like their European immigrant brethren, Latinos want to come to their ethnicity on their own terms. They are fiercely patriotic Americans who nonetheless identify as Latino. And they don\u2019t feel as if they must choose one over the other.", "That is relevant to this discussion because, as one reader put it to me recently: \"If these voters think like Americans, they\u2019ll vote for Trump. If they think like Latinos, they won\u2019t.\"", "Now, here\u2019s what happened in Nevada. The Latino community in the United States\u2014and especially the nearly 70 percent of that population that is Mexican or Mexican-American\u2014is highly aspirational. They don\u2019t settle. They want better lives for themselves and their children. They want success. They don\u2019t hate Trump. They want to be Trump.", "In states like Nevada, Colorado, Texas, Utah, and others, far away from the nation\u2019s power triangle (New York-Boston-Washington), there were many average Latinos living ordinary lives who are being drawn to Trump and his promise to \"Make America Great Again.\" Like many other Americans who are flocking to the real estate mogul, these Latinos want to know what it\u2019s like to live in a country that is always winning and winning.", "And what about Trump\u2019s inflammatory comments about Mexico and immigration along our southern border?", "It\u2019s complicated. While generally more appreciative than other Americans of immigration, respectful of the contributions of legal and illegal immigrants, and supportive of a comprehensive reform plan that provides the undocumented with a path to earned legal status, many Latinos are also ambivalent about illegal immigration\u2014especially if they, or their ancestors, came legally.", "They\u2019re leery of immigrants who abuse the system and feel entitled to make demands of the country that took them in, while waving the flag of the country that cast them adrift. They\u2019re also fed up with what they see as a new militancy among the undocumented immigrants of today\u2014particularly young DREAM\u2019ers who were brought here as children and seem to understand everything about this country except what it demands of its citizens and those who aspire to be citizens.", "Like Trump, these Latino voters know something is wrong with the nation\u2019s immigration system. They might not agree with his proposed solutions, but they\u2019re not going to hold against him the fact that he\u2019s brave enough to start the discussion. Besides, when Trump blasts Mexican immigrants as criminals, many Latinos just assume he\u2019s talking about someone else.", "Meanwhile, we shouldn\u2019t be terribly surprised that the chattering class completely missed the \"Latinos for Trump\" story. Much of it fell into their blind spot.", "The East Coast media don\u2019t get Latinos. Neither do the political parties. Ditto for most commentators, pundits, and political strategists. In fact, just about everyone with an opinion has the wrong opinion about Latinos.", "For instance, they all seem to think that Latinos are demanding from government and other institutions that they be siphoned off into their own separate group and showered with preferential treatment and special accommodations. Not true.", "Latinos don\u2019t want to apart from America, and they aren\u2019t in conflict with America.

The album also features a direct Kanye-Jesus comparison in the song \"I Am A God\": \"I know he the most high / But I am a close high.\"", "With Kanye bringing a Jesus lookalike on stage during his current tour, The Huffington Post decided now is a good time to compare the relative places of Kanye and Jesus in the popular zeitgeist.", "To do this, we analyzed a year's worth of Twitter data (from Oct. 21, 2012 to Oct. 20, 2013) via the third-party service Topsy. When comparing Jesus and Kanye on Twitter, the first question is what terms should we use for the comparison?", "There are a lot terms Twitter users use to reference Jesus: there's the broad \"Jesus,\" which includes other people named Jesus, the more specific \"Jesus Christ\" and foreign language versions -- Jesucristo in Spanish, gesu\u0300 cristo in Italian. Some users also tag the name, resulting in mentions for @Jesus.", "There are a lot fewer version of \"Kanye.\" \"Kanye,\" which includes other people named Kanye (though there are far less people named Kanye than Jesus), \"Kanye West\" and @kanyewest. (There are also nominal instances of people tweeting his nicknames, like Yeezy and 'Ye.)", "Since Jesus doesn't have a genuine Twitter account, and Kanye has a habit of deleting all of his tweets, using @ mentions didn't seem that promising or fair. Looking to minimize instances of other people named Jesus and Kanye, we decided to start our search comparing \"Kanye West\" with \"Jesus Christ\":", "According to the data, in the last year worldwide, looking at only original Tweets (no retweets, no replies), \"Jesus Christ\" had 3,936,585 mentions, while \"Kanye West\" had 4,541,349 mentions. Pretty impressive for the 36-year-old rapper.", "While West's total was greater overall, on a typical day, Kanye didn't have more tweets than Jesus. Kanye's numbers were skewed by a few high mention days and his median tweets/day (9,981) were, in fact, lower than Jesus's median tweets/day (10,458). In fact, Jesus had more tweets on the majority of days (187 out of the 365 days in the year).", "So, using \"Kanye West\" vs \"Jesus Christ,\" their Twitter mentions are pretty close.", "But what about the foreign language tweets? Kanye has an advantage with foreign language tweets, because countries with the Latin derived alphabets, as far as we know, refer to Kanye West as Kanye West while, as mentioned above, there are many different ways to reference Jesus.", "Only looking at the United States offers a clearer picture. Although there are some residents in the U.S. who speak foreign languages, Jesus Christ is generally used as the identifier. Here, again using \"Kanye West\" vs \"Jesus Christ,\" Kanye had slightly more mentions overall, 2,429,931 to 2,224,895, but they were about equal when the day-to-day totals received consideration. Breaking it down state-by-state, some states tweeted more about Jesus (orange states) while other states tweeted more about Kanye (green states).", "When did users tweet the most about Jesus and Kanye?", "Kanye West's top five days:", "1) 8/26/2013, 90,993 tweets. The day after his \"Blood on the Leaves\" performance at the VMAs", "2) 12/31/2012, 70,701 tweets. New Years Eve. Kim Kardashian announces she's pregnant with West's baby.", "3) 9/27/2013, 58,608 tweets. West feuds with Kimmel on Twitter and gets in a confrontation with paparazzi.", "4) 6/18/2013, 51,012 tweets. The official release of his album \"Yeezus.\"", "5) 6/21/2013, 48192. The announcement of his baby's name: North West.", "Jesus Christ's top five days:", "1) 12/25/2012, 37,459 tweets: Christmas.", "2) 5/9/2013, 36,393 tweets: Ascension Thursday", "3) 3/31/2013, 35,955 tweets: Easter Sunday", "4) 3/29/2013, 29,576 tweets: Good Friday", "5) 4/23/2013, 26,921 tweets: St. George's Day", "Jesus Christ's biggest day-of-the-week was Sunday, while Kanye's biggest day-of-the-week was Monday.", "When you look at the stream of \"Jesus Christ\" tweets, you will quickly notice a complication: a large amount of the \"Jesus Christ\" tweets are idiomatic (\"I just stubbed my toe. Jesus Christ! #notblessed\") and don't actually refer to the literal Jesus Christ. Usage of the exclamatory \"Jesus Christ\" is probably more popular among those who are at least exposed to Christianity, so it may still be a good signal for Jesus's popularity among the Twitterati. That being said, the idiomatic Jesus Christ doesn't directly refer to the person Jesus Christ, while Kanye West refers to the person Kanye in almost all cases, so if we're looking for an apples-to-apples comparison, then Jesus Christ's numbers are significantly smaller.", "How much smaller? We looked at a sample of the hundred most recent tweets for \"Jesus Christ\" on Twitter using the Twitter search and found that 73 percent of uses of \"Jesus Christ\" were idiomatic, leaving 27 percent literal. This search occurred during a tense soccer match (lots of \"Jesus Christ\" exclamations) and is too small of a sample to offer definitive conclusions, but it signals that the idiomatic \"Jesus Christ\" is accounting for a significant portion of the examined mentions.", "So what happens if you compare \"Jesus\" vs \"Kanye\"? Jesus had significantly more tweets: Kanye had 10,412,097 tweets compared to Jesus's 51,724,902 tweets. Looking again at a sample of the hundred latest tweets to gauge what's going on, we see the following breakdown:", "Idiomatic: 22%", "Literal: 70%", "Other Person's Name: 8%", "This sample is again too small to prove definitive, but even if only 25 percent of those tweets that contain the word Jesus refer to the religious figure, \"Jesus\" would still have more literal tweets than \"Kanye,\" and the proportion of tweets referring to Jesus appears to be much higher than that. We also haven't accounted for different names for Jesus in languages other than English. When you break it down by region, mentions of \"Jesus\" are more popular than \"Kanye\" pretty much everywhere.", "So, it looks like Jesus is \"the most high\" on Twitter -- except for Justin Bieber, who trumps Jesus in popularity with 68,257,710 tweets for the search term \"Bieber\" during the same period."], "targetTitle": "Is 'Kanye West' More Popular Than 'Jesus Christ'?", "targetDescription": "Kanye West has used Jesus Christ in his art since \"Jesus Walks.\" Never, thou...", "targetKeywords": "kanye west yeezus tour,kanye west yeezus,twitter,Kanye West,Jesus Christ,yeezus,topsy", "targetMedia": ["http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/kanyejesusmosthigh_1.jpg", "http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/Logo_HuffingtonPost-1f66cbef067771f8508930828f764bc8bf8c4b027e58e14e07d207a9f0ce1d31.svg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "http://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/221717/slide_221717_3826322_free.jpg", "http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/callout_highlight_icon-930f97b89eddc7188ad1c1e0a96bc1359e94a46ea21239c3c5ca3f25c543eaeb.gif", "http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/kanyejesus6-1.jpg", "http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/snapchat-QR-56da75d622f38e76ff0d3dec97344808f972f51020435d37d55c6f0e2eaec780.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-703240h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/oimg?key=0AozQZhVO6XiydDVnZG02T0FoTUxheWpDMlRaQWp4N3c&oid=1&zx=et9vnjz6b5ie", "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1439506/images/o-KANYE-WEST-facebook.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "targetUrl": "http://huff.to/1aOFRT8", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "Twitter depending on metric used", "spoilerPublisher": "HuffPoSpoilers"}, "spoiler": ["original Tweets"], "spoilerPositions": [[[6, 67], [6, 82]]], "tags": ["phrase"], "predicted_labels": 0}

He went on to be a part of Britain's National Diving Squad for 12 years, and even represented England at the 1990 Commonwealth Games.", "Eventually he was picked up by an agency called Sports Promotions which specialised in sports modelling, before he became a model for French Connection.", "All of that, grouped with his many action roles, most of which he performs his own stunts for, have required him to stay in great shape. But how's he maintained it for all of these years?", "Statham ripped as fuck in Death Race. Credit: Universal Pictures", "Well, the 49-year-old, who has studied Wing Chun, kung fu, karate, and kickboxing, applies himself to a strict diet, as well as a strict workout regime. And by strict, I mean fucking strict; this is Jason Statham we're talking about, he's a no nonsense kind of bloke.", "Statham only eats 'good food', saying 95% of what he eats is clean - the other 5% being small treats every now and again. He also swears by cutting out all the sugars and heavy starch in the afternoon. If you eat carbs later in the day, it's harder to work off - if needs be, have them in the morning and your daily activities should work off the calories.", "In an interview with Men's Health, the star revealed that for breakfast he goes for either granola, fresh fruits and oats, porridge, or poached eggs.", "For lunch, he says in the interview to broaden your horizons, but fair warning, it's not going to sound too appealing.", "\"I'm certainly no vegan, but there's this little place down on Sunset that I'll go to, the California Vegan, and they do a really good steamed vegetable and brown rice,\" he said. \"You put that in your body and you feel good. Or try a nice miso soup. There's nothing better than that stuff.\"", "He goes on to say that the latest you should ever have your evening meal is 7pm, and it should be high in protein. He specifies chicken, fish and lean beef, accompanied by vegetables or salad. The icing on the cake, as well, is to drink a minimum of three litres of water a day; he has knocked fruit juices, full of added sugar and fructose on the head, as well as alcohol.", "So, unfortunately, you're not going to get as stacked as The Transporter star while chugging lagers every other day of the week, and then ending the night with a sweaty kebab.", "Jason's workout plan is a different kettle of fish.

Therefore, it is vital to a successful plan to record all lifts and times so that intensities can be calculated.\"", "Whatever workout he chooses to do, he will do a five to 10 minute general warm-up, which will be him using an elliptical machine (cross fit trainer), or something else that works the whole body.", "He told BodyBuilding.com that following this warm-up, he does another 10 minutes of medium intensity exercises. This will include the likes of front squats, dead-lifts, exercises carrying kettle bells, sandbags or dumbbells, a variety of explosive medicine ball exercises, and circuit training.", "The Snatch star has a specific non-iron circuit training regime, too, which requires no equipment. He told Men's Health that he picks five exercises from exploding push-ups, squat thrust, burpees, sit-ups or crunches, step-ups, tuck jumps, squat jumps, star jumps or pull-ups, and does 10 reps of each. Anyone else out of breath just thinking about this?", "Statham's high intensity boxing workout begins with shadow boxing, working the back and shoulder, with lunges and some quad, groin, and hamstring stretching in between to work the legs.", "He then moves onto five three minute rounds on the pads, and once that is completed, steps it up to three, three minute rounds on a heavy bag. The workout is then finished off with three rounds on the speed bag and a warm down.", "For a weight based high intensity workout, Statham's trainer will choose a combination of six exercises, set a required rep range for each individual exercise, and then repeat five times.", "The time taken to complete the five circuits is recorded, and is how the level of intensity is measured. The times are then turned into targets so they can be used to increase the intensity of the workout as fitness levels increase.", "Of the exercises, BodyBuilding.com says they include barbell front raises, dumbbell burpees, farmer's walk, pull-ups, bear crawl sled drag, close-grip pull downs, front squats, hanging knee raises, weighted step ups, and one-arm cable rows.", "No wonder he's fucking jacked.", "Words by Mark McGowan"], "targetTitle": "How Jason Statham Has Managed To Stay Ripped All These Years", "targetDescription": "The actor turns 49 today.", "targetKeywords": null, "targetMedia": ["http://20.theladbiblegroup.com/s3/content/353x199/0bd05e2257d6beb8f2679f601975928b.jpg", "http://www.theladbible.com/assets/images/instagram.svg", "http://www.theladbible.com/assets/images/vine-logo.svg", "http://20.theladbiblegroup.com/s3/content/491x276/477318d85797b246990e79ef3a24df8c.png", "http://20.theladbiblegroup.com/s3/content/f16c01d05797b7ecec5989a98093bb69.png", "http://20.theladbiblegroup.com/s3/content/353x199/4542b7875797e1f467e753f19c6ab6e6.jpg", "http://20.theladbiblegroup.com/s3/content/353x199/e4bb4be557978989990e183e5f1f8a44.jpg", "http://www.theladbible.com/assets/images/snapchat.svg", "http://20.theladbiblegroup.com/s3/content/353x199/68a114a357d60f196cb18b88d01b2341.jpg", "http://20.theladbiblegroup.com/s3/content/353x199/4e58d1485797d24e93bd3e192d4c26d6.jpg", "http://20.theladbiblegroup.com/s3/content/353x199/7f0474a257d5989d74dd48410aabb28b.jpg", "http://www.theladbible.com/assets/images/theme/logo.svg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=jzgkj1aAkN00Ej", "http://20.theladbiblegroup.com/s3/content/353x199/409f8d1457975234990ecf8591cc625d.jpg"], "targetUrl": "http://www.theladbible.com/entertainment/celebrity-how-jason-statham-has-managed-to-stay-ripped-all-these-years-20160726", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "Exercise and a good diet", "spoilerPublisher": "savedyouaclick"}, "spoiler": ["strict diet, as well as a strict workout regime"], "spoilerPositions": [[[10, 104], [10, 151]]], "tags": ["passage"], "predicted_labels": 0}

They say we\u2019re living difficult times, that people are curious and they want to know more, but people also aren\u2019t dumb.", "Juan Gabriel then went on to criticize television for trying to delve into something that shouldn\u2019t be of interest to anyone.", "\"I think, today, television is asking too many loaded questions, pushing further for the ratings,\" he told the journalist. \"I\u2019ve learned during my life that if I am in hell, I make my own glory.

What I say is what I feel, whether anyone likes it or not. But there\u2019s something else I have to say as a human being, and that\u2019s that you only get one life and you have to live it, and if we have to eventually pass to a better life then it has be an honest one.

One of her secret savings accounts had grown to $900 behind her back.", "Rhoads, a 37-year-old Los Angeles-based sales director for a jewelry line, has an account with Digit, a financial technology company with an algorithm that tracks users\u2019 income and spending patterns. It painlessly spirits small amounts of money out of checking and into a savings account every two or three days. ", "\"I just thought it was such a good idea, to set it and forget it,\" said Rhoads, who says she is \"like a squirrel\" in her approach to saving. Digit sends texts with balance updates, which she largely ignores because \"I like to pretend the saving is not happening.\" ", "Getting consumers comfortable with putting their finances on customized autopilot, starting with a simple, no-fee\u2014and no-interest\u2014savings account, is the San Francisco startup\u2019s mission. In two years, its users have saved more than $350 million this way, according to its 31-year-old founder and chief executive officer, Ethan Bloch. When the product moved out of pilot mode, in February 2015, users were saving about $1 million a month; now that\u2019s more than $35 million a month. Digit won\u2019t disclose the size of its user base but says it has tripled from about a year ago.", "Digit had a savings bot before bots were cool, or at least before the hype in the financial technology world reached a fever pitch. Its product is simple. An algorithm looks at a user\u2019s average, high, and low checking account balance, when the user is paid, and whether the pay cycle is smooth or choppy. Then, after looking for bills due in the next week or two and analyzing recent spending, it moves an amount it judges the customer won\u2019t miss to a savings account. The company makes money from the interest rate it gets on account assets.", "Digit announced today that it will be the first savings bot on Facebook Messenger\u2019s platform, so users can just use Facebook to communicate with it. When Digit moved out of its pilot phase, it communicated only by text, a natural language for many users, since 17 percent of them are aged 21 to 24, and 44 percent are from 25 to 34 years old. Rhoads said they\u2019re \"cute texts\" with \"some personality\" and \"not annoying at all.\" After text messaging came iOS and Android apps for users.", "The company is now working on what Bloch called \"the first artificial intelligence-powered financial goal program.\" Users would set a date and amount (and pick an emoji, of course), and Digit\u2019s algorithm would make a series of projections based on balances to determine the optimal amount needed to start saving toward that goal\u2014or point out that the goal is unrealistic.", "Also on the product horizon is having Digit\u2019s algorithm figure out how to \"move every dollar where it should go, at the right time, to minimize fees [on student loans, credit card  accounts, etc.] and maximize gain,\" Bloch said. ", "There are hitches. Since Digit isn\u2019t a bank, it can\u2019t pay interest, and it will be competing in an environment of rising rates. Bloch said interest rates \"are not a huge deal\" for his customers, because they regularly withdraw money and tend to save small sums.", "Another hurdle is that traditional bank technology can make it hard to connect accounts. \"Banks have not made it easy for customers to get their data,\" Bloch said. \"Because of that, Digit and products like Acorns, Venmo, Betterment\u2014every day we have bank difficulties that affect thousands of customers.\"", "Behavioral finance underlies much of Digit\u2019s design. Take the goal function, for example: If users get more specific about what they are saving for, research suggests, they are less likely to withdraw the money.", "\"If an account is labeled 'Charlie\u2019s Education Fund,' I\u2019ll think harder about withdrawing it than if it\u2019s just labeled 'Savings,'\" Bloch said. Currently, 70 percent of Digit users withdraw 80 percent of their savings every 90 days, mainly to pay bills and meet short-term needs for cash, to pay off debt, or pay for travel.", "Bloch's broadest long-term goal is to make Digit\u2019s user interface far more conversational, to \"humanize it\" so users feel more in control when they communicate with it.", "\"We want to make Digit understand more\u2014not as broad as Alexa or Siri, but widen the aperture a little more\u2014related to finances and your money,\" he said. \"One day, it would be awesome to say, \u2018Hey, Digit, am I OK for retirement?\u2019 And all Digit does is send back a thumbs-up emoji.\"", "That kind of complex analysis won\u2019t show up anytime soon. But after a Series B round of fundraising led by venture capital firm Ribbit Capital, Digit\u2019s 22-person team is sitting on $25 million in cash. That, Bloch said, will let the company \"be somewhat protected for the next few years in pushing the envelope, largely to invest in product development. The big question for us now is, what more will our customers trust Digit to do?\" (Updates amount of monthly savings of digit users and total amount of savings.)", "(Updates amount of monthly savings of digit users and total amount of savings.)"], "targetTitle": "A Siri for Your Finances?

With the potential chaos of a new president on the horizon, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation passed a bipartisan bill giving NASA $19.5 billion to continue working on a mission to Mars. It also includes support for the continuation of the program to send astronauts on private rockets to the International Space Station (ISS) from American soil no later than 2018.", "\"We have seen in the past the importance of stability and predictability in NASA and space exploration \u2013 that whenever one has a change in administration, we have seen the chaos that can be caused by the cancellation of major programs,\" Republican Senator Ted Cruz, lead sponsor of the bill, \"We have seen in the past the importance of stability and predictability in NASA and space exploration \u2013 that whenever one has a change in administration, we have seen the chaos that can be caused by the cancellation of major programs,\" Republican Senator Ted Cruz, lead sponsor of the bill, commented . \"The impact in terms of jobs lost, the impact in terms of money wasted has been significant.\"", "The NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2016 includes an overall authorization level of $19.508 billion for fiscal year 2017, but it still needs to be passed by the Senate as a whole, of course. The budget allotted is the same as what was approved by House appropriators and a bit more than the version released by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Obama administration, likewise, proposed $19 billion in funding for NASA.", "Credits: NASA", "Making it rain, NASA-style", "The Senate is not giving NASA money just for the sake of exploration. It is also a challenge, a mandate, actually. The bill requires that NASA make it an official goal to send crewed missions to Mars in the next 25 years.", "The bill allocates funds for different components: $4.5 billion on exploration, nearly $5 billion for space operations, and $5.4 billion for science. It also does not scrap The bill allocates funds for different components: $4.5 billion on exploration, nearly $5 billion for space operations, and $5.4 billion for science. It also does not scrap NASA\u2019s controversial plans to send men on asteroids and collect samples by 2021. It does, however, require the space agency to regularly send progress reports to Congress, justifying its $1.4 billion cost.", "\"Fifty-five years after President Kennedy challenged the nation to put a man on the moon, the Senate is challenging NASA to put humans on Mars. The priorities that we\u2019ve laid out for NASA in this bill mark the beginning of a new era of American spaceflight,\" said an optimistic Florida Sen.

Here's how she's investing in 2017:"], "postPlatform": "Twitter", "targetParagraphs": ["In 2016, JP Livingston celebrated her 28th birthday. She also retired. Last month, I spoke with her about how she was able to retire, despite the fact that she only graduated from college about seven years ago. JP (a pen name she goes by on her blog, TheMoneyHabit.org) was able to retire because of her high earnings, lofty savings goals and disciplined investment techniques. Her investment strategies are part of what allowed her to build a net worth of about $2.25 million. ", "With less than a week left in the year, so many of us are setting goals for the new year, which includes figuring out an investment plan for 2017. Deciding on investment strategies or goals can help us figure out what we want our long-term financial picture to look like, and shape our budget for the coming year. When laying out an investing plan, who better to learn from than a woman whose investments boast high returns, and who retired before 30? In our Q&A, JP discusses her personal 2017 investment plan, and provides useful insights for investors looking to build their nest egg more aggressively. This interview has been edited for brevity.", "Maya Kachroo-Levine: You've had investments of over $1 million yield a 13% return ($130,000) in just one year. Can you speak to your investment strategy that year, and can you walk us through your 2016 investment strategy?", "JP Livingston: My investment strategy for several years has been a twist on a broadly discussed strategy to go long on equities.", "Many financial experts (those who aren't compensated for getting you to invest a certain way) will tell you that if you are young and in the wealth accumulation phase of your life, to consider parking your money in a low-cost index fund, for example, Vanguard's Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX).", "There are a few key arguments for this strategy. First, it's a nice hedge against inflation because the companies in the index are presumably raising their prices with inflation; since companies are valued on a multiple of revenue or profit, this will be captured in the growth of the stock market.", "Secondly, and most importantly, is that it's hard to argue with its results. The compound annual growth rate for stocks on the S&P Index for the last 30 years has been 11%. There are very few if any opportunities available to us regular individual investors that can top that kind of return for the risk. (Note: you'll get an entirely different view from hedge funds or mutual funds. They believe they can beat market returns and so they charge high fees for their time and efforts. A few of them are worth it. Most of them are not).", "Kachroo-Levine: What are you planning on changing about your strategy in 2017?", "Livingston: As a retiree, steady cash flow is going to matter more to me than it has in the past. There are only two ways to make money: appreciation and income. Stocks, for example, are about appreciation you make very little money on a regular basis (usually a puny 1%-2% in dividends), but a year or two or three later, you can sell it for much more than you paid and pocket the difference. A heavily appreciation-based strategy, like going 100% into index funds, will no longer meet my needs.", "Income-based strategies, by contrast, put a steady paycheck in the spotlight. Bonds are generally purchased for the interest they provide. Sure they can appreciate or depreciate in value, but the bulk of your return from a bond comes from the monthly or quarterly dividend it pays.", "I have a few years to build myself an income-based strategy, as I still have some deferred compensation coming from my old employer, but I'm looking to add one or two rental properties to my portfolio in 2017. Interest rates are still fairly low so it's not a bad time to be a borrower. I would also look at adding more bonds to my portfolio (specifically leveraged municipal bond funds; the leverage juices returns and municipal bonds are tax exempt), but I do not want to buy bonds right now, as the Fed has signaled a plan to increase interest rates (and even raised them just a week ago).", "Kachroo-Levine: What are your financial/investment goals for 2017? What are your priorities?", "Livingston: As I am newly retired, my main priority is transitioning my portfolio into more income-based opportunities that can provide steady money to cover my expenses each year. I'm on the lookout for a rental property or two to take advantage of low interest rates and which will provide some much-needed steady income. In some parts of the country like San Francisco, rental properties are actually negative cash flow exercises and are predicated on appreciation. In some areas, it will throw off 6%-7% or more in income each year and fit my income needs. Real estate is hyperlocal like that.", "Kachroo-Levine: What are the key philosophies that help shape your investment strategy?", "Livingston: I feel I've gotten pretty far on just two things.First, don't be afraid to say you don't know.", "People get really weird and insecure when it comes to money. We're all lifelong learners. I have to admit I don't know basic things all the time. For example, while I've read quite a bit about real estate investment, I'm constantly finding myself with a giant question mark as I apply those concepts to my first live investments. My priority though is to make money and learn, not to impress people.", "Second: Don't give up until you really feel you understand something.  Finally, my other silver bullet question is to ask What are the arguments against it? or What are the three things that could break this strategy? There's no free lunch. Every strategy has some vulnerability.", "Kachroo-Levine: What advice can you offer for novice investors in 2017? Specifically, if you were speaking to people who had never invested beyond a 401(k) or IRA, what would you say to them?", "Livingston: You are in such an exciting place, because there is low-hanging fruit all around you. A few things:", "1. Money management is an incremental game, not a winner-take-all game. That means every tweak you make has a noticeable impact on your money, and it means you don't have to choose between going whole hog or absolute zero. You can devote however much time and effort you have and get proportional results and new ideas to employ.", "2. Momentum matters most. Start by joining a few interesting communities and blogs and read a little bit a few times a week. Cruise around on the Reddit Personal Finance forum. Investment is only painful or boring when you try to cram too much too fast, or you go find a dry, educational source and force feed yourself the information.", "Momentum is the most important piece when you start any new project. Too many people think Alright, it's time to do this investment stuff and go and buy some highly rated book on Amazon to start their education. That's such a self-defeating way to start. Is that how you got into skiing, or guitar or interpretive Celtic dance? Has that kind of textbook strategy ever succeeded in firing up your passion?", "Kachroo-Levine: For those seeking early retirement, can you share why your investments are so crucial to your early retirement journey?", "Livingston: Your nest egg is like an entire extra employee doing work for you, an employee that gets better and stronger and eventually eclipses you.", "Say you make $100,000 pre-tax and save $30,000 a year. Once your nest egg is three times your salary, or $300,000, at a 10% return it will generate as much as you slaving a whole year to put away has accomplished.", "At 10-times your salary and a 10% return, it is throwing off more money than you make in an entire year. You could be sitting on the beach drinking Mai Tais and still see a year's worth of salary come in just from your investments. Of course, you can't guarantee consistent 10% returns, but you have a long-term bet that you can achieve during your accumulation phase by investing in low-cost index funds.", "More on Forbes: "], "targetTitle": "How A 28-Year-Old Who Retired With A $2 Million Net Worth Is Investing In 2017", "targetDescription": "Check out exactly what her investing strategy looks like.", "targetKeywords": "", "targetMedia": null, "targetUrl": null, "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": null, "spoilerPublisher": null}, "spoiler": ["transitioning my portfolio into more income-based opportunities that can provide steady money to cover my expenses each year"], "spoilerPositions": [[[12, 55], [12, 179]]], "tags": ["passage"], "predicted_labels": 1}

In short, you could likely replicate the experiment with any other vegetable.

K. Rowling. How did it work having three writers in the mix?", "John Tiffany Jo Rowling was incredibly generous. I met her first, and I already had a soft spot for her because she used to write in the cafe of the Traverse Theater in Edinburgh when I was the director. It was only after the first book came out that I realized it had been her, nursing one cappuccino for four hours. When we met to talk about the play, she asked, \"What do you think the Harry Potter stories are about?\" I said, \"Learning to deal with death and grief.\" There was something in her eye \u2014 I thought, we didn\u2019t say it\u2019s about transformation or magic or flying on brooms, and we\u2019re on the right track.", "Thorne We all met in Edinburgh and as the day developed, we knew we would take the epilogue of \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" as a starting point.", "Tiffany All the seeds are there; we start with that scene in the train station. Am I allowed to say that? Anyway, it was clear that she was going to let us take those characters and have our own ideas.", "Callender Of course, Jack came to the table with an encyclopedic knowledge of Harry, so that helped.", "Thorne All right, I\u2019m a nerd. With abandonment issues.", "Did you really sketch out the whole arc of the story in that first meeting?", "Thorne Yes, but then it took about six months to really map the whole thing out. Every time it was like taking a big step forward, one or two small ones back. Jo would say, \"This feels right, this doesn\u2019t.\"", "Tiffany There are parts of the story, which when we first conceived them, I didn\u2019t think she would let us do, but she never hesitated. It is one thing to let us continue the story, another to let us unravel the canon.", "Friedman That\u2019s enough!", "Was the idea of a two-part play there from the beginning?", "Tiffany No, not at all. But we knew we had to deal with going beyond where the books left off, but also go back and look at the stories within them. We wanted to develop the characters that are already known and keep that consistency, but also introduce new ones. It was clearly hard to put an epic tale into two-and-a-half hours. We had a meeting and said, \"Why not two parts?\" And we knew right away how we wanted to end the first part. It\u2019s a cliffhanger.", "Noma Dumezweni It does that wonderful thing that books do when they work; it makes you desperate for more story.", "How is it different telling that story as a play rather than a novel?", "Thorne We can tell the story of the younger and older generation at the same time, which the books didn\u2019t do. The exciting thing has been working out how those worlds fit together. It\u2019s a coming-of-age story as much for the adults as for the children. John and I are more or less the same age as Harry in the play and I just had my first child, so there has been a lot of discussion about growing up, being a parent.", "Tiffany How do you mother or father when you still need parenting yourself?", "Dumezweni Also, I think the difference with a play is that you\u2019re not experiencing the story on your own the way you do with a book.

They quit smoking using hypnotherapy. Celebrities have discovered the effective results of hypnotherapy and have used it to conquer their own smoking habits.", "Researchers at the University of Iowa combined more than 600 studies of smoking cessation programs involving 72,000 people from North America and Europe1. Hypnosis was found to be over 3 times more effective than nicotine replacement therapy and 15 times more effective than quitting cold turkey.", "A comparison study of smoking cessation treatments was conducted by North Shore Medical Center and Massachusetts General Hospital2. 26 weeks after discharge, 50% of patients who received hypnotherapy exclusively were non-smokers compared to the 25% of patients who didn't and only 16% of patients who used nicotine replacement therapy alone.", "Types of Addiction", "Smoking addiction is a combination of two types of addiction. There's the physical addiction, then there is the mental, or psychological addiction. Although nicotine addiction is considered one of the strongest addictions, even more addictive than cocaine, the good news is that the physical side of things doesn't last very long. In fact, some believe that you will lose the physical cravings for nicotine in as little as 3 days.", "The real struggle for smokers is overcoming the mental addiction. The smoker has essentially trained their subconscious mind to make smoking an \u0093automatic\u0094 behavior. These are the habits and rituals that a smoker has developed over the years such as smoking when they wake up, just before they go to sleep, after they eat, when they drive, when they drink coffee or alcohol, and so on.", "How Hypnotherapy Helps You Quit", "So what will hypnotherapy do? Rather than just treating the physical urges that are part of your smoking habit, hypnotherapy targets the subconscious drive behind the addiction, and breaks the positive associations with cigarettes that the mind has formed. This is replaced by an empowering, smoke-free perspective the hypnotist offers through verbal suggestions that deem smoking as something undesirable \u0096 or unnecessary \u0096 to do. Gradually, these suggestions take hold and diminish the smoker's impulse to smoke. Furthermore, hypnotherapy is considered to be a far more safe and natural method to quit smoking with and is non-habit forming. This cannot be said about most of the stop smoking aids we currently have on the market.", "But going to a hypnotist can be expensive. As much as $200 per one hour session, and requiring as many as 5 sessions for the entire treatment. If you're a celebrity like the ones mentioned earlier, then this isn't a problem. But can the average smoker afford to go to a hypnotherapist? Well, that question is left to the individual, but consider that a pack a day smoker will spend in excess of $2000 a year on cigarettes, not even including the increased cost of life and health insurance, and doesn't include the drastic cut in your ability to earn."], "targetTitle": "What is the easiest way to quit smoking?", "targetDescription": null, "targetKeywords": null, "targetMedia": ["http://www.yourbettertomorrow.com/presale/images/ads.jpg", "http://bttrack.com/Pixel/Retarget/324", "http://www.yourbettertomorrow.com/presale/images/call-to-action2.png", "http://bat.bing.com/action/0?ti=5441966&Ver=2", "http://www.yourbettertomorrow.com/presale/images/small-1.jpg", "http://www.yourbettertomorrow.com/presale/images/ybtlogo.png", "http://www.yourbettertomorrow.com/presale/images/ps10_2.jpg", "http://www.yourbettertomorrow.com/presale/images/ps10_1.jpg", "http://www.yourbettertomorrow.com/presale/images/smoke1019062015.jpg"], "targetUrl": "http://www.yourbettertomorrow.com/presale/easiest-way-to-stop-smoking-10.php?eid=Mjg=&amp;var1=yav&amp;var2=[var2]&amp;var3=[var3]&amp;eid=11&amp;vid=55920240", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "Be a rich celebrity.", "spoilerPublisher": "savedyouaclick"}, "spoiler": ["Hypnosis"], "spoilerPositions": [[[3, 155], [3, 163]]], "tags": ["phrase"], "predicted_labels": 1}

Exclusive by @ritholtz:"], "postPlatform": "Twitter", "targetParagraphs": ["How much compensation the folks at Pacific Investment Management Co., better known as Pimco, haul in each year has always been a topic of fascination on Wall Street.", "In 2012, news reports suggested that the firm's top 30 partners \"pulled down an average $33 million a year in compensation in recent years.\" A subsequent column by Felix Salmon guessed that the average investment professional at Pimco was making \"roughly $7 million each\" annually.", "A Pimco spokesman denied Salmon's claim, responding that \"The numbers cited in your blog post today are wildly inaccurate.\"", "Salmon's speculation was, indeed, wildly inaccurate -- to the downside. Actual bonuses at Pimco are higher, much higher, than probably any outsiders previously believed. Based on news reports, public records and new data obtained by Bloomberg View, it appears that Pimco had a 2013 bonus pool for its 60 managing directors of almost $1.5 billion.", "So how much have Pimco's top executives earned? According to documents provided to Bloomberg View by someone with knowledge of Pimco's bonus policies, the numbers break down like this: Gross earned $290 million as his year-end bonus for 2013. Mohamed El-Erian, Pimco's former chief executive officer and one-time heir apparent to Gross, received $230 million (El-Erian is a fellow Bloomberg View contributor).", "And the story doesn't end with Pimco's two most visible (former) employees. Former deputy chief investment officer Daniel Ivascyn -- now serving as Gross's replacement as Pimco's chief investment officer -- took home a $70 million bonus. Wendy W. Cupps, the global head of product management, garnered $50 million, making her one of the highest-paid woman in finance. (Her rocky push into equities was the subject of well-publicized haranguing by Gross.) Douglas Hodge, now the CEO, took home $45 million of holiday cheer. These giant bonuses almost make the $22 million awarded to Pimco\u2019s president, Jay Jacobs, seem puny.", "The top three managers after Gross and El-Erian -- Ivascyn, Cupps and Jacobs -- were rumored to have been behind the coup that sent Gross packing to Janus Capital in September. Next month, free of Gross and El-Erian, these three will have an extra half a billion or so to keep to themselves or distribute to the other managing directors.", "Gross\u2019s bonus -- 20 percent of the total bonus pool for 2013 -- places him in a compensation class of his very own. To put that figure into context, in 2013 Gross made just shy of what the next 20 publicly held finance company CEOs made combined.", "In the world of sports, you would have to take the total salaries, winnings and endorsement deals of LeBron James, Lionel Messi, Kobe Bryant, Tiger Woods and Roger Federer -- together -- to be on par with Gross.", "* * *", "How Pimco became such an earnings machine is a quirk.", "It has been four decades since it was spun out of Pacific Life Insurance Co., a move that was made in part to allow Gross a freer hand to manage the insurer\u2019s fixed income portfolio. Since then, Pimco has grown into a behemoth, in terms of the bottom line and as a force in the bond market.", "Much of what we know about Pimco stems from Allianz SE's $3.3 billion purchase of 70 percent of the firm in 2000. A publicly traded German insurer, Allianz has released some details about Pimco\u2019s operations in its quarterly earnings reports. That data, along with mutual fund disclosures and filings, provide hints about the firm\u2019s revenue.", "We can estimate earnings by looking at the largest Pimco funds. The 20 biggest have an average fee of about 61 basis points. Let\u2019s lower that to account for discounts given to large institutional clients, and we get a rough estimate of about 50 basis points. On $1.82 trillion dollars, that yields $9.1 billion in revenue a year.", "Pimco is, by any measure, a fabulously wealthy company. Using my back-of-the-envelope revenue estimate, it generates far more revenue per employee than any bank or asset manager -- almost four times as much as Goldman Sachs.", "When Allianz bought into Pimco, it picked up about $250 billion in assets under management. Pimco currently manages about $2 trillion.", "The bonus structure is a quirk of that original deal: Allianz\u2019 partial purchase left Pacific Life owning 30 percent of Pimco. But Pacific Life wasn't interested in running the asset-management business and even after the Allianz deal, everyone involved continued to defer to Gross\u2019s financial and managerial judgment.", "Thus Pimco -- based in Newport beach, California, and 6,000 miles removed from its majority owners -- remained fully autonomous. Bloomberg View's fee analysis suggests Allianz takes about 70 percent of the total revenue Pimco generates annually (plus or minus a few percentage points). Pimco keeps the rest.", "This same deal structure continued even after Allianz purchased the 30 percent of Pimco that it didn't already own from Pacific Life in the mid-2000s. A subsequent restructuring in 2011 saw Gross and his team gain even greater control over the firm. That gave Pimco so much freedom in relation to its corporate parent that, as one analyst described it to Bloomberg News, it appeared as if it was \"the tail wagging the dog.\"", "* * *", "Part of the reason for Gross's longevity after the Allianz takeover -- and another element of the firm's enormous wealth -- is what we might call the \"Pimco Premium.\" Despite being in a competitive field including giant companies such as Vanguard and Blackrock, Pimco manages to charge more than the industry standard for access to its funds and its separately managed accounts.", "Why? When competing for business, the firm has had an unbeatable combination of a long history and outstanding long-term results. (At least it did, until recent bad bets on rising interest rates by Gross torpedoed the 1-, 3- and 5-year record of the flagship Total Return Fund.)", "Pimco also became the go-to company for the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury in many of the credit facilities used to combat the continuing economic fallout from the financial crisis. Pimco's success in the federal government's program to jumpstart consumer lending and a variety of mortgage-backed security programs added more luster to its reputation. Gross even managed to buy up lots of MBS's before the Fed officially announced the programs. Shareholders of the Total Return Fund netted about $10 billion from its mortgage plays.", "Beyond the sheer size of Pimco's bonuses, there are other aspects of its compensation practices that should give pause to everyone involved in institutional asset management.", "For one, Pimco has been part of a publicly traded company -- Allianz -- for the past 15 years. Unbeknownst to Allianz's shareholders, employees of one of its business units have been paying themselves these extraordinarily large sums of money.", "In the U.S., it is hard to imagine $1.5 billion in spending on anything not being disclosed. Almost 16 percent of Pimco's revenue is a \"material\" amount of money that would normally require disclosure in the U.S. But Allianz is a German company, subject to different regulations.", "Another item worth noticing: Pimco investors represent pension funds, foundations, charitable trusts, 401ks and other retirement accounts. Pimco's enormous, self-paid bonuses come right off of the top of the returns those outside investors might otherwise receive.", "In a recent Allianz presentation following Gross' departure from Pimco, the firm's new chief executive, Doug Hodge, stated, \"We don't comment on matters of compensation.\"", "But while Gross may be gone, the high fees and compensation structure at Pimco appear to remain firmly in place. Allianz doesn't seem inclined to change things -- it started a $279 million award program this fall to keep people from following Gross out the door.", "However, if there is going to be change, it can only come from Pimco's big institutional customers. Why should they pay a Pimco Premium? Pimco's profits are down by 7.9 percent in the third quarter of this year, and the firm saw saw almost $50 billion in outflows last month. Janus, Gross's new home, has managed to attract only about $430 million in new money since he joined.", "The market for fixed income asset management has never been in greater flux than it is today. The realignment of power among bond managers is only just beginning. If ever there was a moment when investors could demand more competitive fees from their bond managers, it is now.", "Perhaps it might also be a good time for Pimco itself to consider slicing its fees. Anecdotally, stories abound of Pimco institutional salespeople offering steep one-year fee discounts as a way to retain assets.", "If I were managing Pimco (even from 6,000 miles away), I would be looking at ways to make those fee reductions more permanent. I bet I even could find close to a billion and a half dollars in savings."], "targetTitle": "Guess How Much Money Bill Gross Made Last Year?", "targetDescription": "The numbers break down like this: Gross earned $290 million as his year-end bonus for 2013.", "targetKeywords": "Money,Earnings,Investment Management,Wall Street,Bond Market,Fixed Income,Sports,California,Wealth,Interest Rates,Federal Reserve,U.S. Treasury,Retirement", "targetMedia": ["http://assets.bwbx.io/images/idaOcRVeUxoY/v1/120x120.jpg", "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iKzjInUDN4qE/v1/1200x-1.jpg", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iKzjInUDN4qE/v1/1200x-1.jpg", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iz9_DLhdXefQ/v1/120x120.jpg", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/i1JWQKZPC96A/v1/120x120.jpg", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iui7bQYay2Cc/v1/120x120.jpg", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/izgCxnl7Ri4I/v1/120x120.jpg", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/ijfX17VuNa34/v1/120x120.jpg", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iK2WFiEHsevU/v0/120x120.png"], "targetUrl": "http://bv.ms/1ut6B6e", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "$290,000,000", "spoilerPublisher": "SavedYouAClick"}, "spoiler": ["$290 million"], "spoilerPositions": [[[4, 198], [4, 210]]], "tags": ["phrase"], "predicted_labels": 1}

As Facebook slowly wades into the real estate development business, the company is pushing an aggressive PR agenda to convince people that Facebook does not exacerbate income inequality in areas where it develops real estate. Facebook has pledged that 15 percent of the new units it creates will go to low- or middle-income families. Which is great until you realize that 85 percent of the building will probably be ridiculously expensive and probably populated by local tech bros.", "Facebook has been embroiled in a fiery debate about income inequality for years. This January, the World Bank published a 330-page report showing how the largest technology companies are increasing income inequality rather than helping it. \"Some of the perceived benefits of digital technologies are offset by emerging risks,\" the report said. \"Many advanced economies face increasingly polarized labor markets and rising inequality\u2014in part because technology augments higher skills while replacing routine jobs, forcing many workers to compete for low-paying jobs.\"", "That\u2019s exactly what happened when Facebook attracted thousands of new residents into the Menlo Park area, where its headquarters is located. Most of the new residents are well-educated, high-income earners who drove up housing pricers, forced lower income families to move, and exacerbated income inequality throughout the area. Obviously, that doesn\u2019t win Mark Zuckerberg many new friends in the area.", "Meanwhile, Facebook is trying to win support for a lucrative proposal to expand its headquarters by 1.1 million square feet. The proposal is still missing some important details, though. For starters, it\u2019s still unclear if Facebook itself will develop the buildings or hire a third party. Secondly, it\u2019s also unclear what the timeline for the development is. Despite lacking specifics, the impact of the proposal is obvious: Facebook would dramatically increase its footprint in an area where it\u2019s already driven up real estate prices and driven out those who can\u2019t afford the rent.", "Sponsored", "This isn\u2019t the first time Facebook has been involved in controversial housing development, either. In 2013, the company built a 394-unit housing community within walking distance of its offices that included its own sports bar, outdoor pool, and pet daycare.", "At the time, a Wall Street Journal report referred to the project as being similar to a \"company town,\" the name for small communities built by robber barons of the 20th century that housed factory workers. The employers provided everything including health care, law enforcement, and even churches. Towns like Pullman, Illinois were created as \"capitalist utopias.\" But ultimately, the bosses failed to protect workers and residents.", "Is Facebook turning Menlo Park into a 21st century version of Pullman? It\u2019s too soon to tell. The new office expansion is slated service at least 6,500 new employees and offering housing to the general public to offset crowding concerns is certainly a gesture on Facebook\u2019s part. But while some poor people will get homes in the new real estate development, it\u2019s surely won\u2019t be enough to fix the area\u2019s greater socioeconomic problems.", "[Wall Street Journal]"], "targetTitle": "Facebook Is Building Apartments Anyone Can Rent\u2014But There's a Huge Catch", "targetDescription": "Facebook could be your next landlord.

After months of deliberating, and a worsening condition, Kelly decides to upload her consciousness to San Junipero, living out her days with Yorkie.", "Written down, it sounds like a semi-morbid tale of death.

In the last seven years in which the S&P 500 rose in each of the first three quarters, only in one of them \u2014 2007 \u2014 did the index drop in the fourth.", "Actually, when one looks at the entire performance history of the S&P 500 going back to 1928 (which is available despite the fact that the index was technically created in 1957) one finds that out of the 19 years in which the market rose in the first, second and third quarters, a negative fourth quarter only followed five times. In these 19 years, the S&P's median performance was a 4.1 percent gain, according to a CNBC analysis of FactSet data.", "That 74 percent \"win rate\" and impressive median gain for fourth quarters following three consecutive winning quarters compares to a 62 percent win rate for the S&P over all of its 355 quarters, and average quarterly performance of a 2.5 percent gain. However, it is also the case that the fourth quarter just happens to be better for investors in general; the market rose in 73 percent of fourth quarters, and actually turned out a better median performance of a 4.5 percent gain.", "The recent rises seen in fourth quarters can thus be ascribed to market seasonality \u2014 or, perhaps more credibly, to mere randomness.", "But for the bullish strategist Tom Lee of Fundstrat, who has pointed to similar figures in the past, something more is at work. Lee argues that in years when stocks are doing well, active managers will invest heavily in an attempt to avoid lagging the market too badly \u2014 creating an additional bullish force in the market. The fact that 2016 has been a good year so far is therefore a reason to bet that stocks will rise, he concludes.", "So will the fourth quarter, which begins on Monday, continue the bullish trend?",

Photo: Adam Pretty", "Critics and social media have predecessor. Critics and social media have savaged NBC \u2019s early coverage of the Rio Olympics \u2014 and the early ratings verdict from Nielsen has not been any kinder. Viewership for the first three nights of the Peacock\u2019s prime-time broadcasts is down sharply compared to both the 2012 London and 2008 Beijing games, with younger audiences bailing in particularly big numbers. It\u2019s not all bad news: Tens of millions of Americans are still watching the Olympics, some viewing has likely shifted to online platforms not immediately measured by Nielsen, and Sunday\u2019s swimming-centric schedule resulted in a big ratings surge. But if the early pattern holds, Rio will be the first summer Olympics since Sydney 2000 to score lower Nielsen numbers than itspredecessor.", "The first sign of trouble for NBC \u2019s Rio ratings came Saturday morning, when data for Friday\u2019s never-ending opening ceremony came in. Per Nielsen, the minimalist curtain-raiser notched a 13.9 household rating (i.e., the percentage of homes with TV sets tuned to the Olympics). While that\u2019s more than two times the audience for the typical episode of the summer\u2019s No. 1 series, NBC \u2019s America\u2019s Got Talent , it represents an eye-popping 35 percent drop from night one of the London games (which notched a 21.0 rating) and the lowest rating for an opening ceremony in at least 20 years. (The runner-up? Athens 2004, which averaged a 14.6 rating.) Worse, the 13.9 rating is just barely ahead of the average edition of NBC \u2019s Sunday Night Football last fall (12.9) rating.", "Things didn\u2019t improve much on Saturday, the first night of competition: NBC averaged an 11.4 for its prime-time broadcast, down about 28 percent from London\u2019s 15.8 and another at least 20-year low. Part of the problem is big defections among millennial audiences, i.e. the audience segment most likely to be turned off by NBC \u2019s non-stop commercial breaks. Final numbers aren\u2019t in yet, but among adults aged 18 to 34, it looks like Friday\u2019s opening was down around 43 percent compared to London (versus the aforementioned 35 percent decline among viewers of all ages). Perhaps some of that audience shifted to NBC \u2019s livestream simulcast, but given how much of the network\u2019s ad revenue is tied to linear ratings, that won\u2019t be of much comfort to Peacock accountants. Still, expect NBC to play up big gains for digital and other platforms when it releases so-called \"total audience\" measurement data later this week.", "It\u2019s also far too early to declare Rio any sort of ratings disaster. NBC \u2019s Olympics ratings often rise and fall based on how well the U.S. team is doing at any given time, and Sunday\u2019s stellar swimming performances by Katie Ledecky and Michael Phelps \u2014 telegraphed by social media ahead of their broadcast to American audiences \u2014 delivered a massive Nielsen boost for NBC . Early numbers show the network\u2019s prime-time coverage jumping to a best-yet 15.9 household rating, the first time since Athens 2004 that a night three of the Olympics has come in ahead of the opening ceremonies. What\u2019s more, while viewership was still down compared to London, it fell a more modest 20 percent and looks to be above tune-in for the comparable nights in both Athens and Sydney. If Team USA can keep winning, NBC still has a shot at making up some of the losses from the first weekend of the Games."], "targetTitle": "Rio Olympics Ratings Are the Worst They\u2019ve Been in Years", "targetDescription": "If Team USA can keep winning, that may change.", "targetKeywords": "2016 olympics, nbc, ratings", "targetMedia": ["http://archive.is/bmY5H/66841c4f2e7cf12a6ef4d920fc0b9ef431a81e4c.jpg", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex/6gNJowqlzHFZ/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==", "http://archive.is/bmY5H/9099b809706b56d6814cd46078aaa483ea619f20/scr.png", "http://archive.is/bmY5H/ef35b2187b0f8b194e067a86c612cc4f85285bce.jpg", "data:image/png;base64,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"], "targetUrl": "http://archive.is/bmY5H", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "Too soon to tell, probably streaming", "spoilerPublisher": "savedyouaclick"}, "spoiler": ["far too early to declare Rio any sort of ratings disaster"], "spoilerPositions": [[[4, 10], [4, 67]]], "tags": ["passage"], "predicted_labels": 0}

I further call upon the authorities to protect and support survivors participating in judicial proceedings through, inter alia, referrals to free legal aid, psychosocial and health services, as well as economic empowerment programmes", "15/19 Ivory Coast Recommendation: I urge the Government of Co\u0302te d\u2019Ivoire to ensure the effective implementation of its national strategy to combat gender-based violence and the action plan for FRCI, and call on the international community to support these efforts. It is critical to accelerate disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and strengthen law enforcement to ensure that ex-combatants who have been reintegrated into the transport sector do not pose a risk to women and girls who are reliant on those services. The Government and the international community must provide monitoring and awareness-raising to mitigate the possibility of a recurrence of sexual violence in the context of the presidential elections to be held in October 2015", "16/19 Liberia Recommendation: I call on the Government of Liberia to continue its critical efforts to combat sexual and gender-based violence including through the United Nations-Government of Liberia Joint Programme, and in the context of recovery from the Ebola virus epidemic", "17/19 Nepal Recommendation: I encourage the Government to ensure that survivors of conflict-related sexual violence are recognized under the law as \"conflict victims\", which will enable them to access services, judicial remedies and reparations. I further call on all parties involved in the transitional justice process to ensure that the rights and needs o f survivors of sexual violence are addressed in institutional reforms and that these crimes are excluded from amnesties and statutes of limitations", "18/19 Sri Lanka Recommendation: I call upon the newly elected Government of Sri Lanka to investigate allegations of sexual violence, including against national armed and security forces, and to provide multisectoral services for survivors, including reparations and economic empowerment programmes for women at risk, including war widows and female heads of household", "19/19 Nigeria Recommendation: I encourage the Government to implement its national action plan on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) to ensure that women\u2019s protection concerns are mainstreamed throughout its security operations. I also call upon the authorities to guarantee security in and around internally displaced persons camps and to extend medical and psychosocial services to high-risk areas", "Whether existing definitions are appropriate entirely depends on your point of view of course. It is not an awfully long time ago that rape was regarded fundamentally not as a crime of violence against women, but as a crime against the property of men (ie their wives or daughters), which is why marital rape was for so long excluded. We have \u2013 for the most part \u2013 moved on from the deepest depths of that patriarchal approach but there any many who argue that the maintenance of \u2018phallo-centric\u2019 rape definitions means that the seriousness of other forms of penetrative assault are underplayed.", "Brock Turner\u2019s conviction, and the bravely stark testimony of his victim, have helped to bring these questions about how sexual crimes are defined \u2013 and how that impacts on attitudes towards sentencing \u2013 out into the open. The tragedy is that no level of public debate or outrage can undo the despicable harm he caused to an unconscious woman.", "Read the Stanford victim's full impact statement", "Your honor,", "If it is all right, for the majority of this statement I would like to address the defendant directly.", "You don\u2019t know me, but you\u2019ve been inside me, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here today.", "On January 17th, 2015, it was a quiet Saturday night at home. My dad made some dinner and I sat at the table with my younger sister who was visiting for the weekend. I was working full time and it was approaching my bed time. I planned to stay at home by myself, watch some TV and read, while she went to a party with her friends. Then, I decided it was my only night with her, I had nothing better to do, so why not, there\u2019s a dumb party ten minutes from my house, I would go, dance weird like a fool, and embarrass my younger sister. On the way there, I joked that undergrad guys would have braces. My sister teased me for wearing a beige cardigan to a frat party like a librarian. I called myself \"big mama\", because I knew I\u2019d be the oldest one there. I made silly faces, let my guard down, and drank liquor too fast not factoring in that my tolerance had significantly lowered since college.", "The next thing I remember I was in a gurney in a hallway. I had dried blood and bandages on the backs of my hands and elbow. I thought maybe I had fallen and was in an admin office on campus. I was very calm and wondering where my sister was. A deputy explained I had been assaulted. I still remained calm, assured he was speaking to the wrong person. I knew no one at this party. When I was finally allowed to use the restroom, I pulled down the hospital pants they had given me, went to pull down my underwear, and felt nothing. I still remember the feeling of my hands touching my skin and grabbing nothing. I looked down and there was nothing. The thin piece of fabric, the only thing between my vagina and anything else, was missing and everything inside me was silenced. I still don\u2019t have words for that feeling. In order to keep breathing, I thought maybe the policemen used scissors to cut them off for evidence.", "Then, I felt pine needles scratching the back of my neck and started pulling them out my hair. I thought maybe, the pine needles had fallen from a tree onto my head. My brain was talking my gut into not collapsing. Because my gut was saying, help me, help me.", "I shuffled from room to room with a blanket wrapped around me, pine needles trailing behind me, I left a little pile in every room I sat in. I was asked to sign papers that said \"Rape Victim\" and I thought something has really happened. My clothes were confiscated and I stood naked while the nurses held a ruler to various abrasions on my body and photographed them. The three of us worked to comb the pine needles out of my hair, six hands to fill one paper bag. To calm me down, they said it\u2019s just the flora and fauna, flora and fauna. I had multiple swabs inserted into my vagina and anus, needles for shots, pills, had a nikon pointed right into my spread legs. I had long, pointed beaks inside me and had my vagina smeared with cold, blue paint to check for abrasions.", "After a few hours of this, they let me shower. I stood there examining my body beneath the stream of water and decided, I don\u2019t want my body anymore. I was terrified of it, I didn\u2019t know what had been in it, if it had been contaminated, who had touched it. I wanted to take off my body like a jacket and leave it at the hospital with everything else.", "On that morning, all that I was told was that I had been found behind a dumpster, potentially penetrated by a stranger, and that I should get retested for HIV because results don\u2019t always show up immediately. But for now, I should go home and get back to my normal life. Imagine stepping back into the world with only that information. They gave me huge hugs, and then I walked out of the hospital into the parking lot wearing the new sweatshirt and sweatpants they provided me, as they had only allowed me to keep my necklace and shoes.", "My sister picked me up, face wet from tears and contorted in anguish. Instinctively and immediately, I wanted to take away her pain. I smiled at her, I told her to look at me, I\u2019m right here, I\u2019m okay, everything\u2019s okay, I\u2019m right here. My hair is washed and clean, they gave me the strangest shampoo, calm down, and look at me. Look at these funny new sweatpants and sweatshirt, I look like a P.E. teacher, let\u2019s go home, let\u2019s eat something. She did not know that beneath my sweats, I had scratches and bandages on my skin, my vagina was sore and had become a strange, dark color from all the prodding, my underwear was missing, and I felt too empty to continue to speak. That I was also afraid, that I was also devastated. That day we drove home and for hours my sister held me.", "My boyfriend did not know what happened, but called that day and said, \"I was really worried about you last night, you scared me, did you make it home okay?\" I was horrified. That\u2019s when I learned I had called him that night in my blackout, left an incomprehensible voicemail, that we had also spoken on the phone, but I was slurring so heavily he was scared for me, that he repeatedly told me to go find my sister. Again, he asked me, \"What happened last night? Did you make it home okay?\" I said yes, and hung up to cry.", "I was not ready to tell my boyfriend or parents that actually, I may have been raped behind a dumpster, but I don\u2019t know by who or when or how. If I told them, I would see the fear on their faces, and mine would multiply by tenfold, so instead I pretended the whole thing wasn\u2019t real.", "I tried to push it out of my mind, but it was so heavy I didn\u2019t talk, I didn\u2019t eat, I didn\u2019t sleep, I didn\u2019t interact with anyone. After work, I would drive to a secluded place to scream. I didn\u2019t talk, I didn\u2019t eat, I didn\u2019t sleep, I didn\u2019t interact with anyone, and I became isolated from the ones I loved most. For one week after the incident, I didn\u2019t get any calls or updates about that night or what happened to me. The only symbol that proved that it hadn\u2019t just been a bad dream, was the sweatshirt from the hospital in my drawer.", "One day, I was at work, scrolling through the news on my phone, and came across an article. In it, I read and learned for the first time about how I was found unconscious, with my hair disheveled, long necklace wrapped around my neck, bra pulled out of my dress, dress pulled off over my shoulders and pulled up above my waist, that I was butt naked all the way down to my boots, legs spread apart, and had been penetrated by a foreign object by someone I did not recognize. This was how I learned what happened to me, sitting at my desk reading the news at work. I learned what happened to me the same time everyone else in the world learned what happened to me. That\u2019s when the pine needles in my hair made sense, they didn\u2019t fall from a tree. He had taken off my underwear, his fingers had been inside of me. I don\u2019t even know this person. I still don\u2019t know this person. When I read about me like this, I said, this can\u2019t be me.", "This can\u2019t be me. I could not digest or accept any of this information. I could not imagine my family having to read about this online. I kept reading. In the next paragraph, I read something that I will never forgive; I read that according to him, I liked it. I liked it. Again, I do not have words for these feelings.", "At the bottom of the article, after I learned about the graphic details of my own sexual assault, the article listed his swimming times. She was found breathing, unresponsive with her underwear six inches away from her bare stomach curled in fetal position. By the way, he\u2019s really good at swimming. Throw in my mile time if that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. I\u2019m good at cooking, put that in there, I think the end is where you list your extra-curriculars to cancel out all the sickening things that\u2019ve happened.", "The night the news came out I sat my parents down and told them that I had been assaulted, to not look at the news because it\u2019s upsetting, just know that I\u2019m okay, I\u2019m right here, and I\u2019m okay. But halfway through telling them, my mom had to hold me because I could no longer stand up. I was not okay.", "The night after it happened, he said he didn\u2019t know my name, said he wouldn\u2019t be able to identify my face in a lineup, didn\u2019t mention any dialogue between us, no words, only dancing and kissing. Dancing is a cute term; was it snapping fingers and twirling dancing, or just bodies grinding up against each other in a crowded room? I wonder if kissing was just faces sloppily pressed up against each other? When the detective asked if he had planned on taking me back to his dorm, he said no. When the detective asked how we ended up behind the dumpster, he said he didn\u2019t know. He admitted to kissing other girls at that party, one of whom was my own sister who pushed him away. He admitted to wanting to hook up with someone. I was the wounded antelope of the herd, completely alone and vulnerable, physically unable to fend for myself, and he chose me. Sometimes I think, if I hadn\u2019t gone, then this never would\u2019ve happened. But then I realized, it would have happened, just to somebody else. You were about to enter four years of access to drunk girls and parties, and if this is the foot you started off on, then it is right you did not continue.", "The night after it happened, he said he thought I liked it because I rubbed his back. A back rub. Never mentioned me voicing consent, never mentioned us speaking, a back rub.", "One more time, in public news, I learned that my ass and vagina were completely exposed outside, my breasts had been groped, fingers had been jabbed inside me along with pine needles and debris, my bare skin and head had been rubbing against the ground behind a dumpster, while an erect freshman was humping my half naked, unconscious body. But I don\u2019t remember, so how do I prove I didn\u2019t like it.", "I thought there\u2019s no way this is going to trial; there were witnesses, there was dirt in my body, he ran but was caught. He\u2019s going to settle, formally apologize, and we will both move on. Instead, I was told he hired a powerful attorney, expert witnesses, private investigators who were going to try and find details about my personal life to use against me, find loopholes in my story to invalidate me and my sister, in order to show that this sexual assault was in fact a misunderstanding. That he was going to go to any length to convince the world he had simply been confused.", "I was not only told that I was assaulted, I was told that because I couldn\u2019t remember, I technically could not prove it was unwanted. And that distorted me, damaged me, almost broke me. It is the saddest type of confusion to be told I was assaulted and nearly raped, blatantly out in the open, but we don\u2019t know if it counts as assault yet. I had to fight for an entire year to make it clear that there was something wrong with this situation.", "When I was told to be prepared in case we didn\u2019t win, I said, I can\u2019t prepare for that. He was guilty the minute I woke up. No one can talk me out of the hurt he caused me. Worst of all, I was warned, because he now knows you don\u2019t remember, he is going to get to write the script. He can say whatever he wants and no one can contest it. I had no power, I had no voice, I was defenseless. My memory loss would be used against me. My testimony was weak, was incomplete, and I was made to believe that perhaps, I am not enough to win this. That\u2019s so damaging. His attorney constantly reminded the jury, the only one we can believe is Brock, because she doesn\u2019t remember. That helplessness was traumatizing.", "Instead of taking time to heal, I was taking time to recall the night in excruciating detail, in order to prepare for the attorney\u2019s questions that would be invasive, aggressive, and designed to steer me off course, to contradict myself, my sister, phrased in ways to manipulate my answers. Instead of his attorney saying, Did you notice any abrasions? He said, You didn\u2019t notice any abrasions, right? This was a game of strategy, as if I could be tricked out of my own worth. The sexual assault had been so clear, but instead, here I was at the trial, answering question like:", "How old are you? How much do you weigh? What did you eat that day? Well what did you have for dinner? Who made dinner? Did you drink with dinner? No, not even water? When did you drink? How much did you drink? What container did you drink out of? Who gave you the drink? How much do you usually drink? Who dropped you off at this party? At what time? But where exactly? What were you wearing? Why were you going to this party? What\u2019d you do when you got there? Are you sure you did that? But what time did you do that? What does this text mean? Who were you texting? When did you urinate? Where did you urinate? With whom did you urinate outside? Was your phone on silent when your sister called? Do you remember silencing it? Really because on page 53 I\u2019d like to point out that you said it was set to ring. Did you drink in college? You said you were a party animal? How many times did you black out? Did you party at frats? Are you serious with your boyfriend? Are you sexually active with him? When did you start dating? Would you ever cheat? Do you have a history of cheating? What do you mean when you said you wanted to reward him? Do you remember what time you woke up? Were you wearing your cardigan? What color was your cardigan? Do you remember any more from that night? No? Okay, we\u2019ll let Brock fill it in.", "I was pummeled with narrowed, pointed questions that dissected my personal life, love life, past life, family life, inane questions, accumulating trivial details to try and find an excuse for this guy who didn\u2019t even take the time to ask me for my name, who had me naked a handful of minutes after seeing me. After a physical assault, I was assaulted with questions designed to attack me, to say see, her facts don\u2019t line up, she\u2019s out of her mind, she\u2019s practically an alcoholic, she probably wanted to hook up, he\u2019s like an athlete right, they were both drunk, whatever, the hospital stuff she remembers is after the fact, why take it into account, Brock has a lot at stake so he\u2019s having a really hard time right now.", "And then it came time for him to testify. This is where I became revictimized. I want to remind you, the night after it happened he said he never planned to take me back to his dorm. He said he didn\u2019t know why we were behind a dumpster. He got up to leave because he wasn\u2019t feeling well when he was suddenly chased and attacked. Then he learned I could not remember.", "So one year later, as predicted, a new dialogue emerged. Brock had a strange new story, almost sounded like a poorly written young adult novel with kissing and dancing and hand holding and lovingly tumbling onto the ground, and most importantly in this new story, there was suddenly consent. One year after the incident, he remembered, oh yeah, by the way she actually said yes, to everything, so.", "He said he had asked if I wanted to dance. Apparently I said yes. He\u2019d asked if I wanted to go to his dorm, I said yes. Then he asked if he could finger me and I said yes. Most guys don\u2019t ask, Can I finger you? Usually there\u2019s a natural progression of things, unfolding consensually, not a Q and A. But apparently I granted full permission. He\u2019s in the clear.", "Even in this story, there\u2019s barely any dialogue; I only said a total of three words before he had me half naked on the ground. I have never been penetrated after three words. He didn\u2019t claim to hear me speak one full sentence that night, so in the news when it says we \"met\", I\u2019m not sure I would go so far as to say that. Future reference, if you are confused about whether a girl can consent, see if she can speak an entire sentence. You couldn\u2019t even do that. Just one coherent string of words. If she can\u2019t do that, then no. Don\u2019t touch her, just no. Not maybe, just no. Where was the confusion? This is common sense, human decency.", "According to him, the only reason we were on the ground was because I fell down. Note; if a girl falls help her get back up. If she is too drunk to even walk and falls, do not mount her, hump her, take off her underwear, and insert your hand inside her vagina. If a girl falls help her up. If she is wearing a cardigan over her dress don\u2019t take it off so that you can touch her breasts. Maybe she is cold, maybe that\u2019s why she wore the cardigan. If her bare ass and legs are rubbing the pinecones and needles, while the weight of you pushes into her, get off her.", "Next in the story, two people approached you. You ran because you said you felt scared. I argue that you were scared because you\u2019d be caught, not because you were scared of two terrifying Swedish grad students. The idea that you thought you were being attacked out of the blue was ludicrous. That it had nothing to do with you being on top my unconscious body. You were caught red handed, with no explanation. When they tackled you why didn\u2019t [you] say, \"Stop! Everything\u2019s okay, go ask her, she\u2019s right over there, she\u2019ll tell you.\" I mean you had just asked for my consent, right? I was awake, right? When the policeman arrived and interviewed the evil Swede who tackled you, he was crying so hard he couldn\u2019t speak because of what he\u2019d seen. Also, if you really did think they were dangerous, you just abandoned a half-naked girl to run and save yourself. No matter which way you frame it, it doesn\u2019t make sense.", "Your attorney has repeatedly pointed out, well we don\u2019t know exactly when she became unconscious. And you\u2019re right, maybe I was still fluttering my eyes and wasn\u2019t completely limp yet, fine. His guilt did not depend on him knowing the exact second that I became unconscious, that is never what this was about. I was slurring, too drunk to consent way before I was on the ground. I should have never been touched in the first place. Brock stated, \"At no time did I see that she was not responding. If at any time I thought she was not responding, I would have stopped immediately.\" Here\u2019s the thing; if your plan was to stop only when I was literally unresponsive, then you still do not understand. You didn\u2019t even stop when I was unconscious anyway! Someone else stopped you. Two guys on bikes noticed I wasn\u2019t moving in the dark and had to tackle you. How did you not notice while on top of me?", "You said, you would have stopped and gotten help. You say that, but I want you to explain how you would\u2019ve helped me, step by step, walk me through this. I want to know, if those evil Swedes had not found me, how the night would have played out. I am asking you; Would you have pulled my underwear back on over my boots? Untangled the necklace wrapped around my neck? Closed my legs, covered me? Tucked my bra back into my dress? Would you have helped me pick the needles from my hair? Asked if the abrasions on my neck and bottom hurt? Would you then go find a friend and say, Will you help me get her somewhere warm and soft? I don\u2019t sleep when I think about the way it could have gone if the Swedes had never come. What would have happened to me? That\u2019s what you\u2019ll never have a good answer for, that\u2019s what you can\u2019t explain even after a year.", "To sit under oath and inform all of us, that yes I wanted it, yes I permitted it, and that you are the true victim attacked by guys for reasons unknown to you is sick, is demented, is selfish, is stupid. It shows that you were willing to go to any length, to discredit me, invalidate me, and explain why it was okay to hurt me. You tried unyieldingly to save yourself, your reputation, at my expense.", "My family had to see pictures of my head strapped to a gurney full of pine needles, of my body in the dirt with my eyes closed, dress hiked up, limbs limp in the dark. And then even after that, my family had to listen to your attorney say, the pictures were after the fact, we can dismiss them. To say, yes her nurse confirmed there was redness and abrasions inside her, but that\u2019s what happens when you finger someone, and he\u2019s already admitted to that. To listen to him use my own sister against me. To listen him attempt to paint of a picture of me, the seductive party animal, as if somehow that would make it so that I had this coming for me. To listen to him say I sounded drunk on the phone because I\u2019m silly and that\u2019s my goofy way of speaking. To point out that in the voicemail, I said I would reward my boyfriend and we all know what I was thinking. I assure you my rewards program is non-transferable, especially to any nameless man that approaches me.", "The point is, this is everything my family and I endured during the trial. This is everything I had to sit through silently, taking it, while he shaped the evening. It is enough to be suffering. It is another thing to have someone ruthlessly working to diminish the gravity and validity of this suffering. But in the end, his unsupported statements and his attorney\u2019s twisted logic fooled no one. The truth won, the truth spoke for itself.", "You are guilty. Twelve jurors convicted you guilty of three felony counts beyond reasonable doubt, that\u2019s twelve votes per count, thirty-six yeses confirming guilt, that\u2019s one hundred percent, unanimous guilt. And I thought finally it is over, finally he will own up to what he did, truly apologize, we will both move on and get better. Then I read your statement.", "If you are hoping that one of my organs will implode from anger and I will die, I\u2019m almost there. You are very close. Assault is not an accident. This is not a story of another drunk college hookup with poor decision making. Somehow, you still don\u2019t get it. Somehow, you still sound confused.", "I will now take this opportunity to read portions of the defendant\u2019s statement and respond to them.", "You said, Being drunk I just couldn\u2019t make the best decisions and neither could she.", "Alcohol is not an excuse. Is it a factor? Yes. But alcohol was not the one who stripped me, fingered me, had my head dragging against the ground, with me almost fully naked. Having too much to drink was an amateur mistake that I admit to, but it is not criminal. Everyone in this room has had a night where they have regretted drinking too much, or knows someone close to them who has had a night where they have regretted drinking too much. Regretting drinking is not the same as regretting sexual assault. We were both drunk, the difference is I did not take off your pants and underwear, touch you inappropriately, and run away. That\u2019s the difference.", "You said, If I wanted to get to know her, I should have asked for her number, rather than asking her to go back to my room.", "I\u2019m not mad because you didn\u2019t ask for my number. Even if you did know me, I would not want [to] be in this situation. My own boyfriend knows me, but if he asked to finger me behind a dumpster, I would slap him. No girl wants to be in this situation. Nobody. I don\u2019t care if you know their phone number or not.", "You said, I stupidly thought it was okay for me to do what everyone around me was doing, which was drinking. I was wrong.", "Again, you were not wrong for drinking. Everyone around you was not sexually assaulting me. You were wrong for doing what nobody else was doing, which was pushing your erect dick in your pants against my naked, defenseless body concealed in a dark area, where partygoers could no longer see or protect me, and own my sister could not find me. Sipping fireball is not your crime. Peeling off and discarding my underwear like a candy wrapper to insert your finger into my body, is where you went wrong. Why am I still explaining this.", "You said, During the trial I didn\u2019t want to victimize her at all. That was just my attorney and his way of approaching the case.", "Your attorney is not your scapegoat, he represents you. Did your attorney say some incredulously infuriating, degrading things? Absolutely. He said you had an erection, because it was cold. I have no words.", "You said, you are in the process of establishing a program for high school and college students in which you speak about your experience to \"speak out against the college campus drinking culture and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that.\"", "Speak out against campus drinking culture. That\u2019s what we\u2019re speaking out against? You think that\u2019s what I\u2019ve spent the past year fighting for? Not awareness about campus sexual assault, or rape, or learning to recognize consent. Campus drinking culture. Down with Jack Daniels. Down with Skyy Vodka. If you want talk to high school kids about drinking go to an AA meeting. You realize, having a drinking problem is different than drinking and then forcefully trying to have sex with someone? Show men how to respect women, not how to drink less.", "Drinking culture and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that. Goes along with that, like a side effect, like fries on the side of your order. Where does promiscuity even come into play? I don\u2019t see headlines that read, Brock Turner, Guilty of drinking too much and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that. Campus [Sexual] Assault. There\u2019s your first powerpoint slide.", "I have done enough explaining. You do not get to shrug your shoulders and be confused anymore. You do not get to pretend that there were no red flags. You do not get to not know why you ran. You have been convicted of violating me with malicious intent, and all you can admit to is consuming alcohol. Do not talk about the sad way your life was upturned because alcohol made you do bad things. Figure out how to take responsibility for your own conduct.", "Lastly you said, I want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin a life.", "Ruin a life, one life, yours, you forgot about mine. Let me rephrase for you, I want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin two lives. You and me. You are the cause, I am the effect. You have dragged me through this hell with you, dipped me back into that night again and again. You knocked down both our towers, I collapsed at the same time you did. Your damage was concrete; stripped of titles, degrees, enrollment. My damage was internal, unseen, I carry it with me. You took away my worth, my privacy, my energy, my time, my safety, my intimacy, my confidence, my own voice, until today.", "See one thing we have in common is that we were both unable to get up in the morning. I am no stranger to suffering. You made me a victim. In newspapers my name was \"unconscious intoxicated woman\", ten syllables, and nothing more than that. For a while, I believed that that was all I was. I had to force myself to relearn my real name, my identity. To relearn that this is not all that I am. That I am not just a drunk victim at a frat party found behind a dumpster, while you are the All-American swimmer at a top university, innocent until proven guilty, with so much at stake. I am a human being who has been irreversibly hurt, who waited a year to figure out if I was worth something.", "My independence, natural joy, gentleness, and steady lifestyle I had been enjoying became distorted beyond recognition. I became closed off, angry, self-deprecating, tired, irritable, empty. The isolation at times was unbearable. You cannot give me back the life I had before that night either. While you worry about your shattered reputation, I refrigerated spoons every night so when I woke up, and my eyes were puffy from crying, I would hold the spoons to my eyes to lessen the swelling so that I could see. I showed up an hour late to work every morning, excused myself to cry in the stairwells, I can tell you all the best places in that building to cry where no one can hear you, the pain became so bad that I had to tell my boss I was leaving, I needed time because continuing day to day was not possible. I used my savings to go as far away as I could possibly be.", "I can\u2019t sleep alone at night without having a light on, like a five year old, because I have nightmares of being touched where I cannot wake up, I did this thing where I waited until the sun came up and I felt safe enough to sleep. For three months, I went to bed at six o\u2019clock in the morning.", "I used to pride myself on my independence, now I am afraid to go on walks in the evening, to attend social events with drinking among friends where I should be comfortable being. I have become a little barnacle always needing to be at someone\u2019s side, to have my boyfriend standing next to me, sleeping beside me, protecting me. It is embarrassing how feeble I feel, how timidly I move through life, always guarded, ready to defend myself, ready to be angry.", "You have no idea how hard I have worked to rebuild parts of me that are still weak. It took me eight months to even talk about what happened. I could no longer connect with friends, with everyone around me. I would scream at my boyfriend, my own family whenever they brought this up. You never let me forget what happened to me. At the of end of the hearing, the trial, I was too tired to speak. I would leave drained, silent. I would go home turn off my phone and for days I would not speak. You bought me a ticket to a planet where I lived by myself. Every time a new article [would] come out, I lived with the paranoia that my entire hometown would find out and know me as the girl who got assaulted. I didn\u2019t want anyone\u2019s pity and am still learning to accept victim as part of my identity. You made my own hometown an uncomfortable place to be.", "Someday, you can pay me back for my ambulance ride and therapy. But you cannot give me back my sleepless nights. The way I have broken down sobbing uncontrollably if I\u2019m watching a movie and a woman is harmed, to say it lightly, this experience has expanded my empathy for other victims. I have lost weight from stress, when people would comment I told them I\u2019ve been running a lot lately. There are times I did not want to be touched. I have to relearn that I am not fragile, I am capable, I am wholesome, not just livid and weak.", "I want to say this. All the crying, the hurting you have imposed on me, I can take it. But when I see my younger sister hurting, when she is unable to keep up in school, when she is deprived of joy, when she is not sleeping, when she is crying so hard on the phone she is barely breathing, telling me over and over she is sorry for leaving me alone that night, sorry sorry sorry, when she feels more guilt than you, then I do not forgive you. That night I had called her to try and find her, but you found me first. Your attorney\u2019s closing statement began, \"My sister said she was fine and who knows her better than her sister.\" You tried to use my own sister against me. Your points of attack were so weak, so low, it was almost embarrassing. You do not touch her.", "If you think I was spared, came out unscathed, that today I ride off into sunset, while you suffer the greatest blow, you are mistaken. Nobody wins. We have all been devastated, we have all been trying to find some meaning in all of this suffering.", "You should have never done this to me. Secondly, you should have never made me fight so long to tell you, you should have never done this to me. But here we are. The damage is done, no one can undo it. And now we both have a choice. We can let this destroy us, I can remain angry and hurt and you can be in denial, or we can face it head on, I accept the pain, you accept the punishment, and we move on.", "Your life is not over, you have decades of years ahead to rewrite your story. The world is huge, it is so much bigger than Palo Alto and Stanford, and you will make a space for yourself in it where you can be useful and happy. Right now your name is tainted, so I challenge you to make a new name for yourself, to do something so good for the world, it blows everyone away. You have a brain and a voice and a heart. Use them wisely. You possess immense love from your family. That alone can pull you out of anything. Mine has held me up through all of this. Yours will hold you and you will go on.", "I believe, that one day, you will understand all of this better. I hope you will become a better more honest person who can properly use this story to prevent another story like this from ever happening again. I fully support your journey to healing, to rebuilding your life, because that is the only way you\u2019ll begin to help others.", "Now to address the sentencing. When I read the probation officer\u2019s report, I was in disbelief, consumed by anger which eventually quieted down to profound sadness. My statements have been slimmed down to distortion and taken out of context. I fought hard during this trial and will not have the outcome minimized by a probation officer who attempted to evaluate my current state and my wishes in a fifteen minute conversation, the majority of which was spent answering questions I had about the legal system. The context is also important. Brock had yet to issue a statement, and I had not read his remarks.", "My life has been on hold for over a year, a year of anger, anguish and uncertainty, until a jury of my peers rendered a judgment that validated the injustices I had endured. Had Brock admitted guilt and remorse and offered to settle early on, I would have considered a lighter sentence, respecting his honesty, grateful to be able to move our lives forward. Instead he took the risk of going to trial, added insult to injury and forced me to relive the hurt as details about my personal life and sexual assault were brutally dissected before the public. He pushed me and my family through a year of inexplicable, unnecessary suffering, and should face the consequences of challenging his crime, of putting my pain into question, of making us wait so long for justice.", "I told the probation officer I do not want Brock to rot away in prison. I did not say he does not deserve to be behind bars. The probation officer\u2019s recommendation of a year or less in county jail is a soft time-out, a mockery of the seriousness of his assaults, and of the consequences of the pain I have been forced to endure. I also told the probation officer that what I truly wanted was for Brock to get it, to understand and admit to his wrongdoing.", "Unfortunately, after reading the defendant\u2019s statement, I am severely disappointed and feel that he has failed to exhibit sincere remorse or responsibility for his conduct. I fully respected his right to a trial, but even after twelve jurors unanimously convicted him guilty of three felonies, all he has admitted to doing is ingesting alcohol. Someone who cannot take full accountability for his actions does not deserve a mitigating sentence. It is deeply offensive that he would try and dilute rape with a suggestion of promiscuity. By definition rape is the absence of promiscuity, rape is the absence of consent, and it perturbs me deeply that he can\u2019t even see that distinction.", "The probation officer factored in that the defendant is youthful and has no prior convictions. In my opinion, he is old enough to know what he did was wrong. When you are eighteen in this country you can go to war. When you are nineteen, you are old enough to pay the consequences for attempting to rape someone. He is young, but he is old enough to know better.", "As this is a first offense I can see where leniency would beckon. On the other hand, as a society, we cannot forgive everyone\u2019s first sexual assault or digital rape. It doesn\u2019t make sense. The seriousness of rape has to be communicated clearly, we should not create a culture that suggests we learn that rape is wrong through trial and error. The consequences of sexual assault needs to be severe enough that people feel enough fear to exercise good judgment even if they are drunk, severe enough to be preventative. The fact that Brock was a star athlete at a prestigious university should not be seen as an entitlement to leniency, but as an opportunity to send a strong cultural message that sexual assault is against the law regardless of social class.", "The probation officer weighed the fact that he has surrendered a hard earned swimming scholarship. If I had been sexually assaulted by an un-athletic guy from a community college, what would his sentence be? If a first time offender from an underprivileged background was accused of three felonies and displayed no accountability for his actions other than drinking, what would his sentence be? How fast he swims does not lessen the impact of what happened to me.", "The Probation Officer has stated that this case, when compared to other crimes of similar nature, may be considered less serious due to the defendant\u2019s level of intoxication. It felt serious. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say.", "He is a lifetime sex registrant. That doesn\u2019t expire. Just like what he did to me doesn\u2019t expire, doesn\u2019t just go away after a set number of years. It stays with me, it\u2019s part of my identity, it has forever changed the way I carry myself, the way I live the rest of my life.", "A year has gone by and he has had lots of time on his hands. Has he been seeing a psychologist? What has he done in this past year to show he\u2019s been progressing? If he says he wants to implement programs, what has he done to show for it?", "Throughout incarceration I hope he is provided with appropriate therapy and resources to rebuild his life. I request that he educates himself about the issue of campus sexual assault. I hope he accepts proper punishment and pushes himself to reenter society as a better person.", "To conclude, I want to say thank you. To everyone from the intern who made me oatmeal when I woke up at the hospital that morning, to the deputy who waited beside me, to the nurses who calmed me, to the detective who listened to me and never judged me, to my advocates who stood unwaveringly beside me, to my therapist who taught me to find courage in vulnerability, to my boss for being kind and understanding, to my incredible parents who teach me how to turn pain into strength, to my friends who remind me how to be happy, to my boyfriend who is patient and loving, to my unconquerable sister who is the other half of my heart, to Alaleh, my idol, who fought tirelessly and never doubted me. Thank you to everyone involved in the trial for their time and attention. Thank you to girls across the nation that wrote cards to my DA to give to me, so many strangers who cared for me.", "Most importantly, thank you to the two men who saved me, who I have yet to meet. I sleep with two bicycles that I drew taped above my bed to remind myself there are heroes in this story. That we are looking out for one another. To have known all of these people, to have felt their protection and love, is something I will never forget.", "And finally, to girls everywhere, I am with you. On nights when you feel alone, I am with you. When people doubt you or dismiss you, I am with you. I fought everyday for you. So never stop fighting, I believe you. Lighthouses don\u2019t go running all over an island looking for boats to save; they just stand there shining. Although I can\u2019t save every boat, I hope that by speaking today, you absorbed a small amount of light, a small knowing that you can\u2019t be silenced, a small satisfaction that justice was served, a small assurance that we are getting somewhere, and a big, big knowing that you are important, unquestionably, you are untouchable, you are beautiful, you are to be valued, respected, undeniably, every minute of every day, you are powerful and nobody can take that away from you.

Now, with its brand-new location in Tribeca, Colicchio says the reconceived kitchen set-up will let the orders come out \"much faster.\" Its sandwiches, like the phenomenal BLT, will take an average of \"five minutes as opposed to 12-13 minutes,\" Colicchio said.

This is despite the fact that the U.S. added nearly 2.2 million jobs in 2012.", "\"The big story is that everything was stagnant over the year\" said Economic Policy Institute\u2019s Elise Gould. \"We\u2019re stagnant, and continue to be in a bad place.\"", "While the economy continues to struggle, residents in the wealthiest states continue to make far more than in the poorest. In 2012, Maryland remained the richest state in the country, with a median household income of $71,221. Mississippi was again the poorest, with an income of $37,095 \u2014 nearly half that of Maryland\u2019s.", "Despite the addition of jobs nationwide, median incomes remained stagnant in most states and were still generally below their 2008 levels, adjusted for inflation. Sheldon Danziger, president of the Russell Sage Foundation, explained that this has been the nature of the recovery. \"We have an economy that continues to grow, with most of the gains going to the economic elite. I don\u2019t see any bright prospects for the median worker, much less the poor.\"", "States with lower median incomes generally had much higher rates of poverty than the national rate. All of the 10 states with the lowest median income in 2012 also had among the highest poverty rates in the country. While 15.9% of Americans fell below the poverty line in 2012, nearly one in four Mississippians did.", "Employment is one of the biggest factors affecting income. In some states with lower unemployment, a higher share of the households had steady income, which bolsters the state\u2019s median. In many of the highest-income states, like New Hampshire, Minnesota and Hawaii, unemployment in 2012 was less than 6%, compared to a national rate of 8.1%.", "Elise Gould, Director of Health Policy for Economic Policy Institute, explained that unemployment rates can have a significant effect on a state\u2019s household income. \"When we\u2019re talking about average families and poor families, the vast majority of income comes from wages. So it\u2019s about jobs.\" Gould cautioned, however, that unemployment rates do not tell the full story.", "Unemployment rates, for example, ignore those people who have given up looking for work or accept part-time work. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, while 8.1% of American workers were unemployed in 2012, 14.7% were underemployed, meaning they wanted to work full time but could not. This was an increase from roughly 10% in 2008.", "The types of jobs available in each state also affect income. A review of Census Bureau industry composition data shows that people in most of the states with a higher median income were often more likely to be employed in information, finance, professional and other positions that tend to pay higher salaries. Maryland, the wealthiest state in the country, had the highest percentage of workers in professional, scientific and management positions.", "At the same time, many of the low-income states had smaller percentages of these professional occupations and higher rates of employment in retail, manufacturing and transportation. The high proportion of manufacturing jobs in low-income states might be surprising, but, explained Danziger, the makeup of the manufacturing industry in the country has changed.", "\"There\u2019s a difference between unionized auto company workers and non-unionized parts suppliers,\" Danziger said. \"Even when manufacturers haven\u2019t cut wages, they are adopting labor-saving technological change.\"", "To identify the states with the highest and lowest median household income, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed state data on income from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2012 American Community Survey (ACS). Based on Census treatment, median household income for all years is adjusted for inflation.

What are you willing to struggle for? Because that seems to be a greater determinant of how our lives turn out.", "Everybody wants to have an amazing job and financial independence\u2014but not everyone wants to suffer through 60-hour work weeks, long commutes, obnoxious paperwork, to navigate arbitrary corporate hierarchies and the blase\u0301 confines of an infinite cubicle hell.

And so they settle. They settle and wonder \"What if?\" for years and years and until the question morphs from \"What if?\" into \"Was that it?\" And when the lawyers go home and the alimony check is in the mail they say, \"What was that for?\" if not for their lowered standards and expectations 20 years prior, then what for?", "Because happiness requires struggle. The positive is the side effect of handling the negative. You can only avoid negative experiences for so long before they come roaring back to life.", "At the core of all human behavior, our needs are more or less similar. Positive experience is easy to handle. It\u2019s negative experience that we all, by definition, struggle with. Therefore, what we get out of life is not determined by the good feelings we desire but by what bad feelings we\u2019re willing and able to sustain to get us to those good feelings.", "People want an amazing physique. But you don\u2019t end up with one unless you legitimately appreciate the pain and physical stress that comes with living inside a gym for hour upon hour, unless you love calculating and calibrating the food you eat, planning your life out in tiny plate-sized portions.", "People want to start their own business or become financially independent. But you don\u2019t end up a successful entrepreneur unless you find a way to appreciate the risk, the uncertainty, the repeated failures, and working insane hours on something you have no idea whether will be successful or not.", "People want a partner, a spouse. But you don\u2019t end up attracting someone amazing without appreciating the emotional turbulence that comes with weathering rejections, building the sexual tension that never gets released, and staring blankly at a phone that never rings. It\u2019s part of the game of love. You can\u2019t win if you don\u2019t play.", "What determines your success isn\u2019t \"What do you want to enjoy?\" The question is, \"What pain do you want to sustain?\" The quality of your life is not determined by the quality of your positive experiences but the quality of your negative experiences. And to get good at dealing with negative experiences is to get good at dealing with life.", "There\u2019s a lot of crappy advice out there that says, \"You\u2019ve just got to want it enough!\"", "Everybody wants something. And everybody wants something enough. They just aren\u2019t aware of what it is they want, or rather, what they want \"enough.\"", "Because if you want the benefits of something in life, you have to also want the costs. If you want the beach body, you have to want the sweat, the soreness, the early mornings, and the hunger pangs. If you want the yacht, you have to also want the late nights, the risky business moves, and the possibility of pissing off a person or ten thousand.", "If you find yourself wanting something month after month, year after year, yet nothing happens and you never come any closer to it, then maybe what you actually want is a fantasy, an idealization, an image and a false promise. Maybe what you want isn\u2019t what you want, you just enjoy wanting. Maybe you don\u2019t actually want it at all.", "Sometimes I ask people, \"How do you choose to suffer?\" These people tilt their heads and look at me like I have twelve noses. But I ask because that tells me far more about you than your desires and fantasies. Because you have to choose something. You can\u2019t have a pain-free life. It can\u2019t all be roses and unicorns. And ultimately that\u2019s the hard question that matters. Pleasure is an easy question. And pretty much all of us have similar answers. The more interesting question is the pain. What is the pain that you want to sustain?", "That answer will actually get you somewhere. It\u2019s the question that can change your life. It\u2019s what makes me me and you you. It\u2019s what defines us and separates us and ultimately brings us together.", "For most of my adolescence and young adulthood, I fantasized about being a musician \u2014 a rock star, in particular. Any badass guitar song I heard, I would always close my eyes and envision myself up on stage playing it to the screams of the crowd, people absolutely losing their minds to my sweet finger-noodling. This fantasy could keep me occupied for hours on end. The fantasizing continued up through college, even after I dropped out of music school and stopped playing seriously.

But they weren't.", "It was invading texts, instant messages, email and even in-person dialogue. The slash was being vocalized where it might otherwise appear in written form, integrated smoothly into audible discussion. Since we aren't yet giving other punctuation the same treatment (\"Hello exclamation point\" still sounds odd), it didn't make much sense.", "After so much time being delegated to such boring utilitarian functions as dates (\"8/30/2014\") and fractions (\"3/4 cup\"), the humble slash mark seems to be getting a linguistic makeover. Anne Curzan, professor of English at the University of Michigan, described the practice among students in her classroom last year. Since then, Curzan told me in an email, she's been studying examples of slash usage on Twitter. The most common use corresponds most closely to \"and/or,\" but she said a fair number are \"used to connect one idea to another, perhaps meaning something like 'following up' or as something like a spoken semi-colon.\" Still, other examples use the slash as a way to indicate \"truth values for the elements it connects,\" Curzan explained. In other words, saying one thing when what you really mean is the next. Like saying you need to rest when what you're really planning is binge-watching TV.", "Grammatically speaking, outside of its role as punctuation, the slash also functions as a \"coordinator.\" Coordinators, also called coordinating conjunctions, include \"and,\" \"but,\" \"or\" and other words that function to link independent and dependent clauses.", "English speakers are pretty comfortable with this idea, as Geoffrey K. Pullum, professor of linguistics at the University of Edinburgh, explained on his blog back in 2010. For example, we might invite our friend/roommate to go see \"Boyhood\" while planning to stuff our purse/backpack/pockets with cheap candy. Our meaning is clear. The person with whom we share a responsibility for rent is also our friend, and whatever discreet container we bring to the theater will help us avoid paying five dollars for a box of Sour Patch Kids. The slash helps us present alternative descriptions. Pullum suggested, however, that it really only makes sense in \"lexical rather than phrasal categories.\"", "\"With clauses,\" he wrote, \"I think there is no possibility of using it at all: consider 'I think I'm having hallucinations slash someone is playing tricks on me.' Doesn't seem like English at all, does it?\" These days, many English speakers would disagree. Curzan explicitly noted that the slash can now be used to connect full clauses.", "\"The most interesting implication to me,\" she said, \"is that this coordinator is expanding in use ... and taking on new meanings.\"", "Usage guidelines are, of course, still very restrictive in formal writing. When the style guides and writers' handbooks I consulted mentioned the slash at all, they called it \"rarely necessary.\" A 1977 edition of Theodore Bernstein's \"The Careful Writer\" referred to the simple \"and/or\" as \"a visual and mental monstrosity that should be avoided.\"", "Tell that to anyone who considers themselves a \"slash DJ,\" to indicate their interest in the turntable arts outside of a regular nine-to-five. (Writer-slash-DJ. Financial-consultant-slash-DJ. Animal-whisperer-slash-DJ.) Or to Jezebel editor Kara Brown, who described Robin Thicke's \"Paula\" as the singer's \"most recent album slash lame ass attempt at gaining publicity saving his marriage.\"", "While it'd be difficult to pin down exactly why we started going slash-crazy, it sure seems to correspond nicely with our culture of digital communication. Abbreviated by a lack of time or screen space or both, our technology has allowed instant messaging to flourish, so we might make our always-important thoughts known as quickly as possible.", "The slash works as a stand-in, whether written or spoken, helping the writer express multiple ideas without going through the trouble of stringing them together using appropriate grammar, or else risking a series of awkwardly short bullet-point sentences. However strange \"I'm going for a run slash walk in the park\" sounds to your ear, it gets across the same basic message as the much wordier alternative, \"I'm going to run in the park but probably do a fair amount of walking, too, because running is hard.\" Using \"slash\" assigned more \"truth value\" to \"walk\" over \"run.\" The slash gives us a perfect opportunity to say two or more things at once like this, especially if one or more of those things is our own unsolicited snarky commentary. (\"Friendship slash rivalry.\" \"Review slash indictment.\")", "In digital scenarios where time is of the essence, it might seem counterintuitive that typing \"slash\" in the written form would so often take the place of the shorter and equally comprehensible \"and\" or \"or\" if convenience is such a concern. So maybe it speaks, then, to our comfort with digital communication tools like keyboards and touch screens. Typing is second nature to us, and the slash is an almost mindlessly simple way to link our related thoughts. It's a match made in, um, some factory in China.", "Breakfast slash lunch!

To certain linguists, though, change is actually a great sign. Change means that people are using a language, and using a language keeps it healthy. (There's not a lot of new slang being formed, for example, in Latin.) But everyone owns the English language -- or, maybe, no one does -- and we're not that great at sharing. If it is, in fact, here to stay, some grammar-sticklers will undoubtedly be scandalized at the prospect of a new coordinator, which Curzan called \"a category of words that doesn't often show much creativity and/or admit new members.\"", "Correction: This story has been amended to reflect the correct spelling of Geoffrey K.

Photo via Getty", "Reports on the income inequality gap and the separate lives of the wealthy and the poor have become depressingly rote. The rich are not like you or me: They can buy their way into exclusive clubs, special social networks, even elitist sex parties. The poorest people in America are now on average not making enough to meet their basic needs\u2014that sounds pretty bad, but can I interest you in a $700 juicer?", "In that context, the publication, in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), of a new study that looks at income and life expectancy after age 40 contains no bombshells. The report, covered widely by the New York Times and pretty much every other outlet on Monday, drills down into how income and longevity correlate. The richest 1 percent of men lives, on average, 15 years longer than the poorest 1 percent; for women that gap is ten years. But the ability of money and the things it buys\u2014access to better medical care, leisure time, healthier food\u2014to stave off death is well known. The big finding from Stanford economist Raj Chetty and his seven co-authors is not that rich people live longer, it's that the life expectancies of Americans in poverty varies wildly depending on where they live.", "Here's how the Times summarizes it: \"The poor in some cities\u2014big ones like New York and Los Angeles, and also quite a few smaller ones like Birmingham, Ala.\u2014live nearly as long as their middle-class neighbors or have seen rising life expectancy in the 21st century. But in some other parts of the country, adults with the lowest incomes die on average as young as people in much poorer nations like Rwanda, and their life spans are getting shorter.\"", "For the wealthy, it doesn't matter where they live\u2014they seem to have the access to the same sorts of advantages wherever they go. \"It is as if the top income percentiles belong to one world of elite, wealthy US adults,\" wrote Nobel Prize\u2013winning economist Angus Deaton in an article that accompanied the study in JAMA, \"whereas the bottom income percentiles each belong to separate worlds of poverty, each unhappy and unhealthy in its own way.\"", "The obvious question, then, is what makes those individual islands of scarcity more or less healthy than other communities? That's beyond the scope of the paper, but it's clear that the answer isn't simply that some places have fewer or worse doctors. \"The JAMA paper found that several measures of access to medical care had no clear relationship with longevity among the poor,\" noted the Times. \"But there were correlations with smoking, exercise, and obesity.\"", "The places where the poor lived the longest include New York and San Francisco\u2014rich cities that can afford to provide a lot of services and have proactive public health departments. San Francisco was a pioneer in smoking bans; New York abolished trans fats. Poor people in and around Birmingham had a surprisingly high life expectancy, but there too there has been an investment in health services, according to the Times, and banned smoking in restaurants and other places in 2012.", "Any study like this comes with some caveats. One reason poor people in major metropolises have longer life expectancies could be that they have higher proportions of immigrants, who tend to live longer than native-born Americans. Some people have lower incomes because their poor health damaged their earnings power, not the other way round. And the authors adjusted the statistics for race and ethnicity in order to correct for racial differences in life expectancy (for instance, black people generally live less long than whites), something they've been criticized for. \"Social marginalization is not reducible to single variables,\" wrote Steven Woolf and Jason Purnell in a JAMA editorial. \"Race/ethnicity is inseparable from the economic consequences and stress associated with segregation, past and present marginalization in the distribution of resources, structural racism, persistent poverty, and violence.\"", "But if we accept the broader findings here, there seems to be almost a trickle-down affect when it comes to long life and health. In poverty-pocked areas in the Midwest and the South, poor people die sooner; in other words, in places that lack the services and infrastructure that wealthy big cities usually provide, people are less healthy.", "\"Health is about more than healthcare,\" Woolf and Purnell wrote. Good schools, crime-free neighborhoods, childhoods spared the trauma of family dysfunction, and other factors all contribute to whether someone is happy and healthy as an adult, or whether they're trapped in that old cycle of poverty begetting stress begetting illness begetting more poverty.", "Seen from this angle, inequality looks like not just a matter of unfair numbers but a public health problem. New York's example suggests at least the bones of a solution: higher taxes to fund a local government that develops policies to discourage people from eating crappy food and smoking. In many ways, this is a punishingly unfair city, but when it comes to having a healthy populace, it seems like other places could benefit from some New York values."], "targetTitle": "The One Strange Trick That Will Help You Live Longer: Have a Bunch of Money", "targetDescription": "A new study showed that the wealthy are living longer than the poor\u2014but the size of that life expectancy gap varied wildly depending on where they lived.

The trip was full of surprises: lizards in our suitcase, a couple days on islands with no Wi-Fi (and no English), and days spent doing yoga on the beach to round it all out. But what was perhaps the most baffling part of the whole thing was the one question I was asked again and again from fellow moms: \"Who is watching your kids?\"", "If I were a single mother, the question might be valid. But as a married mom whose husband has an equal hand in raising our brood to adulthood, it's quite astonishing to be asked that question again and again. No, I didn't hire a babysitter (at least not for the nights or weekends). No, I didn't leave them with the grandparents. My husband was with them.", "Why would anyone find this shocking?", "OK, so it's true. The list of daily tasks for the care and upkeep of three children is seemingly endless \u2014 from the moment they leap out of bed between 7 and 7:15 to the moment they hit the pillows around 8 or 8:30. The 2-year-old must be changed, washed, brushed, soothed, fed, held, rocked, amused, and watched multiple times a day. My 9-year-old and 7-year-old have homework to supervise, friend dramas to negotiate, permission slips to sign, and activities to attend. They dress and bathe themselves, but someone must be vigilant at all times to keep them on track.", "Most Popular", "Truth be told, I work part-time, so the bulk of the child duties does fall to me. But my husband knows the score. He is responsible for preschool drop-off every morning. He picks up from gymnastics every Wednesday, and takes charge of math homework and making sure our son reads for exactly 20 minutes every night. He changes diapers and also has access to the giant family calendar that hangs in our mudroom to track everyone's doctors appointments, playdates, birthday parties, and after-school activities. I might be behind the wheel mostly, but he's always next to me in the front seat reading the map.", "So why the question?", "Our society is full of all kinds of families, but our leafy suburb just outside of New York City often feels like there is one kind: traditional two-parent homes where one parent (usually the dad) works full-time while the long-suffering mother does everything with her kids. When I went on a business trip for a week two years ago, a friend confided in me: \"My husband wouldn't even be able to pack a lunch if I left.\"", "Why are we accepting this as normal?", "My husband regularly goes to California for work. Last year, there were long periods where he left every Tuesday and returned on Friday afternoon. Not once, in all those weeks of lonely nights and busy mornings, did anyone ask him who was watching the kids. It's obvious, right? Daddies get to go out in the world. Mommies stay home. Mommy has it all under control. And I do. Mostly. But it's not easy when one spouse travels. A job that really belongs to two people suddenly falls to one. It's a fact my husband understands well.", "This is why I needed a vacation. Alone.", "\"How long are you gone again?\" he texted me on Wednesday, six days into my 11-day trip.", "I had to laugh. But that is all I did. Because I knew that back home, even though he felt like he was drowning, he would doggy paddle his way back to shore somehow. My toddler's cot sheet might not get washed for preschool. And my son might get a B on a spelling test instead of his usual A, because my husband doesn't ride him as hard as I would've if I was home. But my children would be clean, well-fed, and (mostly) smiling when I got back. And they were.", "My husband is not a babysitter. He is a parent just like me. Being alone with the kids is a challenge even for the most organized and dedicated among us. But that doesn't make Daddy less capable of it.", "Upon my return, a friend said she could \"never do what you did.\" Her husband wouldn't be able to keep it together. Not without massive amounts of help. And that's exactly the reason to go. Kids need to know their daddies can care for them as well. Fathers have an equal part in creating them and should have an equal role in raising them.", "So go on. Leave the kids with Daddy. It's good for everyone.

Medically referred to as an onychectomy, declawing a cat is essentially amputation. Feline nails, unlike ours, are attached to their bones. To remove them, vets have to cut through tendon and nerves in order to fully remove the nail and bone. The human equivalent, as the Human Society of the United States describes it, is \"cutting off each finger at the last knuckle.\"", "The gravity of the procedure is why lobbyists are hoping to make it illegal in New York. \"It's the equivalent of taking a cigar cutter and cutting the end joint off,\" veterinarian Jennifer Conrad, who helped lobby for the cause, told a Daily Freeman reporter.

Why would Mother Nature give your cat claws, for you just to pay to rip them out?\"", "Most Popular", "Many cat owners opt for the procedure to avoid a cat's destructive behavior, particularly against their furniture.

This ban marks the first time the issue has reached statewide level in the U.S, the Associated Press reports.", "Meanwhile, many veterinarians understand the concern regarding the procedure, but disagree with a ban. \"None of us love the procedure. But when the alternative is condemning the cat to a shelter or to death? That's why we do it,\" says veterinarian New York City Richard Goldstein.

The college football standout is eligible for the 2014 NFL Draft and is poised to become the first active openly gay player in the league's history. He spoke publicly about his sexuality for the first time to The New York Times and ESPN on Sunday.", "\"I am an openly, proud gay man,\" Sam told ESPN.", "The 24-year-old from Hitchcock, Texas revealed to both outlets that he had come out to his teammates during a preseason football practice before the Tigers' 2013 campaign.", "\"I understand how big this is,\" Sam told ESPN. \"It's a big deal. No one has done this before. And it's kind of a nervous process, but I know what I want to be ... I want to be a football player in the NFL.\"", "A 6-foot-2, 255-pound senior who was voted co-defensive player of the year in the vaunted Southeastern Conference for the 2013 season, Sam made his announcement just two weeks before the NFL Scouting Combine begins on Feb. 22 in Indianapolis.", "\"We admire Michael Sam\u2019s honesty & courage,\" the NFL said in a statement released on Sunday, via Ian Rapoport of NFL.com. \"Michael is a football player. Any player with ability and determination can succeed in NFL.\"", "Sam recounted for The New York Times the moment when he came out to his teammates during a team-building exercise at preseason practice last year.", "\"I looked in their eyes, and they just started shaking their heads -- like, finally, he came out,\" Sam said.", "After coming out to his teammates and coaches during the preseason, Sam starred on the field as the Missouri rolled to a 12-2 record and a 41-31 win in the Cotton Bowl. Given the type of year that Sam had, he was rated as the 12th-best outside pass rusher available in the upcoming NFL draft by ESPN Scouts Inc. and projected to be a mid-round selection. With the NFL's readiness for its first active openly gay player an open question, Sam's draft position will be watched closely in May. Several unnamed NFL personnel members interviewed by Sports Illustrated after Sam's announcement believed that coming out would adversely affect his draft stock.", "\"I don't think football is ready for [an openly gay player] just yet,\" an anonymous NFL player personnel assistant said, reported Pete Thamel and Thayer Evans of Sports Illustrated. \"In the coming decade or two, it's going to be acceptable, but at this point in time it's still a man's-man game. To call somebody a [gay slur] is still so commonplace. It'd chemically imbalance an NFL locker room and meeting room.\"", "The general manager of one NFL team told Peter King of Sports Illustrated that he believed Sam would not even be drafted after coming out. Meanwhile, GLAAD President Sarah Kate Ellis contended that the leadership displayed by Sam should make teams eager to have him on the roster.", "\"By rewriting the script for countless young athletes, Michael has demonstrated the leadership that, along with his impressive skills on the field, makes him a natural fit for the NFL,\" Ellis said in a statement. \"With acceptance of LGBT people rising across our coasts -- in our schools, churches, and workplaces -- it's clear that America is ready for an openly gay football star.\"", "Should any NFL executives or coaches with questions turn to Missouri head football coach Gary Pinkel for answers then they will likely hear about Sam's desire to keep the focus on football and the example he set for this teammates.", "\"We\u2019re really happy for Michael that he\u2019s made the decision to announce this, and we\u2019re proud of him and how he represents Mizzou,\" Pinkel said in a statement. \"Michael is a great example of just how important it is to be respectful of others, he\u2019s taught a lot of people here first-hand that it doesn\u2019t matter what your background is, or your personal orientation, we\u2019re all on the same team and we all support each other. If Michael doesn\u2019t have the support of his teammates like he did this past year, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way he has the type of season he put together.\"", "One of Sam's former teammates at Missouri, Trey Hobson, was also among those expressing support for him on Twitter.", "Shout out to my former Teammate Michael Sam.

His plans were accelerated after unnamed scouts at the Senior Bowl in January were asking about his sexuality.", "\"At the Senior Bowl, it was the first question I got from the scouts almost every time,\" one of Sam's agents, Joe Barkett, told Outsports. \"He didn't feel there was an agenda behind the question other than trying to determine if the word on the Internet was true. \"They would ask about spending time with him, were there girls around? Who is his girlfriend? They didn't ask that about another client, Tom Hornsey. They only asked it about Michael.\"", "Wanting to come out on his own terms, Sam altered his initial timetable, eventually speaking with ESPN and The New York Times on Sunday. After the news broke, Sam took to Twitter to thanks those who helped him in coming out.", "I want to thank everybody for their support and encouragement,especially @espn, @nytimes and @nfl. I am proud to tell my story to the world! \u2014 Michael Sam (@MikeSamFootball) February 10, 2014", "While Sam was thankful for the support he received, Athlete Ally Youth Programs Director Akil Patterson was among those noting the impact that this pioneering decision could have on others.", "\"Having played Division I football as a closeted gay man, I recognize the game-changing potential here for athletes everywhere, \" Patterson, a former standout offensive lineman at the University of Maryland, said in a statement. \"If Michael Sam can navigate this transition into the NFL as an out man of color, it will open doors for young people everywhere, particularly in football. More athletes will feel comfortable being true to themselves at a younger age and that will translate into better performance on the field and in the classroom. I think we have the capacity to go from one trailblazer to a large community of players within a surprisingly short period of time.\"", "Although several former NFL players have come out after retiring and it was widely presumed that there are currently gay players in the league, there has never been an openly gay player. In April 2013, veteran NBA center Jason Collins came out with a first-person piece in Sports Illustrated. The 35-year-old was entering free agency and did not find a new team for the 2013-2014 season. A month later, former U.S. national soccer team player Robbie Rogers became the first active openly gay player in a major professional North American team sport when he stepped onto the field for the L.A.

MAGA!,\" Susie Wiles, Trump\u2019s Florida campaign manager, said in a text message using the acronym for his \"Make America Great Again\" slogan. Her tone was a 180-degree turn from early in the evening when she called the day \"tense and nerve wracking.\"", "Despite Hillary Clinton\u2019s large margins in Miami-Dade County and Broward County, Trump ran up the score elsewhere in the state -- from the Deep South Panhandle to the interior of Florida to peninsula\u2019s southwest, a bastion of working-class whites and retirees from the Midwest who pushed him over the top. Trump ran up huge margins with white Florida voters -- who comprise 64 percent of the state\u2019s voting rolls -- and have always been the most reliable voters in terms of turnout. Latino turnout in Miami-Dade and Orange County was just not enough for Clinton.", "The ups and downs of the campaign had gnawed at Wiles for weeks when she took over following a campaign shake-up that left her in charge of winning must-win Florida without much of a budget to advertise or turn out Republican voters who tend to disproportionately cast absentee ballots by mail.", "In early October, as Hurricane Matthew left part of the state damaged, Wiles realized the campaign had mistakenly not run an absentee ballot program at all. She sounded the alarm and Trump made sure the money was reprogrammed.", "Two weeks ago during a meeting at Trump\u2019s golf club in Doral, sources said, Wiles successfully made the case to Trump to spend more on mail, advertising and paid callers to reach out to more Republican absentee ballot voters. Wiles, who managed Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s first campaign, in 2010, would neither confirm nor deny the accounts.", "The spending was noteworthy because Trump, notoriously tight-fisted with campaign money, believed that campaigns dropped too much money on TV and get-out-the-vote \"ground game\" efforts. Instead, Trump had his outsized personality, his knowledge of Florida \u2013 his second home where he owns the Palm Beach Mar-a-Lago estate \u2013 and his plane that could carry him to any spot on a moment\u2019s notice in Florida, where thousands of supporters materialized for his rallies seemingly spontaneously.", "But even with all of the new Trump spending, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign began to surge. Black and Hispanic voters cast record numbers of absentee ballots and flocked to the early voting polls.", "By Tuesday morning, Democrats felt confident they could ride out the wave of what they knew would be a surge of Republican voters who tend to vote in greater force on Election Day.", "About 1 p.m., one source with Clinton\u2019s campaign said, the Democrats were worried. Republicans were crushing the vote in the Panhandle, Southwest Florida and smaller conservative-leaning counties.", "\"By 5 p.m., our voters showed again,\" the source, not authorized to speak by the campaign, said. \"We felt pretty good.\"", "The size of the vote was historic in populous Democratic strongholds like Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties.", "But turnout was even higher in Republican areas. By the end of the night, Trump\u2019s lead was so big that, even if turnout in Florida was modeled at 80 percent \u2013 far higher than recent elections \u2013 Clinton would still not win if she beat Trump by double digits.", "Clinton\u2019s campaign was almost reduced to a regional effort confined to the southeastern peninsula. She won a stunning 571,000 more votes than Trump in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale media market, one of ten in the state, according to state elections data posted after midnight. She won three lesser markets: West Palm (a 44,000-vote lead); Gainesville (10,000 more votes) and Tallahassee (11,000 more votes).", "Trump blew away records in the Tampa Bay media market, the western edge of the vaunted I-4 corridor that helps swing elections. In the counties composing the market, Trump rolled up a 193,000 vote lead over Clinton. In the Jacksonville market in the northeast, he pulled in 165,000 more votes. He held vote leads of 144,000 in Naples-Fort Myers market, 126,000 in the Pensacola market, 83,000 in the Panama City market and 58,000 in the Orlando market, which anchors the eastern end of the I-4 corridor.", "One of Trump\u2019s pollsters, Tony Fabrizio, said the results showed that Clinton exceeded President Obama\u2019s margins in the Florida markets he won in 2012. But Obama only carried Florida by less than a point.", "\"The difference here is that Trump did far better than Mitt Romney did in almost every county on Election Day,\" Fabrizio said.", "Trump began Election Day down by at least 57,000 votes to Clinton, according to results posted on the Florida Division of Elections website just after the last Florida polls closed at 7 p.m. Central Time. But after that, as Election Day votes poured in, Trump began building a margin that stretched to more than 100,000 by 8:30 p.m.", "By 9:10 p.m., Trump\u2019s margin started to peak at just under 150,000 votes over Clinton. It started to trend down. But not fast enough for the liking of Democrats, who just two hours before were musing about how Trump had lost Florida and therefore the White House.", "\"So goes Florida, so goes the country,\" said Florida\u2019s senior senator, Bill Nelson. \"Look at the Hispanics turning out. Often the Hispanics are registered no party affiliation, but the young Hispanics, they\u2019ll be voting for Hillary.\"", "Nelson and other Democrats also expected Clinton to pad her margin with African-American support.", "But while Clinton rolled up votes with non-white voters, white voters appeared to heavily trend toward Trump. And whites are still a majority of Florida\u2019s voter rolls, 64 percent by registration. And they vote in even greater numbers. Their outsized support counteracted the votes of Hispanics and blacks \u2013 16 percent and 13 percent of the voter rolls, respectively.", "Trump\u2019s strong showing calls into question those who believed his inflammatory comments about immigration reform would ultimately cost him Florida. Trump\u2019s positions put him at loggerheads with the Spanish-language powerhouse network, Univision, which has studios in the same city as his Doral golf club.", "\"My theory is that no one can make it to the WH without the Latino vote. It seems @realDonaldTrump has a different theory. See you Nov 8th,\" Univision pundit Jorge Ramos wrote June 3 on Twitter, repeating his oft-held maxim \u2013 proven wrong in this instance by Trump \u2013 about the power of the Hispanic vote.", "Florida is also a retiree mecca, with one of the oldest populations in the country. And poll after poll showed that the older the voter, the more they liked Trump.", "Most major surveys also showed Trump losing the state \u2013 including exit polls on Election Day.", "\"This was a data defying feat that captured a populist fervor we just couldn\u2019t measure,\" said one Republican pollster who was surprised by Trump\u2019s numbers. \"The Trump campaign kept talking about the missing white voter. Well, they showed up on Election Day.\"", "In myriad ways, Trump succeeded despite the conventional wisdom.", "Trump\u2019s campaign initially didn\u2019t run a robust absentee-ballot program to get voters to fill out and mail back their votes. He delayed advertising on television \u2013 a must for any other statewide candidate. And he refused at times to soften his tone on immigration.", "\"Trump didn\u2019t run a robust program in South Florida targeting the Hispanic community. You could make an argument that his past statements [about immigration and illegal immigrants] made it impossible,\" said Curt Anderson, top adviser to Gov. Scott, the chair of the pro-Trump super PAC. \"But when Gov. Scott won, he did so because he really reached out. If Trump had, we wouldn\u2019t be talking right now. He would have Florida in the bag. Maybe he\u2019ll win because of what\u2019s in the countryside, so to speak, or the Panhandle. But this is really doing it the hard way.\"", "The Florida meltdown is a familiar story for Democrats still scarred by Al Gore\u2019s 2000 loss to George W. Bush in a razor close race. Though Obama won the state twice, both times were by narrow margins built on the strength of his appeal to minority voters in the state.", "But the vaunted Obama machine in Florida was no machine without Obama on the ticket. Now Democrats face a bleak prospect of the coming midterm elections, when liberal-leaning voters tend to stay away from the polls while Republicans keep voting. Sen.

Guess who is."], "postPlatform": "reddit", "targetParagraphs": ["L ast year, ast year, Tesco\u2019s food waste mountain amounted to 59,400 tonnes . If you\u2019re finding that figure hard to envisage, it\u2019s the equivalent of 119m meals, and an increase of 4% on the year before. From this we can deduce that Tesco\u2019s voluble commitment to reducing its edible detritus has yet to yield results. But is Tesco any worse in this respect than any other supermarket chain? Probably wisely, the others don\u2019t publish their waste figures, but let\u2019s just assume that if they had a better story to tell us, we\u2019d already know all about it.", "Tesco\u2019s waste tally is certainly grotesque, but PR executives expert in techniques for smoothing over corporate difficulties would doubtless applaud the masterly way Tesco deflected criticism. On the day that his chain\u2019s depressing results were published, chief executive Dave Lewis addressed a food industry summit where he exhorted food manufacturers to do more to reduce their waste across the supply chain.", "After deftly passing the waste ball back to his supply base, Lewis reprised a favourite supermarket refrain: blame the consumer. \"While the majority of food waste arises from the home, industry recognises the need to lead by example.\" There you have the dramatis personae in Tesco\u2019s food waste script: profligate consumers, suppliers who earn a \"must work harder\" rating, and enlightened Tesco, leading the vanguard in the national war on waste.", "Just in case you aren\u2019t finding the plot line 100% credible, a further emotional strand is woven in: Tesco promises to redistribute all its unsold edible food to charities from 2017. Putting a gloss on your waste problem by repackaging it as a food poverty solution is a tactic increasingly deployed by our major supermarkets. Ideally, from a supermarket PR point of view, the term \"food poverty\" would appear in every headline that contains \"supermarket food waste\", for that allows our giant retailers to bask in the role of philanthropists who use their corporate might for the common good. It places a halo of saintliness around all their business activities.", "But a waste prevention strategy should never be confused with a poverty reduction strategy. Crumbs from the rich man\u2019s table is a shallow, and too easily self-aggrandising response to the unacceptable reality that millions of fellow citizens can\u2019t afford to eat good, fresh food. What\u2019s more, the red herring of food poverty draws attention further away from one essential fact about supermarkets we must digest if we are ever to make any progress: waste is hard-wired into the supermarket system.", "When the supermarkets began colonising the UK grocery market in the early 1980s, they appeared to be a newer, more efficient way of feeding the nation. They promised vast economies of scale by virtue of their collective buying power and state-of-the-art distribution logistics that would bring every agricultural product on the planet to our shelves, 365 days a year. This precision shopping model, we were assured, would produce dividends for consumers in the form of lower prices and more convenient shopping. Who needs parades of small, independent shops when chains can feed us so much more efficiently, and for less?", "Once we sniffed the milk and pared mould off cheese; now we live in dread of food poisoning", "Four decades on, it\u2019s becoming obvious that supermarkets are incapable of delivering this promise. Why? They are retail dinosaurs, locked into a system that\u2019s riddled with problems.", "One such glaring issue is food waste. Far from discouraging it, the supermarket business model actively begets it.", "There aren\u2019t, to my knowledge, any robust statistics on levels of food waste in British households before the supermarket era, but I\u2019d hazard a guess that they were much lower than they are now.", "Our rubbish bins really started filling up when, instead of shopping for a little, as was needed, every day or two, we were persuaded to adopt the one-stop supermarket shopping trip. Theoretically, armed with a list, we could buy all the food we needed for a week. Nowadays, supermarket online ordering makes that even easier to do. Just press the same-as-last-week option. So supermarkets egg us on to overlook what we already have and to buy much more than we need. They encourage us to hazard a weekly guess about what we\u2019ll consume, rather than focusing on what\u2019s in our fridges and larders day-to-day.", "If the untouched remnants of last week\u2019s order are stacking up in the fridge when the supermarket van arrives at our door, most people will consign them to the bin, schooled to believe, thanks to supermarket use by and best before dates, that judging freshness is best left to distant experts. Once we sniffed the milk and pared mould off cheese, now we live in dread of poisoning. Better safe than sorry, surely?", "But sell-by dates \u2013 the progenitor of use by and best before \u2013 were introduced by supermarkets as stock rotation tools, to help clunky, mammoth chains keep tabs on the unprecedented amount of product passing through their system, not primarily as safeguards against food poisoning.", "Undoubtedly, certain foods sold by supermarkets do pose a very real risk to health. Around two thirds of their raw chickens are contaminated with potentially lethal campylobacter at the point of sale, even though they are well within their use-by dates. Yet again supermarkets point the finger of blame at the stupid, sloppy home cook who fails to slay the bacteria through thorough cooking, rather than eradicating infection at their factory farms.", "And don\u2019t forget that supermarkets have actively undermined our national food handling experience and skill by telling us that we\u2019re too \"time poor\" to cook from scratch, largely because it is much more profitable for them to sell us value-added, processed foods whose apparent freshness is validated by reassuring dates.

{"uuid": "7b75a305-11b0-44dd-92f3-267e6c87ff8e", "postId": "516pm8", "postText": ["How Stephen Hawking Has Lived So Long With ALS"], "postPlatform": "reddit", "targetParagraphs": ["An expert on Lou Gehrig's disease explains what we know about this debilitating condition and how Hawking has beaten the odds", "Editor\u2019s Note: Renowned theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking died on March 14, 2018, at age 76. This story, originally published on his 70th birthday on January 7, 2012, is being resurfaced to explain how he beat the odds and lived so long with the disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).", "Stephen Hawking turns 70 on Sunday, beating the odds of a daunting diagnosis by nearly half a century.", "The famous theoretical physicist has helped to bring his ideas about black holes and quantum gravity to a broad public audience. For much of his time in the public eye, though, he has been confined to a wheelchair by a form of the motor-neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). And since 1985 he has had to speak through his trademark computer system\u2014which he operates with his cheek\u2014and have around-the-clock care.", "But his disease seems hardly to have slowed him down. Hawking spent 30 years as a full professor of mathematics at the University of Cambridge. And he is currently the director of research at the school's Center for Theoretical Cosmology.", "But like his mind, Hawking's illness seems to be singular. Most patients with ALS\u2014also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, for the famous baseball player who succumbed to the disease\u2014are diagnosed after the age of 50 and die within five years of their diagnosis. Hawking's condition was first diagnosed when he was 21, and he was not expected to see his 25th birthday.", "Why has Hawking lived so long with this malady when so many other people die so soon after diagnosis? We spoke with Leo McCluskey, an associate professor of neurology and medical director of the ALS Center at the University of Pennsylvania, to find out more about the disease and why it has spared Hawking and his amazing brain.", "What is ALS\u2014and is there more than one form of it?", "ALS, which is also known as a motor-neuron disease\u2014and colloquially as Lou Gehrig's disease in the U.S.\u2014is a neurodegenerative disease. Each muscle is controlled by motor neurons that reside in the brain in the frontal lobe. These are controlled electrically and are synaptically connected to motor neurons that reside lower down in the brain\u2014as well as motor neurons that reside in the spinal cord. The guys in the brain are called the upper motor neurons, and the guys in the spine are called the lower motor neurons. The disease causes weakness of either upper motor neurons or lower motor neurons or both.", "It's been known for quite some time that there are variants of ALS. One is referred to as progressive muscular atrophy, or PMA. It appears to be an isolated illness of the lower motor neurons. However, pathologically, if you do an autopsy of a patient, they will have evidence of deterioration of upper motor neurons.", "There is also primary lateral sclerosis\u2014PLS\u2014and clinically it looks like an isolated upper motor-neuron disorder. However, pathologically they also have lower motor-neuron disorder.", "The other classic syndrome is called progressive baldor palsy\u2014or progressive supranuclear palsy\u2014which is weakening of cranial muscles, like the tongue, face and swallowing muscles. But it pretty much always spreads to limb muscles.", "Those are the four classic motor-neuron disorders that have been described. And it was thought for quite some time that these disorders were limited to motor neurons. It's now clear that that's not true. It's now well recognized that 10 percent of these patients can develop degeneration in another part of the brain, such as other parts of the frontal lobe that don't contain the motor neurons or the temporal lobe. So some of these patients can actually develop dementia, called frontal-temporal lobe dementia.", "One of the misconceptions about ALS is that it's only a motor-neuron disease, and that's not true.", "What has Stephen Hawking's case shown about the disease?", "One thing that is highlighted by this man's course is that this is an incredibly variable disorder in many ways. On average people live two to three years after diagnosis. But that means that half the people live longer, and there are people who live for a long, long time.", "Life expectancy turns on two things: the motor neurons running the diaphragm\u2014the breathing muscles. So the common way people die is of respiratory failure. And the other thing is the deterioration of swallowing muscles, and that can lead to malnutrition and dehydration. If you don't have these two things, you could potentially live for a long time\u2014even though you're getting worse. What's happened to him is just astounding. He's certainly an outlier.", "Has he lived so long because he got the disease when he was young and had the juvenile-onset type?", "Juvenile-onset is diagnosed in the teenage years, and I don't know enough about his course to say. But it's probably something similar to juvenile-onset disorder, which is something that progresses very, very, very slowly. I have patients in my clinic who were diagnosed in their teens and are still alive in their 40s, 50s or 60s. But not having ever examined him or taken a history, it's a little hard for me to say.", "He's a very good example of the sparing of the non-motor parts of the brain that can occur.", "How frequent are these cases of very slow-progressing forms of ALS?", "I would say probably less than a few percent.", "How much do you think Stephen Hawking's longevity has been due to the excellent care that he has received versus the biology of his particular form of ALS?", "It's probably a little bit of both. I just know him from television, so I don't know what kind of interventions he's had. If he really isn't on a ventilator, then it's his biology\u2014it's the biology of his form of the neurodegenerative disease that determines how long he will live. For trouble swallowing you can elect to have a feeding tube placed, which basically takes malnutrition and dehydration off the table. But mostly it's about the biology of the disease.", "Hawking obviously has quite the active mind, and previous statements that he has made seem to indicate he has a pretty positive mental outlook, despite his condition. Is there any evidence that lifestyle and psychological well-being do much to help with patients' outcomes? Or is the disease usually too quick for that to make a difference?", "I don't believe that adds to longevity.", "ALS still doesn't have a cure. What have we learned about the disease recently that might help us find one\u2014or at least better treatments?", "Beginning in 2006 it became clear that like a lot of other neurodegenerative diseases, ALS was determined by the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the brain. Ten percent of ALS is genetic and based on a gene mutation. I'm sure there are also at-risk genes for ALS, but there are now multiple genes that have been identified as potentially causing the disease. Each one of them are interesting in that they lead to the accumulation of different proteins in the brain. Knowing specific genes gives us particular mechanisms in the brain, and would potentially give us targets for therapies. But none of this has given us any robust therapies yet.", "What does Stephen Hawking's case mean for people who have the disease?", "It's just an incredible, incredible example of the variability of the disease\u2014and the hope for patients who have it that they could also live a long life. Unfortunately, it's a small percentage of people for whom that actually happens."], "targetTitle": "How Has Stephen Hawking Lived Past 70 with ALS?", "targetDescription": "50% of people diagnosed with ALS will live about 4 years.

Nighttime exposure to artificial light -- which for the great majority of us happens without much thought or awareness -- disrupts the body's circadian rhythm, altering the 24-hour biological clock that controls our sleep-wake cycle. In addition to wreaking havoc with sleep, disruptions to circadian rhythms also have been associated with a number of serious diseases, including cancer, diabetes, depression and heart disease.", "In particular, research in recent years has shown that blue wavelength light is especially harmful to circadian rhythm function. Studies have shown that blue wavelength light has uniquely harmful effects on humans and suppresses melatonin levels more vigorously than other light wavelengths. Unfortunately, many energy-efficient light sources produce high concentrations of blue light. Blue light is emitted by electronic devices, energy-efficient light bulbs, and other common light sources.", "Research investigating blue-light blocking -- most often in the form of goggles that filter out this particular wavelength of light -- has shown promise. A new study of cataract patients indicates that artificial lens implants can help improve sleep. Scientists at China's Sichuan University studied the effects of blue-light blocking artificial lenses implanted during cataract surgery. The study involved 40 patients who required surgery for cataracts in both eyes. Cataract surgery commonly involves removal of the eye's damaged lens and insertion of an artificial lens. Cataracts are a common condition among older adults -- approximately 60 percent of people over the age of 60 experience cataracts. The study subjects -- 26 women and 14 men, with an average age of 74 -- were given artificial lenses with blue-light blocking capability. Researchers assessed patients sleep quality before surgery and again two months after surgery. They found patients' sleep had improved significantly across several measures:", "Patients were sleeping more during the night.", "Their sleep quality had improved.", "Their levels of daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness had diminished.", "The number of subjects who met the criteria for \"poor sleepers\" had decreased.", "Lens replacement surgery is necessary for cataract patients. But there are other, less-invasive ways to filter out blue-light that are also being investigated by sleep scientists. Research has shown the benefits to sleep of manipulating and controlling exposure to blue light:", "A study of 20 adults who wore either blue-light blocking or ultraviolet-light blocking glasses for three hours before sleep found that both sleep quality and mood improved among those in the group who wore blue-light blocking glasses, compared to the ultraviolet-light blocking group.", "Shift workers are at especially high risk for circadian rhythm disruptions because of their non-traditional schedules. In a study by scientists at Quebec's Universite Laval, nightshift workers used blue-light blocking glasses at or near the end of their overnight shifts for four weeks. At the end of study period, their overall sleep amounts increased, as did their sleep efficiency.", "While nighttime exposure to blue wavelength light is damaging to circadian rhythms, exposure to blue light isn't always detrimental. Daytime exposure to blue light can stimulate alertness and help sleep later on. A study of 94 office workers found that daytime exposure to blue light during work hours resulted in improvements both to sleep and to daytime functioning, compared to exposure to white light. Subjects who were exposed to blue light experienced improvements to daytime alertness, mood, and concentration. These subjects also experienced decreases in daytime sleepiness and they slept better at night.", "This area of research is critically important, and I expect we will see a great deal more investigation into the effects of blue wavelength light on sleep and health. But you don't need special goggles or eye lens implants to protect your circadian rhythms and your sleep from the negative effects of artificial light. Here are some low-tech suggestions that can help you:", "Limit exposure to artificial light in the hours before bed. The last 1-2 hours before bed should be a time of winding down and preparing for sleep. Decreasing your exposure to light is an important part of this process. You don't have to sit in a pitch-black room, but you should think about beginning to limit your exposure to bright lights, whether from your computer screen or your television. Reading under moderate lamplight is fine. If you're using a tablet to read, bring the screen's brightness level down. Make the last 60 minutes of your bedtime ritual electronics-free -- and keep electronic gadgets and devices out of the bedroom altogether.", "Get light exposure during the day. Daytime exposure to light -- both sunlight and artificial light -- can help strengthen circadian rhythms and boost daytime alertness, leaving you better prepared to sleep when the time comes.", "If you need access to light in the middle of the night, use small nightlights. Rather than switching on hallway or bathroom lights -- and flooding your system with melatonin-suppressing light -- use low-illumination night lights to guide you when you need to get up in the dark.", "Being aware of the effects of nighttime exposure to light and making some basic changes to bedtime routines can go a long way toward getting you the darkness you need to sleep well, even in this ever-bright modern age."], "targetTitle": "Blocking Blue Light Helps Sleep", "targetDescription": "The disruptive effects of artificial light on sleep are well", "targetKeywords": "light in bedroom,nightlight,blue light blocking lens,The Sleep Doctor,light exposure,circadian rhythm,electronics and sleep,Sleep Tips,sleep expert,Sleep Advice,bedtime routine,sleep habits,artificial light and sleep,Dr. Breus,blue wavelength,Electronics in Bedroom,blue light,michael breus,sleep,blue light sleep,artificial light sleep,blue light and sleep", "targetMedia": ["http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/Logo_HuffingtonPost-1f66cbef067771f8508930828f764bc8bf8c4b027e58e14e07d207a9f0ce1d31.svg", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rWTZ2PAKL._SL160_.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QKMIg7HvL._SL160_.jpg", "http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/callout_highlight_icon-930f97b89eddc7188ad1c1e0a96bc1359e94a46ea21239c3c5ca3f25c543eaeb.gif", "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1361999/images/o-BLUE-LIGHT-SLEEP-facebook.jpg", "http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/snapchat-QR-56da75d622f38e76ff0d3dec97344808f972f51020435d37d55c6f0e2eaec780.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-703240h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/ShopIndieRed.png", "http://assets.huffingtonpost.com/amazon-sidebar.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "targetUrl": "http://huff.to/1eBEXfW", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "Blue.", "spoilerPublisher": "HuffPoSpoilers"}, "spoiler": ["blue"], "spoilerPositions": [[[1, 55], [1, 59]]], "tags": ["phrase"], "predicted_labels": 1}

The site spits out a seemingly never-ending bucket list of things we absolutely must do before we die: places to see, books to read, urinals to pee in.

Could you actually check everything off the BuzzFeed bucket list, and if so, how long would it take? A little while ago, I set out to find out for myself. Here's how I did it:", "First, I had to compile all of the lists BuzzFeed has published in its \"Before You Die\" format. At the time I filed this story, there were 182 lists. These ranged from appreciating the little things in life (like watching the sunset) to full-blown adventures (like going to South Africa's version of Burning Man). BuzzFeed writers also seem obsessed with food, since practically every other list is about stuffing your face with 21 amazing Aussie burgers or the ten best New Orleans po-boys or the 15 best cheese toasties in London.", "Next, I cataloged each task on each of the 182 lists. There are over a thousand individual tasks.", "On Motherboard: Counting the Hours I've Spent on the Internet", "Next, I calculated the time it would take to complete each of the tasks. This is where it all got slightly more complicated, since the time it would take to do most of these things is highly individualized. Eating fish and chips, for example\u2014how long does that take the average person? If you were really vying for time, you could probably scarf some down in five minutes, but I'd much prefer to spend an hour savoring of a nice, greasy plate. And what if the restaurant was really busy and it took a long time for your server to bring the fish and chips to you? I settled on 30 minutes for eating fish and chips, as well as the other food-related tasks.", "Other tasks required a fair amount of research, like hiking the Camino de Santiago, otherwise known as St. James' path, between Spain and France, which is less like a path and more like a pilgrimage. The trail is nearly 500 miles long. According to the trail's official website, it takes four to six weeks to complete. I decided to allot 30 days to complete the trail, even though the website also noted that you would need to hike 18 miles per day without any rest days to finish the trail in that time, which seems completely insane.", "I repeated this process for every single task on Buzzfeed's lists. Again, there are over a thousand individual tasks.", "Here is a time table showing a small sample of the time I allotted for certain tasks:", "Some of the lists contained fast, easy tasks that be completed entirely from your couch\u2014like this one, which requires you to look at 20 pictures of miniature pigs before you die\u2014but for most of them, you have to travel. Some of the lists, like the Five Highest Places to Visit Before You Die, require you to jet-set from the Haiku Stairs of Oahu, Hawaii to the Petronas Towers of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to the Taihang Mountains in China. In order to accomplish all of the tasks most effectively, you would need to travel the world. So I decided to calculate the travel time that it would take to work your way around the world, in an order most efficient for accomplishing each of the BuzzFeed tasks.", "I decided to begin my hypothetical bucket-list journey in Boston, where I live, and work my way west through North America. I would visit 36 states in the United States and stop in Canada and Mexico along the way. Then onto the Dominican Republic to explore the three shipwrecks of Bayahibe, followed by stops at Turks and Caicos, and Belize. Some stops later, I'd spend 175 hours and ten minutes flying from country to country in Europe, stopping in Estonia to see the beech tree in Hiiumaa before taking a quick ten-minute flight over to Finland to go to the Kontula indoor skatepark in Helsinki. I'd make my way over to Turkey to swim in the crystal blue mineral waters of the Pamukkale Springs in Hierapolis and then pop over to Jordan to grab a drink at the Cave Bar in Petra.", "I whittled the travel time down to one-hour flights over borders, stopping in some countries for only a few minutes to visit a bakery or for a few hours to watch a sports game. In total, the round-the-world trip would take 26 days in travel time alone, and would include 108 countries.", "The last thing I calculated was sleep time. I figured a person would be fairly tired after spending months on end climbing mountains, reading plays, and visiting museums every day, so I allotted the doctor-recommended eight hours per night. I really enjoy sleeping, so this is painful for me to even imagine, but when you're racing to finish an extensive bucket-list in the fastest amount possible, I suppose luxuriating in the REM cycle shouldn't be a priority. I also factored in how long it took me to calculate the trip\u2014around 40 hours in total\u2014and how long it would take to actually book the flights, hotels, and day-trips, which would be possibly twice that.", "In conclusion\u2014drumroll, please\u2014I determined it would take 1,448.7 days to do everything that BuzzFeed says you need to do before you die. That's 207 weeks, or just shy of four years.", "I'll repeat that some of the timing calculations were arbitrary. You could get stuck in a restaurant with poor service and it might take double the time to eat your fish and chips, or you could arrive somewhere like the Trinity Church on King George Island in Antarctica and decide it was too boring to stay the full hour. Your flights could get delayed, or you could get food poisoning at one of the restaurants and choose to bail on the next day's activities. If you got the timing wrong, you might miss the small window when all 39 Christmas markets on the list are open, or arrive at the Mendenhall Ice Caves in Juneau, Alaska, to find that they have all melted.", "But if you planned it just right and you had the time, money, and stamina to accomplish everything on the list, then you could definitely do it.", "That said, I'm not sure why anyone would want to. There are a lot of things on that list that I, personally, have no interest in doing. Why should I visit 39 different Christmas markets across Europe? I mean, I'm sure they're beautiful and each have nice hot chocolate and giant, neon candy canes, but what's the harm in not seeing all 39 of them? Is it really worth the hours it would take to learn all 44 of these air guitar songs? Would I really be a lesser person for not having visited these 19 penis-shaped objects around the world?", "I'm not saying I wouldn't do it. If someone offered me the chance to travel the world and see some of the coolest things this Earth has to offer, I'd be hard pressed to say no. Of course, I'll probably die before that happens. BuzzFeed has a handy quiz for that, too."], "targetTitle": "We Calculated How Long It Would Take to Do Everything BuzzFeed Tells You to Do Before You Die", "targetDescription": "Could you pull it off?

According to new findings from the Pew Research center, 40 percent of marriages involve one spouse who's been married before. In 20 percent of new marriages, both spouses have previously said \"I do.\"", "\"There's so much dialogue right now about the retreat from marriage in general,\" Gretchen Livingston, Senior Researcher at Pew and author of the study, told The Huffington Post. \"I was really curious to juxtapose that with what's going on with remarriage.\"", "Livingston analyzed data from the 2013 American Community Survey as well as the 1960 and 1980 censuses and found that the number of remarried adults in the US has hit 42 million, which is almost double the amount recorded in 1980 and triple the amount in 1960. But not everyone is jumping to remarry -- after combining the hard data on remarriage patterns with the results of a recent Pew survey about marriage, Livingston found that specific demographics are actually less likely to remarry than others.", "Among those who are divorced or widowed, age made a big difference in desire to remarry.", "There are two demographic shifts that can account for this general surge in remarriage, according to Livingston. For one, the divorce rate is higher now than it was in 1960, so the number of people who are, as she put it, \"eligible\" to remarry has also risen. (But it's worth noting that the divorce rate peaked in 1981 and has been slowly declining and leveling off ever since.)", "The more influential factor in the high remarriage rate, however, is a longer life expectancy for partners, particularly among baby boomers. While only 34 percent of those who were 65 and older (and eligible to remarry) had remarried in 1960, 50 percent of that same demographic had remarried in 2013.", "\"The older you are, the more likely you are to have ever remarried, because you have more time in your life to have married once, gotten divorced or widowed and found someone else and remarried,\" Livingston said.", "Younger Americans went the opposite direction: 75 percent of people ages 25 to 34 and eligible to remarry were remarried in 1960, while only 43 percent of that same demographic were remarried in 2013. It's very possible that this younger group of contemporary divorcees and widows hasn't soured on the institution of marriage completely, however. Livingston pointed out that, since younger demographics have tended to delay marriage -- the average age of first marriage is now is about 27 for women and 29 for men, as opposed to 21 for women and 24 for men in 1960 -- perhaps this group is content to cohabit with partners or advance the relationship in other ways, rather than jump into marriage number two.", "Overall, women were less likely than men to want to walk down the aisle again.", "Age wasn't the only differentiating factor, though. When Pew polled participants for the aforementioned survey on marriage, they asked single men and women who had been married before if they would be willing to marry again. There was a clear gender divide: Divorced or widowed men were more likely to want to remarry than women in the same position.", "A majority of once-married, eligible men -- 65 percent -- either expressed a desire to remarry or were still considering it. In comparison, 43 percent of women said they'd be willing to remarry and 54 percent specifically didn't want to ever marry again. Only 30 percent of men were completely against the idea of a second walk down the aisle.", "Previous studies have suggested that men enjoy more health benefits, relationship satisfaction and economic perks from marriage than women do. Livingston said it's quite possible that widowed or divorced men have more motivation to jump back into a new marriage and regain those aforementioned comforts.", "Another interesting finding combined both age and gender: In remarriages, 16 percent of couples involve a husband who is at least 10 years older than his wife. This age gap falls to a mere 4 percent in first-time married couples. If you consider that 39 percent of first-time newlyweds (and 21 percent of remarried couples) are within a year of each other's ages, this age gap among remarried couples becomes particularly noteworthy.", "But don't make too many assumptions about newlyweds -- it's a demographic that's still in flux.", "While today's divorce rate might make newlyweds of the 1960s cringe, that doesn't mean that today's society has lost faith in marriage. In fact, according to Pew, previously married people these days are just as willing to remarry as they were back in 1960. Taken together, these findings can add more detail to an ever-shifting image of the American family.", "\"Maybe newlyweds don't look quite as fresh-faced as they did in the late '60s,\" Livingston said, noting once again that 40 percent of today's newlywed couples involve at least one person who's been married before. \"But I think it's very striking and just another example of how the definitions of family and the norm are changing.\""], "targetTitle": "Pew Report Reveals Who's Likely To Get Married More Than Once", "targetDescription": "Good news for romantics: The divorce rate may be disma...", "targetKeywords": "starter marriage,starter marriages,second marriage,second marriages,second marriage statistics,marriage statistics,starter marriage statistics", "targetMedia": ["http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/Logo_HuffingtonPost-1f66cbef067771f8508930828f764bc8bf8c4b027e58e14e07d207a9f0ce1d31.svg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2322978/images/n-ELIZABETH-TAYLOR-HILTON-628x314.jpg", "http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/callout_highlight_icon-930f97b89eddc7188ad1c1e0a96bc1359e94a46ea21239c3c5ca3f25c543eaeb.gif", "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2322978/images/o-ELIZABETH-TAYLOR-HILTON-facebook.jpg", "http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/snapchat-QR-56da75d622f38e76ff0d3dec97344808f972f51020435d37d55c6f0e2eaec780.png", "http://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/229666/slide_229666_1039035_free.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-703240h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2014/11/ST_2014-11-14_remarriage-07.png", "http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2014/11/ST_2014-11-14_remarriage-04.png", "http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2014/11/ST_2014-11-14_remarriage-02.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "targetUrl": "http://huff.to/1rqzkUw", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "Divorced people", "spoilerPublisher": "HuffPoSpoilers"}, "spoiler": ["According to new findings from the Pew Research center, 40 percent of marriages involve one spouse who's been married before."], "spoilerPositions": [[[0, 88], [0, 213]]], "tags": ["passage"], "predicted_labels": 1}

But the dichotomy is so deeply embedded in our culture that even the most radical activists had been focused mainly on expanding the definitions of the two pre-existing categories.", "Today, a growing number of students are embracing the idea that when it comes to classifying gender, there should be more than two options \u2014 something now afforded by the dating website OkCupid and by Facebook, which last year added a tab for \"custom\" alongside \"male\" and \"female,\" with some 50 options, including \"agender,\" \"androgyne,\" \"pangender\" and \"trans person,\" as well as an option for controlling who can see the customized version.", "Activists on campuses as diverse as Penn State, University at Albany, University of Chicago, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, and University of California, Riverside, are laying claim to a degree of identity freedom nearly unimaginable when the first L.G.B.T student centers were established. Today\u2019s students, who grew up with Gay-Straight Alliances in their high schools, with transgender people represented in the media and with transgender rights percolating through the courts, arrived on campuses already L.G.B.T.-friendly and, in many cases, equipped with gender-neutral housing and bathrooms.", "In hopes of raising consciousness of the biases built into social structures and into the language we use to discuss them, students are organizing identity conferences and inventing new vocabularies, which include pronouns like \"ze\" and \"xe,\" and pressing administrations to make changes that validate, in language, the existence of a gender outside the binary.", "Certainly, there\u2019s a long line of people throughout history whose traits have put them outside norms, and some cultures long ago formalized the existence of a gender that isn\u2019t purely female or purely male, like the American Indian\u2019s two-spirits or India\u2019s hijras. But the binary is a belief system at least as old as Adam and Eve, and most people don\u2019t even realize it\u2019s there. \"It\u2019s like a constant coming-out process, educating those around you that there is a gender binary, and this is what it means to identify outside of it,\" said Gieselman, who works on campus planning gender-related events.", "Identifying as genderqueer is an opportunity to self-invent, unburdened from social expectations about dress and behavior. Occasionally Gieselman wishes for a lower voice and flatter chest, but other times feels O.K. with, even happy about, having a feminine physique.", "\"Even within the same day or the next day I can suddenly really love how my chest looks in a sundress,\" said Gieselman, who wears two small nose rings. In the bedroom closet hang T-shirts, flannels, dresses and a rack of bow ties.", "It might seem a simple turn of events, but adding gender-neutral options to the University of Vermont\u2019s information system took nearly a decade of lobbying, the creation of a task force of students, faculty members and administrators, and six months and $80,000 in staff time to create a software patch.", "One key to the developments is Dorothea Brauer, a plain-spoken, big-hearted mental health counselor known to everyone as Dot. Ms. Brauer spent nine years working at the campus counseling center before becoming, in 2001, the director of what was then called the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning & Ally Center.", "While in her 20s and living in New Jersey, Ms. Brauer, who wears her hair cut short with a single, long braid down her back in tribute to a Cherokee grandmother, was spending time with a woman when an acquaintance changed the course of her life by inquiring about the relationship, and then pointedly but nonjudgmentally asking, \"Honey, are you gay?\"", "\"I said, \u2018Well, yeah, but only with Anita,\u2019 \" recalled Ms. Brauer. (Anita would turn out to be her life partner \u2014 32 years and counting.) \"That\u2019s how clueless I was,\" she said, chuckling over a taco salad lunch at the Penny Cluse Cafe\u0301 in downtown Burlington. \"I was 24, 25, and scared to death. I came out to my mother, only my mother, because I became physically ill with depression.\"", "A decade later, as one of the few out women on campus in the 1990s, she treated students with debilitating identity issues, some of whom attempted suicide or faced a psychotic break. (L.G.B.T.Q. youth are more than twice as likely to attempt suicide as their heterosexual peers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) Ms. Brauer\u2019s first act upon being installed as the center\u2019s director was to assign a graduate student to research and catalog the unmet needs of the transgender community.", "Among the difficulties faced by transgender students: inability to use bathrooms marked \"men\" or \"women\" for fear of a confrontation with a confused classmate; being accused of using a stolen student ID in the cafeteria because the name printed on it didn\u2019t match someone\u2019s gender appearance; and having the faculty rely on a student-information system that listed only legal names, leading to occasions when a student might be embarrassed or inadvertently outed. Ms. Brauer heard about one distraught transgender freshman whose professor, while calling roll, first read the student\u2019s feminine legal name, then announced the male nickname.", "Ms. Brauer reached out to the registrar, Keith P. Williams, who worked with the university\u2019s lawyers to allow transgender students to change their first name in the schoolwide system, but doing so required an in-person visit to the dean of students\u2019 office and filling out paperwork. She then set to work waging a campaign to educate, face to face, members of the faculty, staff and administration on why language sensitivity was so important to a student\u2019s self-respect \u2014 and assisted students in getting school policy amended to specifically prohibit discrimination based on gender identity.", "By 2009, faculty members themselves began pushing for a broader solution to the identification issue, and Mr. Williams created a task force to look into how students could register a preferred first name without having to make a special request. The task force realized that the only way to guarantee a professor would properly refer to a student was to supply the student\u2019s pronoun on class rosters and advisee lists. Then came the question of which gender-neutral pronoun to offer.", "\"Students proposed \u2018they/them\u2019 pronouns, but the faculty vetoed the idea because they said it is grammatically incorrect,\" Mr. Williams recalled. \"They said, \u2018You don\u2019t put a plural pronoun with a single individual.\u2019\" A second option, also being used in various trans communities, was \"ze\" (pronounced ZEE), a riff on the German pronoun \"sie,\" with \"hir\" replacing \"his/her.\"", "Bowing to the faculty, the task force selected \"ze\" and revised its information system, becoming the first school in the nation at which students could select their pronoun. They could also leave the field blank, or opt for \"name only,\" indicating a preference for being referred to by name instead of by pronoun.", "The change fueled gender-awareness campaigns by students all over the country. So many administrators were receiving requests that, in 2012, the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers convened a task force to draft a list of best practices for handling transgender student records.", "So far, about 100 schools now allow students, and sometimes employees, to indicate a moniker other than their legal first name, according to the Consortium of Higher Education L.G.B.T Resource Professionals, and hundreds more have contacted Vermont on how to implement the pronoun choice.", "In September, the university\u2019s pronoun options were expanded yet again to include \"they,\" as grammarians have reminded naysayers that the English language is constantly evolving. Since 2009, 1,891 University of Vermont students have specified a preferred pronoun, with 14 opting for \"ze,\" 10 for \"they\" and another 228 for name only.", "On campuses across the country gender-conscious students have adopted the earnest, P.C. practice of starting social interactions by introducing themselves by name and \"P.G.P.,\" or preferred gender pronoun. (The most semantically obsessed still object to the word \"preferred.\")", "Robyn Ochs, an educator who helped found an early L.G.B.T. faculty and staff group at Harvard, believes that Vermont\u2019s changes are nothing less than lifesaving.", "\"Some people try to reduce this whole topic to kids trying to be cool or they\u2019re just acting out or whatever, just trying to be different or new,\" said Ms. Ochs, who has visited some 500 campuses to speak on L.G.B.T. issues, and often facilitates a discussion she calls \"Beyond Binaries.\" \"But there have always been people who have felt profoundly uncomfortable in their assigned gender roles,\" she said. \"Anything we can do to make them safer, or make them feel recognized, heard, seen, understood, we should do. To validate their identity and experience could, in fact, save their life.\"", "How does one explain to family members what it means to be neither male nor female? Once, at age 15, in conversation with an aunt at the kitchen table, Gieselman tried unsuccessfully to diagram the concepts of gender and sex on a napkin, with gender referring to the attitudes and behaviors a society associates with a person\u2019s biological sex, and sex referring to a person\u2019s biological status (not to be confused with sexual orientation, one\u2019s romantic interests). \"I don\u2019t even know what it was I was trying to show,\" Gieselman, an eighth-generation Vermonter, recounted with a laugh. Gieselman\u2019s grandmother, too, had a few questions about the napkin. \"They were very confused,\" Gieselman said, \"and still are.\"", "Sara Miller, Gieselman\u2019s mother, said that when her teenager first came out to her and offered to provide a pronoun chart for reference, she scoffed.", "\"At the time, it irritated me to no end,\" said Ms. Miller, a social worker. \"I was like, \u2018Really? This is what our struggle is going to be about? Pronouns?\u2019\"", "But Ms. Miller has learned to accept the person her former little girl has become. \"It\u2019s grown out of the process of really seeing how Rocko has grown as an individual and an adult, seeing how Rocko is their own person, and not a child,\" Ms. Miller said. \"This is how they presents themself to new friends and colleagues and employers and students. That group knows Rocko only that way.\"", "Although Ms. Miller tries her best to always use \"they/them\" pronouns, she often slips up, but Gieselman isn\u2019t bothered. \"Rocko and I have an understanding. She knows I try,\" said Ms. Miller, slipping up again.", "At last summer\u2019s orientation for new faculty members, Ms. Brauer handed out pocket-size pronoun charts created by the L.G.B.T.

It sits in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, orbiting the sun at a distance almost 46 times farther away than Earth and completing an orbit once every 310 Earth-years. Recent observation by the Hubble Space Telescope, however, has revealed that Makemake is not as lonely as it once appeared: it has a moon.", "Finding a Dark Moon", "Until this new discovery, scientists believed Makemake was the only one of the four officially recognized dwarf planets in the Kuiper belt (Pluto, Haumea, Makemake and Eris) without a moon - the fifth official dwarf planet, Ceres, is closer to Earth and also moonless. However, there were some inconsistencies in prior measurements of Makemake\u2019s light and heat. Observations from the Spitzer and Herschel space telescopes revealed warm, dark areas on Makemake\u2019s otherwise bright, cold surface. However, Makemake\u2019s apparently mottled surface would not make sense with a normally rotating dwarf planet unless it was spinning with one of its poles facing directly toward Earth, a fairly unlikely situation. The \"dark moon hypothesis\" offered a simpler explanation: a charcoal-black moon orbiting Makemake. \"Imagine that the dark material isn\u2019t on Makemake\u2019s surface... it\u2019s in orbit!\" image analysis lead and paper coauthor Alex Parker tweeted. \"If the moon is very dark, it accounts for most previous thermal measurements!\"", "Makemake is the second-farthest away of the official dwarf planets (Eris is the farthest) and the second-brightest (after Pluto). While it may seem strange that astronomers had been able to see moons around farther and dimmer planets while missing Makemake\u2019s moon, the reality is that this moon, informally called MK2, was very good at remaining hidden.", "MK2 is over 1300 times dimmer and much smaller than Makemake, and its orbit appears to be edge-on to Earth, so we don\u2019t see it circling Makemake, only oscillating back and forth. Looking for it is like looking for a firefly flitting back and forth across a spotlight. If you watch it long enough and are lucky enough to look at the right time, as this team of astronomers did, the firefly might look obvious (in Parker\u2019s words, \"not actually that faint\"), but it was easy to miss before.", "Part of a team from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, Parker was the first to notice Makemake\u2019s moon in data from the Hubble Space Telescope. At first, he", "thought someone else must have already seen it. Just to be sure, he asked collaborator and team leader Marc Buie, \"Has anyone seen the moon in the Makemake data?\" When Buie replied, \"There\u2019s a moon in the Makemake data?\" they knew they\u2019d made a major discovery.", "The Moon in the Data", "It is unclear where exactly the moon came from or why its surface is black. More observations of MK2 from Hubble will help astronomers determine whether its orbit is circular or elliptical, which will provide clues to its origin. If MK2\u2019s orbit is elongated, it was probably simply captured in Makemake\u2019s gravity as it floated by. Many smaller Kuiper Belt Objects have dark surfaces like MK2. This is often because they are too small and their gravity too weak to keep bright ices (like the ones that cover Makemake) in place.", "However, MK2\u2019s darkness could be due to constant interactions with the escaping atmospheric gases streaming off Makemake: like the top of a hearth blackened with ash, it could have accumulated compounds from Makemake\u2019s past atmosphere. If MK2\u2019s orbit is circular, as preliminary estimates indicate, the moon may be merely debris from a collision between Makemake and another Kuiper Belt Object. If MK2 was created by an enormous crash between two Kuiper Belt Objects, according to the paper, \"The apparent ubiquity of trans-Neptunian dwarf planet satellites further supports the idea that giant collisions are a near-universal fixture in the histories of these distant worlds.\" If all of the dwarf planets have satellites (moons), that may mean that Kuiper Belt Objects are often subjected to huge impacts.", "The New, Improved Makemake System", "While MK2 does create questions about the Makemake system and the Kuiper Belt, it will also provide answers. According to Parker, \"The discovery of this moon has given us an", "opportunity to study Makemake in far greater detail than we ever would have been able to without the companion.\" ", "Makemake is sometimes referred to as \"Pluto\u2019s little sister\" because of their similarities: both are dwarf planets, both have surfaces coated in methane ice, and both have temperatures that can drop to -400 degrees Fahrenheit. The discovery that Makemake has a moon adds yet another similarity to Pluto. When Pluto\u2019s largest moon, Charon, was discovered in 1978, it led to enormous new insights about Pluto itself, including that it was hundreds of times lighter than was originally estimated. \"That's the kind of transformative measurement that having a satellite can enable,\" Parker said: MK2 will almost definitely lead to a fundamental change in how we view the dwarf planet Makemake.", "Looking at how MK2 orbits Makemake will allow scientists to calculate the system\u2019s mass and probe its inner composition. As Caltech\u2019s Mike Brown, a member of the team that discovered Makemake in 2005, said, \"The wide range of densities of the dwarf planets is one of the most interesting mysteries out there.

The Professional Golf Association (PGA) has decided to not hold their PGA Tour event at Miami\u2019s Trump Doral resort.

Being unable to replace one, especially for a popular golf tournament with international reach and a half-century of history, defines uncommon. Even in the economically stretched times of 2009-10, the PGA signed lucrative sponsor agreements.

Golf\u2019s professional bodies have worked long and hard to integrate their sport into America\u2019s mainstream majority of tolerant society, the sport having started at member\u2019s only golf clubs which used to exclude women, African-Americans, Latinos and Jews from many private courses. So it only makes sense that they\u2019re following NBC\u2019s lead in firing the shameless race-baiter from hosting one of golf\u2019s top events now that he\u2019s hurting the sport\u2019s cash flow with his radioactive remarks.", "The presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s golf resort business is going to be awfully lonely once six more months of his endlessly crass remarks of intolerance and hatred get plastered across the internet.

No problem. The clean and classy look works very well here too!", "Pop culture and the media has a huge influence on how men sport their hair, so it's no surprise men emulate the hairstyles of their favorite musicians and celebrities to reflect the times. They even find inspiration from past trends, making everything old, new again. TV shows like Mad Men brought back the Don Draper cut, with tightened sides and a sharp part on the left side of the head that was typical among business professionals in the late 60s.With a population of roughly 318 million people here in the U.S., there is a huge range of styles and opinions when it comes to haircuts. But which is the cut that gets requested the most? GQ recently asked 500 barbers and stylists across our nation for the top three most requested haircuts. Their expectations about haircut preferences varying by region were...cut short. Before revealing the most requested haircut, here's a look at what's not on the top of everyone's list. Perhaps the mullet dominates in Kentucky or Oklahoma. Popularized by musicians like Rod Stewart and David Bowie (RIP), the mullet was predominant as far back as the early 70s. Some guys prefer to stay stuck in the era of disco. Still, it is not a popular haircut. No judgment here. You do your 'do the way you do!Perhaps the buzzcut is favored more in Iowa.Sadly, the buzzcut lacks the length of hair enough to be sweeping the nation. Maybe the Southwest prefers the Caesar's cut.None of these styles were in hot demand. But when all the data was compiled, there was one haircut that was consistently favored among men from Schenectady to Cincinnati, Portland to Nashville, Juneau to NYC, and every city in between. So which cut made the cut? There's no official name for the style, but it's basically the 'undercut,' long on top and short on the sides. The clean-cut style of a longer crown with a clipper cut fade on the sides won out as the preferred cut of choice. The prime example of the desired haircut is sported here by one of the most desirable men in Hollywood: Ryan Reynolds.The style is easily adaptable for both casual and formal occasions. This haircut works with most types of hair, including thick, wavy and curly hair. Want the same haircut? GQ shares how to ask your barber for the popular cut:The popular style is also easy to maintain, and there are plenty of options to play with.The word is out. This is the nation's popular haircut for now. But how long can it last? Will barbers be forever shearing this time-transcending method of the undercut, or will the style last as briefly as a cheap bottle of Dep gel? Time will tell, but since it's summer, it's gotta feel wonderful to clipper-cut the sides of your head. Your head will feel cool in the summer heat, and you'll be looking even cooler!

With the adoption of modern lifestyles, men, too are becoming infertile these days.", "A renowned gynecologist and infertility and in vitro fertilisation specialist, Dr. Sonia Malik, at one of the leading fertility treatment centres in New Delhi, stated that 46% of Indians, between the ages of 31 and 40 years, need medical intervention to conceive. This is because one or both partners in the relationship are suffering from fertility problems. Another city gynaecologist named, Dr. Yashica Gudesar, said one of the main reasons causing infertility is polycystic ovarian disorder in women and reduced sperm count in men.", "Studies also suggest that it is wrong to blame the women all the time for being infertile. Statistically, in nearly 30% of all infertility cases, men have been found to be infertile, as per Society for the Study of Male Reproduction.", "Some of the reasons that doctors have stated for this problem is irregular working hours and work stress in the IT, media industry and BPOs. Apparently, constant use of Android or iPhone affects sperm count as they have higher emission rate. Environmental pollution also to some extent contributes to low sperm count. The food you eat and your sleeping patterns have also found to affect the quality of sperms and eggs these days. Moreover, men who smoke cigarettes regularly are at an increased risk of infertility says, Dr. Ved Prakash.", "But dear men, worry not! There is a solution to every problem. And while cutting down on your smokes and adopting a better lifestyle is one of them, it\u2019s not the only one. IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection offers a good chance of pregnancy. Nowadays, people are becoming more open to consulting IVF centers for problems relating to infertility such as erectile dysfunction, or not being able to have a child. However, the treatments aren\u2019t very budget-friendly. The minimum a couple spends on this is Rs. 1 lakh, which could be a matter of concern to a lot of individuals.", "It\u2019s okay to believe in the concept of YOLO, but what\u2019s the point if it\u2019s not going to give you all the happiness you need to live happily?"], "targetTitle": "Research Reveals Indian Men Are Becoming Infertile.

And as a Clinton aide pointed out, the African-American share of the vote in the district is higher than the statewide average\u2014and Clinton has shown she consistently over-performs among black voters.", "The electoral college\u2019s winner-take-all system means that reliably Democratic states like Massachusetts and Oregon\u2014or reliably Republican states like Texas and Alabama\u2014are never seriously contested by presidential candidates.

It\u2019s one of his worst yet."], "postPlatform": "Facebook", "targetParagraphs": ["THE MORNING PLUM:", "Believe it or not, Donald Trump has now made a very important policy statement. Introducing what he billed as an \"energy plan,\" Trump promised to \"cancel the Paris Climate Plan.\" Unlike so much of what comes from Trump on policy, this is a genuinely clarifying moment, with potentially enormous long-term implications.", "The near-term political consequences of this will \u2014 or should \u2014 be that there is now no chance whatsoever that Bernie Sanders will do anything at all on his way out that could imperil party unity in a way that makes a Trump victory more likely. I don\u2019t believe Sanders has any intention to do that, by the way, but this should theoretically render it an impossibility in his mind, because it dramatically increases the stakes for a relatively smooth resolution of the Democratic primaries. Indeed, I believe it\u2019s likely Sanders will see it this way, too.", "To get all the details on Trump\u2019s full energy plan, read Brad Plumer\u2019s piece. Trump would pursue a mostly standard-issue GOP agenda of \"fewer regulations and more fossil fuel production.\" More important, with some reporters wondering what Trump\u2019s actual views are on global climate change, he clarified them: He is utterly indifferent to its existence and would roll back the main things we\u2019re currently putting in place to deal with it.", "Trump said that the current environmental challenges that the Obama administration is trying to tackle are \"phony.\" He added that he would \"rescind\" the EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan, which would curb carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal-fired power plants, and is key to the U.S.\u2019s ability to meet its commitments as part of the global climate deal. He would withdraw the U.S. from participation in that global accord.", "As I\u2019ve reported before, there are complexities that could make it harder than expected for a Republican president \u2014 even one as masterfully competent and strong as Trump \u2014 to roll back the Clean Power Plan and/or withdraw from the Paris climate deal. But it\u2019s possible that Trump could accomplish one or both of these, which would be a tremendous setback.", "This deepens the contrast between Trump and Hillary Clinton. While Clinton would not be as ambitious as Sanders in tackling the climate challenge, the unalterable fact of the matter is that Clinton would preserve and implement the Clean Power Plan and the global climate accord, and Trump would seek to reverse them both.", "Sanders has repeatedly described the climate challenge as the single greatest long-term threat we face:", "Climate change is the single greatest threat facing our planet. \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) April 7, 2016", "And:", "As a father of four and a grandfather of seven, I care about leaving a healthy, livable planet for all of our kids and grandchildren. \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) April 7, 2016", "It\u2019s true that Sanders has criticized the global climate deal as insufficient. But Sanders surely knows that continuing to implement it \u2014 and the Clean Power Plan \u2014 are infinitely preferable to rolling them back, which could lay the groundwork for catastrophe. Sanders knows that the Paris accord may end up being our best near term hope for building an international effort to tackle the climate problem. Implementing it could allow us to get to the point where dramatic innovations in energy technology begin to make solving the problem a realistic possibility. What\u2019s more, even if the Paris accord is currently not enough, it can be built upon later. The accord is not guaranteed to succeed, but trying to implement and build upon it makes success more likely. Obviously, if our participation in it is canceled, building upon it is no longer possible.", "It is often said that Sanders may not help to unify the party because he has \"nothing to lose\" from a Democratic loss. I think that is wrong \u2014 I believe Sanders when he says a Trump presidency is unthinkable. And at any rate, the incentives, if anything, favor Sanders helping to unify the party, in order to maximize his and his movement\u2019s influence going forward. Trump has now clarified beyond any doubt just how much, by Sanders\u2019 own lights, we all have to lose from a Trump presidency. My bet is Sanders will seize on this to make the case to his supporters that the stakes in this election require a full commitment to Trump\u2019s defeat, even if that means supporting a flawed alternative."], "targetTitle": "Donald Trump just made an extremely important promise.

Ask any true Roman about it and you'll be met with a befuddled \"who is-a Alfredo?\" That's because, fellow Americans, Roman children didn't grow up scarfing down plates of this creamy comfort food like we did here. (Then again, Olive Garden has yet to hit Mediterranean shores.) Alfredo, after all, isn't found alongside carbonara and amatriciana in the pantheon of celebrated local dishes\u2014not because it isn't Roman, but because it never spread throughout the city. Its origins lay in a single, no-name trattoria on a side street near the Trevi Fountain. In the early 1900s, the eponymous Alfredo di Lielo needed a calorific meal to feed his pregnant wife. So he combined butter and cheese and melted it over fettuccine noodles. Sated, his wife insisted he add it to his menu.", "But it remained a strictly of-the-house specialty. Despite the acclaim (rumors swirl that Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks ate it on their Roman holiday in 1927), other trattorias likely rejected it due to inauthenticity. Alfredo used parmigiano for the cheese (a bold move in Pecorino Romano country) and butter, which was pretty much as foreign an ingredient to Italians at the time as milk was to the Japanese. But it did take off stateside thanks to a Pennsylvania noodle company: Pennsylvania Dutch marketed a creamy sauce called Alfredo after influential New York restaurateur George Renart raved about the dish in the Saturday Evening Post when he returned from a trip to Rome. The version we eat now\u2014loaded with cream, often with chicken\u2014is a bastardization of what Alfredo cooked up a century ago. And it's definitely not what you would find in Rome now, even if those trattorias from Testaccio to Prati had Alfredo on the menu (which they don't).", "Should we just quit the search and make do with carbonara instead? Local food expert Elizabeth Minchilli says no way. \"I always encourage travelers to seek out Alfredo in Rome,\" she says. \"You just need to know where to go.\" That would be Trattoria della Scrofa, between Piazza Navona and the Trevi Fountain, a 103-year-old restaurant that Alfredo started after his first spot was flattened to make space for a shopping center. What you\u2019ll get is a heaping plate of pasta prepped as Alfredo did it all those years ago: hot noodles, on a hot plate, mixed with (lots of) softened butter and (lots of) grated parmigiano right at your table. What you won\u2019t get is cream, garlic, or an overwhelming crush of travelers.

Photo: Tom Johnson", "This post originally appeared on VICE UK.", "Good Cop, Bad War is the story of an undercover police officer, Neil Woods, who spent over a decade infiltrating Britain's biggest drug gangs. The book , released last week, provides a unique insight into a world of mind games and violence, where the drug trade acts as a production line for the creation of ruthless gangsters. Ultimately, his experiences led Woods to reject the way drugs are policed in the UK.", "\"The logic of the drugs war only leads one way: the police get smarter, so the criminals get nastier; things can only ever go from bad to worse, from savagery to savagery,\" says Woods. Now, after having left the force, he is chairman of LEAP UK (Law Enforcement Against Prohibition), a pro-drug legalization activist group consisting of ex-law enforcement officials.", "But to what extent are Woods and his colleagues at LEAP UK\u2014and those currently employed in the police force\u2014rare specimens? How thin on the ground are drug cops who think they are fighting the wrong fight? Expressing sympathy for anything other than hardline prohibition\u2014even to their colleagues\u2014is something of a risk in the black and white, \"them and us\" world of police culture.", "Even so, every now and then drug cops open up about the realities of clearing the streets of dealers and drugs.", "\ue605 Neil Woods buying crack while undercover in 1995. Photo courtesy of Neil Woods", "I spoke to Mike Fisher*, a senior drugs investigator for Britain's organized crime busting bureau, the National Crime Agency (NCA). He asked for his name to be changed to avoid disciplinary action, as his views will definitely not be found anywhere near the pages of the NCA's annual report.", "\"If the NCA stopped targeting drug gangs, it would change nothing,\" he explained. \"You would see little change in the high street. Society would not collapse. As it is, drugs are freely available now. All that would happen is that dealing would be more open. But it may give us more of a chance to deal with crimes such as homicide.\"", "On the surface, it's a counter-intuitive line to take for a senior officer working within an agency for which the drug trade is a key target.", "\"Law enforcement against drugs is completely ineffective and has been since the Misuse of Drugs Act came into force in 1971,\" says Fisher. \"The idea of the state protecting you from yourself just doesn't work. We've spent billions of pounds trying to prohibit drugs, but there's less chance of it working than Canute stopping the waves.", "\ue605 Photo: Andoni Lubaki", "Fisher tells me that arresting people on the streets for drugs is an endless cycle, and that it's the same with the larger fish. \"Whenever we remove a big guy, someone else\u2014usually a lieutenant\u2014replaces him within days. The more we try, the harder it gets: increased enforcement keeps these people looking over their shoulder; they become more covert about their activity, and that makes our job harder.\"", "Fisher's solution is to take the Portugal route: decriminalize personal use of all drugs, from cannabis to heroin, and look at legalizing production and supply. \"I believe consenting adults have a choice as to what they put in their bodies. It will also make it easier for heroin and crack users to get the help they need and free up police time to go out on patrol and deal with other crimes,\" he says. \"Ideally, production should be wrested from organized criminals and managed by governments.\"", "Surprisingly, he tells me around half of Britain's elite drug detectives at NCA have similar \"liberal\" attitudes to the drugs problem.", "But what about those drug cops working below NCA level, in towns and cities across the UK? To gauge what they truly think about their daily task, you need to be a fly on the wall\u2014so that's the exact position that University of Sheffield criminologist Dr. Matthew Bacon took. He spent two years embedded with drug detectives in a town and a major city (the identities of which are secret) in the UK and wrote about his experiences in Taking Care of Business , published last month.", "Most officers were anti-drugs and fully supported prohibition. Drugs were seen as being behind all that's bad in society. This gave them a \"righteousness\" in their actions, observed Bacon. But within this, recreational drug users, social dealers, and nightclubs were far less of a crime problem than alcohol, a drug which few officers had a problem with.", "It's perhaps not surprising, given the police's moral code, that most of the officers he hung around with viewed \"junkies\" as lazy, undeserving scumbags. In 2012, a former undercover officer who disguised himself as a heroin user-dealer, told me: \"It made me realize how bad cops can be to drug addicts. I was abused, assaulted, and threatened with being fitted up by having drugs planted on me on a regular basis.\"", "To the anti-drug teams Bacon shadowed, heroin dealers were one of the most despised groups in society, so much so that they were seen as \"police property\"\u2014objects that police could do with as they wished. \"Almost without exception, dealers were depicted as deplorable and dangerous outlaws,\" says Bacon. \"They were made the scapegoat of the drug problem.\"", "\ue605 Photo: Marco Tulio Valencia", "Drug cops, who saw themselves as \"elite crime fighters,\" had sufficient respect however for the the Mr. Bigs of the drug world. They saw those who ran professional outfits and had families at home as worthy adversaries, and a \"good collar\" for which they would earn respect among their colleagues.", "Despite all this, there was acceptance\u2014often expressed by officers off-duty after a few pints\u2014that they were not waging a \"war on drugs,\" but managing an unbeatable problem in order to \"keep the public happy.\"", "One detective sergeant told Bacon: \"Sometimes I think we're like those [Japanese] soldiers in World War II\u2014you know, those ones on the island who just kept fighting because they didn't know the war was over. Only difference is, we'd lost the war before we even started fighting.\" Another officer told him: \"We've thrown everything at it, even the kitchen sink, but drug problems just keep getting worse. In the end, the drugs are still on the streets, no matter how many people we lock up.\"", "There are rebellious notions even among the rank and file. When I went stop and searching in Soho with one of the Met Police's sniffer dog teams in 2013, I was surprised to hear from a regular beat officer and his colleague that they thought cannabis should be legalized entirely. \"I say legalize the lot,\" one said. \"Legalize it and tax it,\" said the other. \"If someone wants to turn the sky green and the grass blue, then it's up to them. I can't see the difference between alcohol and cannabis. The official line is that drugs are under control, but they are not.\"", "I call up Simon Kempton, a police sergeant from Dorset who has specialized in drug enforcement and sits on the National Board of the Police Federation, a body that represents rank and file officers. He agrees with Woods\u2014that the drug trade houses the most violent people in the country\u2014but believes prohibition is crucial to taking them out.", "\"I can't speak for everyone, but in my opinion drug policing is worthwhile, all day, every day,\" he says. \"I get it: it can seem futile when we take out someone knocking out kilos of cocaine, [who's] replaced within two hours. But the reason it's worth doing is because the drug is not just about the drug trade: it's weapons, terrorism, people trafficking, money laundering; it straddles the spectrum of the most serious crimes, such as murder, kidnapping, serious assault\u2014which all go hand in hand with the drug trade.", "\"We are taking out the worst people in our society. When they assault people it's not just a punch-up outside a pub; we are talking about sending a message through retribution and torture. These people have to protect their trade from others, so they use extreme levels of violence. You have to be the scariest, biggest person on the block, otherwise they will take your money from you.", "\"Undercover police officers would not take the huge risks infiltrating gangs if they did not think it was worthwhile. Undercover drug policing is not cheap, but it's very cost effective. It's rare to get a not guilty after undercover work because of all the evidence that's been gathered. Yes, people can feel demoralized that they've put themselves on the line, and then someone ends up getting just a coupe of years, but that's the way it is sometimes.\"", "However, Sgt Kempton said that for rank and file officers, policing cannabis was another matter, and that many officers sympathized with the path taken by Durham Police in going easy on low-level cannabis offenses : \"With dwindling resources, forces are having to focus their limited numbers on areas which represent the greatest harms to wider society. While policing cannabis is still a legitimate action, I believe most officers and the public would support a focus on other areas of crime.\"", "Over the years writing about the drug trade, I've met drug cops who have told me that their job is similar to that of the drug user or trafficker\u2014a series of almost addictive drug bust \"hits\" that perpetuate the game.

As of this writing, The Shawshank Redemption is sitting atop the IMDB rankings of the most popular movies of all-time. The film is truly beloved today. However, that wasn\u2019t always the case. While the film was critically praised upon its release, it was a commercial failure. Nobody saw it in the theaters, and most fans found it on home video or cable later. Morgan Freeman thinks that a large part of the reason the movie did so badly at first is because the title is awful.Appearing on Late Night With Seth Meyers , Morgan Freeman says he knew thatwas a great film as soon as he read the script, and that he was willing to play any role just to be in it, but if there was one thing he could have changed about it, it was the title page.While the original title of Stephen King\u2019s novelladoesn\u2019t do any better job telling you anything about what the movie actually is, Morgan Freeman has a point that at least that version has the name of a famous movie actress included, which is something people will recognize. Shawshank, the name of the prison where the film takes place, is a meaningless word by itself. Morgan Freeman jokes in the interview that many people would mispronounce the word, even while telling him how much they loved the movie.Hearing that the reason the title was shortened was so that it could fit on theater marquees is almost quaint. Today, few theaters still have marquees that you can see without standing in front of the ticket window, and the amount of space given to each title is such that even titles much shorter thanend up getting cut off. Morgan Freeman makes a good point, that by doing the title his way, the part that you see has Rita Hayworth\u2019s name, which is something, although it\u2019s possible the studio was afraid people would think the theater was showing old movies.While we\u2019ll never know if the title change would have meant earlier financial success for The Shawshank Redemption we do know that the title they chose didn\u2019t help.

When I got my results back I was not surprised. There were no big revelations and, just as I suspected, I am not related to royalty. But I did wonder if I could learn anything more from the DNA report. That search sent me down a rabbit hole that lead me to the story of Michael Usry Jr., a young filmmaker who became a suspect in the Angie Dodge murder investigation.", "After getting my DNA report I learned that there are a number of genealogy sites, educational institutions and companies that are willing to offer you further insight into what your DNA may reveal, as long as you\u2019re willing to upload your DNA profile to them. Some of these sites charge money, while others are simply willing to analyze your DNA profile in exchange for adding your profile to their database. I probably uploaded my profile to about four sites. One told me the type of workout supplements I should be taking, another searched public family trees for family connections. There was even one that promised to create a diet tailor made for me based on my DNA. I gave no thought to how my profile could be used by these companies or institutions down the road.", "Then I heard that the New York City Police Department was trying to get permission to do something called a \"familial DNA\" search. What does that mean?  Police hunting for a killer in a high-profile murder case wanted to use his DNA to search New York State\u2019s criminal database for a relative of his. They had already searched for the killer, but he was not in the database. If they could find someone related to him they would have a family name, making it easier to track down the killer.  A quick search of the phrase \"familial DNA\" and I learned authorities in California had used it to apprehend a serial killer, who had eluded them for 25 years. The infamous \"Grim Sleeper,\" Lonny Franklin Jr., had a son who was serving time on a felony weapons charge, and his DNA had been uploaded to the California criminal database. A familial search connected father and son, allowing police to finally make an arrest.", "A little more searching and I stumbled across a blog post about a young filmmaker named, Michael Usry Jr. A familial search conducted by Idaho Falls police landed Usry in a stark interrogation room, where he was grilled by detectives and asked for his DNA, without any explanation. I tracked Usry down on Facebook and asked him to call me. When we finally spoke, he told the whole story. How his father had participated in a genealogical study through their church, giving a sample of his DNA to a public database, which was later purchased by Ancestry.com. Years later, in an attempt to crack the 20-year-old cold-case murder of Angie Dodge, police conducted a familial DNA search in that very database, and found an anonymous donor who appeared to be a very close match to the killer\u2019s DNA. After obtaining a search warrant for Ancestry.com to reveal his name, detectives learned it was a man named Michael Usry Sr. When cops built out his family tree they found Usry had a son. Cops tracked him down and began investigating.", "As I talked with Michael Usry, he told me he was very angry about being caught up in the investigation, but he was even angrier about something else. There was a man serving time for Angie\u2019s murder, Christopher Tapp, who Usry believes is innocent.", "After I hung up the phone, I started researching Angie Dodge\u2019s murder and the case against Chris Tapp. I learned that authorities had never found Tapp\u2019s DNA at the crime scene. Tapp was convicted and had at that point served nearly 20 years because of his own words, a confession he made to police. I was immediately struck by the fact that Michael Usry Jr. and Chris Tapp had found themselves in similar situations, 20 years apart. Both men said they knew nothing about the murder of Angie Dodge , both men had their DNA tested and both men did not match that of the killer, yet one man went to prison and the other man went home. That was the story I pitched to \"48 Hours\" executive producer Susan Zirinsky.", "Chris Tapp, serving time for the murder of Idaho teen Angie Dodge, shows CBS News correspondent Anne-Marie Green what his life is like inside the...", "The day both Michael Usry and I went to see Chris Tapp in prison, I was struck by how soft spoken and kind Tapp was. He cried twice that day, once when I asked about the moment in his interrogation when he began to implicate himself in Angie\u2019s murder, and a second time when Michael Usry showed him a video of something that was shot for a documentary Usry is making about this case. It was an interview with Tapp\u2019s wife, Lori, who Tapp had met and married while in prison. In the video, Lori spoke of how much she admired her husband and believed in his innocence. The interview was conducted shortly before Lori was killed in a car crash, and this was the first time Tapp had heard her voice since the accident. I think there are many lessons in this case, but writing strictly as it relates to the privacy of DNA databases, the lesson is this: When you trade your DNA for information you are also giving it away -- and the database you give it to, owns it. What if that company goes out of business and sells the database? Do the protections you have been promised still stand? What if an insurance company wants to know if you carry a specific gene that could increase your chances of getting cancer, or indicates a penchant for risk taking?  ", "Right now, the judicial system is playing catch up when it comes to your rights and protections, so we should all be aware and read the fine print. There is nothing wrong with wanting to know where you came from and what your genes can tell you about your health; just make sure you know what you are signing up for.

Bizarro looks and acts like Superman but lives by the exact reverse logic: he says adjectives to mean their opposite, he sees it as a crime to do good, and so on. There\u2019s a great Seinfeld episode based on the character.", "In today\u2019s age of superhero movie ubiquity, it\u2019s tempting to read 2000\u2019s Unbreakable as a Bizarro version of everything that proceeded it. The basic similarities are all there: a cloaked protagonist with superhuman strength locks horns with a scheming, criminally insane supervillain. We see the reluctant hero, played here by Bruce Willis, come to terms with his powers, use them for civic protection and watch him win the girl before finally overcoming his nemesis. We get both characters\u2019 origin stories in flashback, and both are played by Hollywood A-listers. It\u2019s the preeminent blockbuster blueprint.", "And yet it by no means and exaggeration to say that Unbreakable is the exact antithesis of Marvel and DC\u2019s current output. For starters, it clocks in at 106 minutes and its cast barely extends beyond the four central actors. Nothing explodes, erupts or is shot at from beginning to end. There is no shouting. The film is shot and cut with a near-maddening degree of patience, its soundtrack almost noiseless for long spells, and it resorts to eye-catching CGI not once.", "It may be anathema to the box-office behemoths of today, but there\u2019s no doubt that M Night Shyamalan\u2019s film is a superhero movie in the truest sense. Nor that, as its camera glides affectionately down the aisles of comic-book stores drinking in vintage illustrations, it shows a genuine passion for the original form that is unmatched by anything that has come since (with the possible exception of Sam Raimi\u2019s Spiderman films).", "The present glut of cinematic universe-forging comic-book adaptations has born some decent films and some terrible ones, but none can claim to rival the atmosphere and immersion of Unbreakable. Remember the face-clawing tedium that was the final hour of Man of Steel ? Indestructible hero and indestructible villain throwing each other through brick walls ad nauseum, CGI skyscrapers reduced to CGI rubble at a rate of knots, the level of peril remaining at precisely zero throughout. Unbreakable\u2019s final encounter includes not a single building flattened, not a single punch thrown and lasts all of five minutes. Instead, we see Willis\u2019 David Dunn defeat his arch-nemesis by dobbing him in to the authorities. It is a scene of understated gravitas, perhaps the most affecting showdown of any modern superhero movie.", "It\u2019s also significant that the other character at the heart of Unbreakable is Samuel L Jackson\u2019s villain. Six years before he was being driven to high-pitched distraction by those muthafuckin\u2019 snakes on that muthafuckin\u2019 plane, Hollywood\u2019s keenest scenery-stealer took to the screen with uncharacteristic restraint as embittered comic-art dealer Elijah Price, barely raising his voice above a murmur throughout (and his one concession to theatricality, the berating of a customer intending on buying a limited edition print for his kid, works as a nice metaphor for how the film wants to treats its audience like adults).", "If Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker was so arresting because of his lack of motive, Jackson\u2019s cane-clutching baddie chills precisely because his are so plainly stated. But while Ledger used a manic physicality to unnerve, Jackson achieves the same end through the opposite means: his resolutely undemonstrative \"Mr Glass\" is straight from the John Doe school of dead-calm supervillainy. The scene where he repeatedly sabotages a book store clerk\u2019s attempts to wheel him out of the shop is a more effective, more affecting demonstration of directionless rage than any of the extravagant acts of terrorism enacted by his screen successors.", "While today\u2019s superhero movies aim for excitement via loud action and bloated narratives, Unbreakable is deadly quiet, only lightly dusted with plot and told with an everyday realism that verges on mundanity. Its sole fight sequence is unpleasant and ungainly, actively un-thrilling, shot from a distance in one unbroken take. Admittedly the film\u2019s slow pacing can seem a bit strained at times, but it\u2019s a directorial style that takes guts to pull off this effectively \u2013 and one that\u2019s aged well over a 16-year period in which frenzied spectacle has become the new normal.", "Two years after Unbreakable was released, Raimi\u2019s first Spider-Man film became the highest grossing film of that year, taking close to half a billion dollars worldwide and effectively igniting the superhero movie boom. A decade on, Marvel\u2019s list of past and prospective releases stands at 45, while DC having latterly leapt aboard the gravy train. Between them, these studios are working hard to ensure that the summer blockbuster season remains choc-a-bloc with superhero movies, a trend which shows no sign of letting up. \"These are mediocre times, Mrs Dunn,\" Jackson tells Robin Wright\u2019s Audrey Dunn in Unbreakable. \"People are starting to lose hope.\" He didn\u2019t know the half of it.", "Published 21 Aug 2016"], "targetTitle": "Why Unbreakable remains the ultimate superhero movie - Little White L...", "targetDescription": null, "targetKeywords": null, "targetMedia": ["https://archive.is/m6cIr/826632c8c919a363a5d565b5ac80d3fb20d5c23b.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/f7e02120b1a9a7be3480b8e3c64c372de911cec4.jpg", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/db12219cd0c0fa474288f8d970a53ab365ec3d8e.jpg", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/2ca12a003ba2a59eaa73e6535cbb94bf543e6a93.gif", "data:image/png;base64,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", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/1ec83eec7c5c0bc2a0a9302951ea04935a821221.gif", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/758e32443ba20b573effd1955aacd2eff5548d2a.png", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/7681e135e809ac8f9551e469a1f6b3cb272dc54b.jpg", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/04e4c94b5c8a4b878a05254ed1ce5d88bdd7bfac.jpg", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/81230d834f783fb41b691f536f8924d8ca008874.png", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/5991382db5636f1b796bbb5a6fdbd52608fc639f.jpg", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/1ab21373f5e4192ba5007f2d5a5973e736609950.jpg", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/1dd54d468af6c34af10c347ac5830188c19d19ec.jpg", "data:image/png;base64,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", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/0f774ba70f36292ec6e9d838a1debb8a7699f73c.gif", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/4aa495994deb51c4acb914601e8fa25ed6b05fe4.jpg", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/18057c7ff90d9e0c22110ee1510d6391750c67a6.gif", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex/6gNJowqlzHFZ/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/12d1f3ed0019ab17c3d47008876f3ac889ee8948.jpg", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/cfe2c135c2c54c1eaf04619f798e3b10e5728a5d/scr.png", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/d0b67952f24359504ee12553d50a9d99cee43f6c.png", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/1744ae0412c17bb5266cc672ebd91b1548744372.jpg", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/0cf5bafd1bb3b51a77e40b35e789fb460e6a4980.jpg"], "targetUrl": "https://archive.is/m6cIr", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "It's not Marvel or DC", "spoilerPublisher": "savedyouaclick"}, "spoiler": ["none can claim to rival the atmosphere and immersion of Unbreakable"], "spoilerPositions": [[[4, 125], [4, 192]]], "tags": ["passage"], "predicted_labels": 0}

You buy a bond. Then you get back interest payment. So easy, even your great uncle Mort can do it.", "Jordan Weissmann Jordan Weissmann is Slate\u2019s senior business and economics correspondent.", "These days, things aren't so straightforward: The sovereign-debt markets have devolved into a bizarro world of upside-down expectations. Yields on government bonds from all around the world have been plunging thanks to anxious investors buying them for their safety. (Bond yields fall as prices rise.) And in many instances, the returns have cratered below zero. As Quartz reports Thursday, \"around a third of all developed-country government debt\u2014or more than $7 trillion, in terms of market value\u2014is now trading at negative yields,\" meaning that buyers are willing to pay more for these bonds than they will eventually get back if they hold them to maturity. This is remarkable. Countries like Germany have been selling short- and midterm debt at negative yields for a while, but now it\u2019s happening with bonds dated for 10 years or longer. Investors are basically banging down the door for the guarantee that they will only lose a little bit of money over the next decade or two.", "The most mind-blowing example of this trend is Switzerland. Last week, yields on all of its government bonds, out to 50 years, turned negative. Investors are now expected to pay for the privilege of lending money to the Swiss for a half-century at a time. Other countries are getting nearly as good deals. Fifteen-year German and Japanese bond yields have also drifted below zero. Even economically wounded Spain can borrow for a few years at a time and theoretically make a profit. It's like a bad financial-world play on a Yakov Smirnoff joke: In Switzerland, lender pay you!", "Why are investors settling for these kinds of terms? For one, they don't see many other safe options. The world economy still feels shaky, especially after the Brexit vote, which sent bond yields even lower. Meanwhile, stashing cash in a vault somewhere costs money and effort\u2014you need to cover the cost of security and storage. So they're willing to pay governments to essentially hold their euros or yen or Swiss francs. The fact that long-dated bonds are going negative also means that the markets don't expect inflation to rise much down the line, which means they don't expect world growth to pick up much either. It may even be a sign that some investors see deflation on the horizon, since a bond with a negative yield could theoretically be profitable if prices fall enough in a country.", "All of which is to say: Today's sub-zero bond yields are a sign of how deeply pessimistic investors have become about both the near and somewhat distant future. And if they stay down, they could create some nasty problems of their own. When long-term interest rates fall too low, for instance, it makes it very hard for banks to earn a profit by borrowing and lending. This is playing out all over, but right now, people are looking very nervously at Italy's banks in particular, which are parched for profits while sitting on a pile of bad loans. As Matt O'Brien notes at the Washington Post, low bond yields around the world can make it hard for central banks to ever raise rates, since the second they do, investors will rush to buy that government's bonds. Among other things, that can push up the value of a currency, hurting exports and risking deflation."], "targetTitle": "Something Crazy Is Happening to Swiss Bonds, and It\u2019s a Sad Sign for the World Economy", "targetDescription": "Investing in government debt used to be a boring, pretty straightforward proposition.

The new Visa cards provide members with 4% cash back on up to $7,000 of gas purchases annually, plus 3% back on restaurant and eligible travel purchases, 2% back for Costco purchases, and 1% back on everything else. The old Costco AmEx card, by comparison, gave 3% cash back on gas purchases up to $4,000 annually.", "In the case of both of the new and old Costco-affiliated credit cards, the cash back can be redeemed only at Costco.

The cash back applies to purchases up to $1,500 per quarter, and while the cash back offer was originally only supposed to apply to the second quarter of 2016, it\u2019s been extended to the entire year", "So, looking ahead, Chase Freedom cardholders have the possibility of earning 5% cash back on up to $1,500 worth of Costco purchases (for a total of $75 back) during the third quarter (July 1 to September 30), and again during the fourth quarter (October 1 to December 31).

As living things, humans are still evolving. Since we became Homo sapiens, has evolution changed us in any way? Actually, yes.", "Thousands of genes have evolved recently (in the last 40,000 years). Changes we are seeing include smaller brains (more efficient, not dumber), resistance to diseases, increases in ADHD and blue eyes. Yes, blue eyes. Genetic analysis says the first blue-eyed human appeared 6,000-10,000 years ago somewhere in the Black Sea region. For whatever reason, the phenotype became very popular (conferring a 5% greater chance for reproduction) and today about half a billion blue-eyed folk exist.", "Another famous example is HgbS (sickling hemoglobin), a gene that makes humans immune to malaria. Malaria is the number one killer of humans, so it makes sense that a mutation eventually arose that makes human red blood cells resistant to the malaria parasites, and for the gene to rise in frequency in malaria-prone populations (sub-Saharan Africa). Unfortunately, the same gene also causes sickle cell anemia. We all have two copies of every gene in our body (one from mom, one from dad), and if one copy is the malaria-resistant mutant HgbS, you're fine, but if both are the mutant, you get sickle cell disease. The good news is that many other genes confer resistance to malaria, and we are also seeing leprosy and tuberculosis resistance genes appearing, too.", "Another example is the gene for lactose tolerance. Primitive man would drink milk as a baby, and then never again, so the amount of lactase enzyme (which breaks down a common sugar in milk) would fall after a few years of age. Over time, however, humans have evolved so that certain populations will keep producing the enzyme into late adulthood. As expected, the lactose-tolerant trait appears most often in the regions where dairy farming arose first and became an important part of the diet (Caucasians). Tolerance for milk is supposed to have evolved only 3,000-8,000 years ago, and is now found in nearly 95% of North Europeans.", "Our mouths are changing, too. They are getting smaller and more bullet-shaped. Our teeth aren't quite changing as fast, which is why orthodontics and wisdom teeth removal still exist ... for now. More and more people are being born without wisdom teeth, or have their wisdom teeth erupt later if at all. Wisdom teeth were useful before knives and cooking, when humans would probably lose molars to chewing hard food and needed the wisdom teeth as replacements. Today, 35% of people lack wisdom teeth, although the genes involved in this are unknown so we aren't quite sure why this is happening yet.", "Darwin's theory of natural selection evolves.", "So what will we look like 100,000 years from now, assuming we still exist that far in the future?

What Science Is Saying About Fiction Readers"], "postPlatform": "reddit", "targetParagraphs": ["Will S.", "For most, the love of books starts in childhood. For others, this love blooms later, eventually revealing the vibrant colors of a true bibliophile! But science has started looking into the effects of reading on the brain. They\u2019ve done experiments, ran MRIs, polled, and surveyed, all to what end? Studies have been released in the past several years that have given scientists some interesting data about fiction readers and what type of fiction they should read!", "What has science concluded? Studies are showing that readers of fiction are more empathetic towards others. By engaging with a story, readers are temporarily placing themselves in a character\u2019s shoes, therefore, the more stories you read, the more shoes you\u2019ve tried on. It\u2019s a fascinating insight into the world of reading.", "In 2012, Standford University did research into why this is. According to neuroscientist Bob Dougherty,", "\"The right patterns of ink on a page can create vivid mental imagery and instill powerful emotions.\"", "Your brain does amazing things while you\u2019re reading, the breadth of which researchers are still defining. And by placing yourself into the world of a great novel, you are given the chance to experience something new that could be informative in your interactions with other people.", "This compassion was notably detected in children reading Harry Potter. Another experiment \"conducted three studies to test whether extended contact through reading the popular best-selling books of Harry Potter improves attitudes toward stigmatized groups (immigrants, homosexuals, refugees).\"", "The conclusion of the study was that children who identified with Harry as a character reacted to his sympathy for marginalized groups (such as \"mudbloods\") by becoming more sympathetic towards similar groups in contemporary society (such as the LGBT and immigrant communities). But this was only shown after these connections were explicated to the children and only if they identified with Harry.", "What does this all mean?", "Sure, we create images in our heads of the stories we read \u2013we engage with language, we sympathize with the characters in our books\u2013 but besides Harry Potter, which books should we be reading to maximize these cognitive benefits?", "The authors of another study, David Comer Kidd and Emanuele Castano, tackled this question, but also asserted that what you choose read is important! As Castano explained to Mic.com:", "\"We believe that one critical difference between lit and pop fiction is the extent to which the characters are complex, ambiguous, difficult to get to know, etc. (in other words, human) versus stereotyped, simple...\"", "Through their research, they found that readers of literary fiction receive more of the empathetic benefits of reading than those who read pop-fiction or non-fiction. The term \"literary fiction\" seems arbitrary, but Kidd and Castano explain that literary fiction merely denotes the level of complexity in stories and their characters (at least, that\u2019s what it means in the context of their study).", "In 50 Shades Of Grey, for example, the characters are laid out. They react to each other and to their environment. By no means are these characters simple or easy, but they do not evoke the same complicated and uncanny feelings that one experiences with Nick Carraway as he narrates The Great Gatsby.", "Reading in general helps with empathy, but literary reading amplifies this effect. By reading a challenging book, you\u2019re not only becoming a smarter person, you\u2019re also become more empathetic. Literature is not always easy, but by attempting to tackle harder books, we create new connections in our minds that we might not have otherwise.", "Like opening a window to let fresh air into your home, literature opens up our minds to the myriad ideas that we wouldn\u2019t be able to experience on our own!

The tweet, which I\u2019ll paraphrase, said that people who listen to rappers like Kodak Black, Migos, Young Thug, Future, Fetty Wap, and Lil Yachty are people who subsequently have low IQs. This isn\u2019t exactly an unfamiliar comment that can be found online. I\u2019ve seen tweets before that have told me that I\u2019m stupid for listening to more Fetty Wap songs than Tupac songs in the past year. I\u2019m not a real hip hop fan, apparently. There are a couple points I want to get to about these sorts of popular, conformist opinions.", "First of all, the digital era and internet presence of hip hop has made the genre as inclusive a community as I\u2019ve ever seen it. Chance the Rapper made Free (Based Freestyles Mixtape) with Lil B. Mac Miller has a song with Chief Keef on his last album, GO:OD AM. Andre 3000 dropped a lengthy verse on \"Sixteen,\" a song off of Rick Ross\u2019 God Forgives, I Don\u2019t. What haven\u2019t 2 Chainz and Thugger not been featured on this decade? Rappers with completely different styles and interpretations of hip hop are frequently working together these days. Your favorite, thoughtful, wordy rapper could put out a song with your least favorite, struggle-bar spitting rapper. It\u2019s only a matter of time before it happens (unless it already has).", "So if a rapper like Danny Brown wants to hop on the remix for SD\u2019s \"New World Order\" (as he did), does that mean that Danny Brown has a low IQ? Or even, does SD have a low IQ for rapping repetitive and simplistic lyrics in a sub-genre of rap (drill) that almost depends on recycling lyrics/themes? The answer to both questions is no. Therefore, it doesn\u2019t matter if someone\u2019s favorite rapper is Kodak Black or Kendrick Lamar\u2014it doesn\u2019t in any way reflect someone\u2019s intelligence.", "Now, I can\u2019t really speak on the actual IQ numbers of the people I know, but I can say with confidence that I know a lot of very intelligent people who like rappers who aren\u2019t considered lyrical rappers. My sister, who does have a gifted-level IQ, has become a big Future fan. One of my college roommates frequently listens to Migos, and he will be attending law school next fall. My girlfriend, who is an award-winning writer, and who could run laps around most people with her expert grasp of language, gets hype to Flocka like none other. My favorite hip hop project of the year (if I\u2019m not considering the force that is Death Grips\u2019 Bottomless Pit a rap album, which I\u2019m not) is Lil Yachty\u2019s Lil Boat mixtape, and I just graduated from my liberal arts college with departmental honors. And I think \"Minnesota (Remix),\" which ironically features Quavo of Migos and Young Thug, is one of the most fun hip hop songs I\u2019ve heard all year. People with any level of intelligence are free to like any kind of music they want to. What\u2019s wrong with putting Kodak Black\u2019s \"SKRT\" and Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \"The Art of Peer Pressure\" on the same playlist?", "In fact, there\u2019s nothing wrong with liking both Kodak Black and Kendrick Lamar. Speaking of Kendrick Lamar, I have a friend who told me once that Machine Gun Kelly was a better artist than Kendrick. Sure, I cringed and adamantly disagreed, but ultimately it didn\u2019t make a difference what I thought. It\u2019s never cool to make someone feel bad for what they like or love, even if the music they like might be unpopular, weird, or bad to you. It\u2019s twice as lame to post on social media how terrible certain rappers are (rappers who could care less about the opinions of fans who they aren\u2019t trying to attract anyway) and even worse to trash the innocent fans of these rappers.", "There will always be pretentiousness when it comes to any kind of art. I\u2019m guilty of it as much as I\u2019m sure a lot of people are. But opinions on hip hop are subjective. It\u2019s important to be open-minded. There are so many unique sub-genres of rap that are waiting to be explored that may not rely on lyrics, poetry, or message as much as maybe the sound, vocal delivery, or overall aesthetic. There\u2019s a reason Common isn\u2019t ever requested at the bar. I don\u2019t hear A Tribe Called Quest during warmups for big basketball games. How does one dance to an Immortal Technique song?", "Hip hop needs guys that make music with energy. Hip hop needs rappers who allow us to tune out their words and just feel their music. Hip hop fans don\u2019t need to feel pressured to only listen to music that is considered smart. Smart isn\u2019t everything, and just because a song is intellectually smart, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it is enjoyable to listen to. People have different tastes.

{"uuid": "cde3869b-ebd5-4562-9fc6-60e5918bae50", "postId": "4uai7m", "postText": ["What would happen if the Olympics banned Russia?"], "postPlatform": "reddit", "targetParagraphs": ["Imagine the most stereotypically Russian way an Olympic doping scandal could play out. Are you thinking sketchy FSB agents? Passing urine samples back and forth through a hole in a wall ... hidden behind a cabinet in a laboratory? And everything kinda sorta maybe ties back to Putin? Because then you\u2019d be absolutely right.", "This morning, the Court of Arbitration for Sport made a ruling on Russia\u2019s cartoonish state-sponsored skullduggery, which has been going on since 2010: It upheld the International Association of Athletic Federations\u2019 ban on Russian track and field athletes in the Rio Olympics, whether there\u2019s hard evidence they were juicing or not. The International Olympics Committee is still making up its mind about that ban, but it\u2019s also still possible it will ban the country altogether\u2014a decision that would affect not just the medal counts in Rio, but the state of international athletics.", "Marcus Noland, executive vice president and director of studies at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, builds models that forecast medal counts based on past performance, population, GDP, and other variables. In London, the Russians won four to 16 more medals than his models predicted\u2014meaning their wins were probably inflated by doping. And his numbers have been borne out: The Olympic committee has since reallocated 11 Russian medals from the London games.", "If the Russians competed in Rio cleanly (or, as Noland says, \"no dirtier than average\"), his models suggest they\u2019re good for 66 or 67 medals. So how many more would he expect if doping went on unchecked? If they managed to nab 11 extra medals in London, when their doping program was still relatively new, you can bet they could get at least that number and then some. Noland figures the Russians would have come away with about 80 medals.", "If the IOC does ban Russia, that\u2019s enough medals to throw any Olympic predictions seriously out of whack. And many of the medals that might have otherwise gone to Russian athletes would likely go to competitors from the US, as they did at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics that the Soviet Union boycotted: In the absence of the USSR, the US\u2019s total medal count skyrocketed to 174, and fell to 94 when the Soviets returned to the Olympics in 1988. \"For the Olympic movement, it\u2019s a huge deal,\" says David Wallechinsky, the President of the International Society of Olympic Historians. \"This isn\u2019t Tonga or Paraguay, it\u2019s one of three big medal winners.\"", "For the average American Olympics viewer, the absence of Russian athletes might go unnoticed. Where it most certainly will be noticed, of course, is Russia. \"You cannot separate the Olympics from politics,\" says Wallechinsky. \"That\u2019s a myth. Russia is already saying this a Western plot.\" Countries have been banned from the Olympics before, but it\u2019s always been for overtly political reasons. Germany and Japan were not on the Olympic guest list for the 1948 Summer Olympics, South Africa was banned during the apartheid era, and Afghanistan was banned in 2000.", "The potential Russian ban wouldn\u2019t be that much of a departure from those decisions, because Olympic athletes\u2019 doping is inherently political. \"If doping is done for the glory of the nation state, even if the athlete is doing it in secret with just an Internet connection and a PO box, it can take on an element of politics,\" says John Gleaves, co-director of the International Network of Humanistic Doping Research. And state-sponsored doping is the same, but, you know, more so.", "One of the reasons that doping has remained such a problem at the Olympics is that the whole process is completely byzantine, and countries are left to police themselves. \"The anti-doping setup had led to a really lumpy enforcement,\" says Gleaves. \"How much anti-doping work can Kenya be expected to do when you look at its ranking in GDP?\" The Russian doping scandal puts a spotlight on a problem that was already systemic in international sports.", "Which may very well drive the IOC to be a stickler for the sake of its integrity and credibility. \"The IOC is trying to hitch its wagon to environmental sustainability, wider participation in sport, sensible urban planning, and clean sport\u2014and failed on all those accounts,\" says The Games: A Global History of the Olympics . He puts on his best John Goodman: \"\u2018I\u2019m talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.'\" Which may very well drive the IOC to be a stickler for the sake of its integrity and credibility. \"The IOC is trying to hitch its wagon to environmental sustainability, wider participation in sport, sensible urban planning, and clean sport\u2014and failed on all those accounts,\" says David Goldblatt , author ofThe Games: A Global History of the Olympics. He puts on his best John Goodman: \"\u2018I\u2019m talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.'\"", "And this scandal seems an appropriate place for the IOC to draw that line. Look at what happened to East German athletes in the 1970s. \"At the nadir, doping accounted for 17 percent of the medals won in women\u2019s competitions,\" says Noland. \"There was no informed consent. You now have high rates of birth defects amongst East German athletes. The stuff they gave them had incredible, multi-generational physiological damage. I regard this as really evil.\" Whether you think that doping is inherently bad or the future of athletic excellence, state-sponsored doping is not in the spirit of the games."], "targetTitle": "What Would Happen if the Olympics Banned Russia?", "targetDescription": "Because the Olympics are always political, and state-sponsored doping sure is too.", "targetKeywords": null, "targetMedia": ["http://archive.is/kvX42/a0d35dcc1f144f724e533c02322ad2f1f84ed0db.jpg", "http://archive.is/kvX42/8e2fba476fa12929c8e57044fd4224862cc659b8.jpg", "http://archive.is/kvX42/6cb066f3cc322055fbc027674f9093504fe0841d.jpg", "http://archive.is/kvX42/d80edde401b0404a95987e46c6ae800d6ddd686f.png", "http://archive.is/kvX42/4450fbb86cdb5cc9b9cf12bb16399f3ae95ec19b.png", "http://archive.is/kvX42/ce85099bf875533ca2a7a57869e643f88314dc50.jpg", "http://archive.is/kvX42/0dabde7bde542821d340f80f75981c23f4a385b2.jpg", "http://archive.is/kvX42/c4f66ffcaa2014b1c730fbf1b1bdd0c921ee39d9.jpg", "http://archive.is/kvX42/a28dd3ac060157e2d7d11d047e8bee875d073742/scr.png", "http://archive.is/kvX42/dae257cd8abc7aa725392bbe6006c78f3601aea6.jpg", "data:image/png;base64,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", "http://archive.is/kvX42/4f745675ee7f667b2fcc685e94b288330a1d21eb.jpg", "http://archive.is/kvX42/c8728df74487f907230358a1b08ae1a1b25f9ed4.png", "http://archive.is/kvX42/79a5c6689b557efb5f61308f3a145434bec6dea3.jpg", "http://archive.is/kvX42/ebd66de2ae8b9ab064e7f62c12c4b4198ae86313.png", "data:image/png;base64,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", "http://archive.is/kvX42/54600d504feaafcf6a9810f8f602532429a2c023.jpg", "http://archive.is/kvX42/f12f9f28bfaeb4b412e823400d68f1c99664ccdd.jpg", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex/6gNJowqlzHFZ/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==", "http://archive.is/kvX42/113c05fcfb6492c0d9262e1042490ed0a494eec1.jpg"], "targetUrl": "http://archive.is/kvX42", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "The U.S. athletes would win more medals.", "spoilerPublisher": "savedyouaclick"}, "spoiler": ["enough medals to throw any Olympic predictions seriously out of whack.

Add the ice water a tablespoon at a time and begin to gather the dough together with your hands. Pat the dough into a 1-inch-thick square and wrap in plastic to chill for a couple of hours in the fridge (or at least 30 minutes).", "2. Roast the squash: While the crust is chilling, preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Using a sharp knife, halve the squash and hollow out the seedy center with a spoon. Place squash cut sides up on a baking sheet and brush with butter. Bake for about one hour, or until the flesh is soft and cooked through. Once it's cooled, scoop out the flesh and add to a food processor with the pumpkin pure\u0301e and mix until smooth. (If the squash is very wet, place in a cheesecloth and press to get rid of any excess moisture.) Set aside.", "3. Make the cardamom cream: I\u200bn a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring cream and cardamom to a gentle simmer. Turn off heat, cover, and steep for 20 minutes. Strain and set aside to cool.", "4. Mix the filling: I\u200bn a medium bowl, w\u200bhisk together light brown sugar, spices, cornmeal, and salt. In another bowl, mix eggs with cardamom cream, squash, and vanilla and whisk until smooth. Slowly pour egg mixture into sugar mixture and whisk until combined.", "5. Prepare the pie crust: Flour your work surface and place the unwrapped dough in the center. Roll out, keeping it moving with your hands and throwing on more flour as needed to prevent sticking, until you have a disk of even thickness that\u2019s about 12 inches in diameter. Invert your pie tin or dish onto the circle, and cut a circle that is about 1 to 2 \u00adinches larger than the tin. Place the folded dough into the pie tin and gently press it in. Roll up the extra dough hanging over the edge toward the center of the pie, creating a ring of dough, then crimp it all around. Put the crust in the freezer for at least 15 minutes.", "6. Blind bake the pie crust so that it holds its shape and is cooked through in the finished pie: P\u200breheat the oven to 425 degrees with a rack on the lowest level. Remove the pie crust from the freezer and place a square of aluminum foil over it. Fill with dried beans and place on baking sheet. Bake in oven for 15 minutes. Cool for 6 minutes, then carefully remove foil and beans. Turn heat down to 325 degrees.", "Travel with us, drive with us, eat with us. Get our weekly Pursuits newsletter.", "7. Fill and finish the pie: Brush the crimped edges of pie crust with a little bit of egg wash, then spoon all of the tahini\u00ad-walnut paste onto the bottom of the crust and spread evenly (you can use your fingers to gently press it down). Pour the squash filling over the paste and carefully transfer back to oven. Bake pie for 40 minutes to 1 hour, until the edges are puffed up and the center is only slightly jiggly, then remove from oven and sprinkle lightly with sesame seeds. The pie should rest for at least 2 hours before slicing, and can also chill for a couple of hours in the fridge after it\u2019s cooled if you like to serve it cold.", "Tejal Rao is the New York food critic for Bloomberg.

But is Linux getting to the point where it can take on Windows in PC gaming?", "A writer at TechRadar remains quite skeptical about the possibility of Linux someday becoming the top gaming operating system for PCs.", "Game Carey reports for TechRadar:", "Evidently, Windows isn\u2019t going anywhere, with a Steam market share of nearly 96% as of March 2016. In fact, Epic Games even recently called Microsoft out on trying to \"monopolize\" PC gaming with its Universal Windows Platform initiatives. Although Microsoft has lost sight of what PC gamers want in recent years (see: Games for Windows Live), there\u2019s no doubt that the current Xbox head Phil Spencer wants to bring the company back to its roots, namely by integrating features (and games) from the Xbox One into Windows 10. In contrast, Valve\u2019s attempts at making Linux not only the best place to play games from your Steam library, but actually the heart of your living room are tough to jive with. Despite making an effort with SteamOS, it doesn\u2019t help that a number of companies still haven\u2019t released their November 2015-bound Steam Machines after neglecting to comply with the operating system\u2019s handicaps. There\u2019s a clear winner here, and unless Linux rectifies its performance disparity, lack of natively supported control options and impoverished game library, the OS to beat for PC gaming will remain Windows 10. More at TechRadar", "DistroWatch reviews FreeBSD 10.3\u2019s new features", "Jesse Smith at DistroWatch did a full review of FreeBSD 10.0 a while back, and now he has some thoughts to share about the new features that have been added to the recently released FreeBSD 10.3.", "Jesse Smith reports for DistroWatch:", "FreeBSD is a venerable operating system, often deployed on servers due to the project\u2019s focus on performance and stability. At the beginning of April the FreeBSD project released version 10.3 of their operating system. The release announcement for FreeBSD 10.3 mentioned several features and improvements which caught my attention. Specifically the availability of ZFS boot environments, 64-bit Linux compatibility and jail improvements were of interest to me. I was especially eager to try out FreeBSD\u2019s new jails technology using the iocage front-end. The iocage software has been presented as an improvement on (and replacement for) Warden, a friendly front-end for handling jail environments. One of the first things I wanted to do was experiment with boot environments. For those who have not used them before, a boot environment is basically a snapshot of our operating system. Before performing any major configuration change or software upgrade we can take a snapshot of the operating system. This gives us a point in time when we knew the operating system was working. We then perform any changes or upgrades we want. When we boot the system we can choose, from the boot menu, which snapshot we want to use. This allows us to effectively move backward in time and boot older copies of the system. This makes the operating system virtually bullet proof as almost any change (short of hardware failure) can be fixed by simply rebooting and selecting to boot an older copy of the operating system. The PC-BSD and openSUSE projects have used boot environments successfully for some time now, but the technology has not widely caught on elsewhere. The next item on my list of things to try was 64-bit Linux compatibility. FreeBSD has a compatibility layer which allows the operating system to run Linux executables. There are some restrictions though. For example, up until now the Linux executable had to be compiled for 32-bit systems and any dependencies had to be copied into place manually. There is a package in the FreeBSD repository which installs the CentOS core userland software. In essence, this gives us a bare bones installation of CentOS 6 in a directory on our FreeBSD computer. This is handy if we need to run Linux software alongside FreeBSD software or if we want to run Linux software without the resource overhead of a full featured virtual machine. The final feature I wanted to look at was FreeBSD jails, specifically the way the iocage software works and how it compares to the older Warden jail management software. Jails on FreeBSD are basically very lightweight virtual machines. Part of the file system is roped off and processes can run in this area (jail) without knowing about or being able to affect the rest of the system. What primarily separates jails from virtual machines is jails all share the host\u2019s kernel, meaning jailed processes must be able to run on our version of FreeBSD. In recent years Docker has provided similar functionality on Linux. More at DistroWatch", "Linus Torvalds releases Linux kernel 4.6", "Linus has been very busy working on the next release of the Linux kernel, and now Linux 4.6 has been released into the wild.", "Simon Sharwood reports on what's new in Linux kernel 4.6 for The Register:", "New this time around is support for a bunch more ARM systems-on-a-chip, including Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 820. IBM\u2019s POWER9 finds its first support, although perhaps prematurely given the silicon won\u2019t arrive until late 2016. Whatever CPU you use to run Linux, it can now have a more complex conversation about when to vary its frequency, OrangeFS, XFS, Btrfs and EXT 4 users can all look for tweaks that enhance performance of their preferred file systems, while F2FS is now said to be rather better at running on flash storage. Dell\u2019s laptops will play nicer with Linux thanks to driver changes that permit hotkeys to be pressed into service. Raspberry Pi users may appreciate new drivers that are said to do lovely things for 3D graphics performance. More at The Register", "Did you miss a roundup?

But is the extra pinch to the pocket actually worth it?", "Last week, a Department of Agriculture report revealed just how much it really costs to shop organic.", "Organic eggs, milk and salad greens can cost upwards of 60 percent more than conventional alternatives, while items like apples, carrots, granola and spinach carry premiums of between 7 and 30 percent, the study said.", "Producing organic food tends to be costlier along every part of the supply chain -- including farming practices that usually require greater labor inputs and segregating organic ingredients from conventional ones.", "Though there may be logical reasons for the heftier price tag, does it really make sense as a consumer to pay more for organic food?", "The answer, it turns out, is anything but straightforward. Here, we explore this hotly contested issue.", "What the heck does organic mean anyway?", "Organic produce, according to the USDA, must be grown without synthetic pesticides, synthetic fertilizers or genetically modified organisms. Organic meat has to come from animals that were raised in a natural setting, didn't receive any antibiotics or hormones, and were fed 100 percent organic feed.", "\"By this general definition, [organic food] should be friendlier to the planet and pose less harm to human health,\" Chensheng Lu, an associate professor of environmental exposure biology at Harvard University, told The Huffington Post over email.", "When it comes to packaged foods, only a label that says \"100 percent organic\" indicates a product made solely with organic ingredients. \"Organic,\" on the other hand, means 95 percent of the ingredients are organic, while \"made with organic ingredients\" is reserved for products with at least 70 percent certified organic ingredients.", "There\u2019s skepticism among consumers, however, about the trustworthiness of organic labels. Last year, a study by market research firm Mintel found that a majority of American consumers think organic labeling is merely an \"excuse to charge more.\"", "Indeed, there\u2019s some evidence that organic labels may not always be reliable. A major issue, experts say, is a lack of a robust monitoring system to keep track of whether products that say they're organic really are.", "Still, despite a flawed system, there do appear to be measurable differences between foods labeled organic and those that are not.", "A 2012 meta-analysis published in the Annals of Internal Medicine comparing organic and conventional foods, for example, found that exposure to pesticide residue was more than five times higher in conventional produce. A 2014 study found that organic foods had significantly lower levels of toxic metals compared to conventional alternatives, and \"substantially higher\" levels of antioxidants.", "So, what does this mean for human health?", "According to the Environmental Working Group, nearly three-quarters of 7,000 produce samples tested by the USDA in 2014 contained pesticide residues. In some cases, these pesticides persisted on fruits and vegetables even when they were washed or peeled.", "Pesticide exposure has been linked to all kinds of health conditions, from neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's to cancer and birth defects.", "The jury, however, is still out as to whether or not the pesticides found in conventional foods are present in large enough quantities to actually make a difference to human health.", "In the 2012 meta-analysis, conventional fruits and vegetables were found to have far more pesticide residue than organic produce, but the levels were almost always under the maximum amount allowed by the Environmental Protection Agency.", "\"We\u2019re exposed to a cocktail of chemicals from our food on a daily basis,\" said Michael Crupain, the director of Consumer Reports\u2019 Food Safety and Sustainability Center, in an earlier post. \"It\u2019s not realistic to expect we wouldn\u2019t have any pesticides in our bodies in this day and age, but that would be the ideal. We just don\u2019t know enough about the health effects.\"", "Some organic food skeptics have also pointed out that non-synthetic pesticides are used on some organic farms as well -- and the science is still hazy as to whether or not those compounds have ill effects.", "When it comes to the nutritional value of organic food, there's also conflicting data.", "The 2012 meta-analysis did not find any significant nutritional differences between conventional and organic foods. A meta-analysis published two years later in the British Journal of Nutrition, however, found that organic produce may have substantially higher concentrations of antioxidants and other potentially beneficial compounds.", "A recent study, published in February, concluded that organic dairy and meat contain about 50 percent more omega-3 fatty acids.", "\"Omega-3s are linked to reductions in cardiovascular disease, improved neurological development and function, and better immune function,\" wrote study co-author Chris Seal, a professor of food and human nutrition at the U.K.\u2019s Newcastle University. \"But getting enough in our diet is difficult. Our study suggests that switching to organic would go some way towards improving intakes of these important nutrients.\"", "As for antibiotic use in food animals, the problems are more clear-cut.", "The Centers for Disease Control notes that \"[s]cientists around the world have provided strong evidence that antibiotic use in food-producing animals can have a negative impact on public health\" because the drugs allow antibiotic-resistant bacteria to develop. So choosing organic meat, or meat raised without antibiotics, is better than conventional when it comes to this issue.", "Other ways of measuring \"worth\":", "When considering the benefits of organic food, it can be tempting to focus on the impacts of such products on human health. But as Marion Nestle, author of Food Politics and professor of nutrition at New York University, noted, choosing organic has implications for the Earth\u2019s well-being, too.", "\"When done well, more work goes into producing organically, and organic methods are demonstrably better for soil and sustainability,\" she told HuffPost. \"Organics are about production values. Those values are important to me.\"", "According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, an agency dedicated to addressing world hunger, there are many environmental benefits of organic agriculture, including long-term sustainability, greater biodiversity and better soil health.", "But organic farming still isn't perfect. One meta-analysis found that though organic farming practices had fewer environmental impacts per acre, this was not necessarily true per product unit.", "Though the health impacts of conventional foods on consumers remain unclear, the detrimental effects of pesticides and other chemicals are more clearly documented in the case of farmworkers. There's also some evidence that people living in farm communities are at risk for chronic health problems as a result of chemical exposure. Pesticides used in strawberry farms in California, for instance, are associated with an increased cancer risk among children living in those areas, according to the Department of Pesticide Regulation.", "Lu said choosing organic can also have positive impacts on the food industry at large.", "\"Promoting organic agriculture will attract a new cohort of farmers who believes in producing healthier and safer foods,\" he said. \"It\u2019s [also] good for the economy, by eliminating the corporative monopoly.\"", "According to Food and Water Watch, economic power in the agriculture and food sector is unusually concentrated. The four largest companies, for instance, control 85 percent of soybean processing and 82 percent of the beef packing industry -- an oligopolistic situation that\u2019s economically harmful for both farmers and consumers.", "\"Communities with more medium- and smaller-sized farms have more shared prosperity, including higher incomes, lower unemployment and lower income inequality, than communities with larger farms tied to often-distant agribusinesses,\" the nonprofit writes.", "Many organic farms are small operations, though \"big organic\" farms do exist as well. If buying from a small farm is important to you, one option is to seek out a local farmers market, where you're often able to speak directly with a person who helped grow your produce.", "Organic on a budget", "Regularly purchasing organic products may simply not be financially feasible for many consumers, so Nestle suggests to just \"buy organic to the extent you can, when you can.\"", "And there are ways to do it on the cheap (or at least, more cheaply):", "1. Prioritize your purchases.", "\"It is most important for young children, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems to eat organic food,\" advised Deborah Gerszberg, a nutritionist at Columbia University\u2019s Pancreas Center, in a blog post.", "She also recommends buying organic animal products, including eggs and milk, as often as possible.", "\"Some companies aren\u2019t certified organic, but still pledge not to use hormones or unnecessary antibiotics. This would be a good second choice,\" she said.", "Choosing organic options for things that you or your household eat in large quantities is also a recommended practice. \"The repetitive intakes of pesticides from foods could cause more harm to your health than sporadic exposure,\" said Lu.", "For produce, buy organic if you're planning to eat the skin of the fruit or vegetable.", "\"Choose organic for the foods containing the highest amount of chemical residue, and choose conventional foods for foods with the least residue,\" said Gerszberg.", "The Environmental Working Group's \"Dirty Dozen\" and \"Clean Fifteen\" lists are helpful resources on this front. The first highlights conventional produce with the highest pesticide loads (such as strawberries, apples, nectarines, grapes and spinach). The \"clean\" list, on the other hand, catalogs produce least likely to hold pesticide residues. These include avocados, sweet corn, pineapples, cabbage and cauliflower.", "2. Buy in season (and local, if possible). Buying organic produce in season tends to be much kinder on the wallet. In addition visiting a farmers market, you could try purchasing a crop share or CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) to get local, in-season produce.", "Locally grown food is often fresher and tastier than the alternative.", "\"The crops are picked at their peak, and farmstead products like cheeses and are hand-crafted for best flavor,\" writes Vern Grubinger, a vegetable and berry specialist at the University of Vermont. \"Livestock products are processed in nearby facilities, and typically the farmer has direct relationship with processors, overseeing quality -- unlike animals processed in large industrial facilities.\"", "Buying local food is a community investment, Grubinger adds -- a way to not just support local businesses, but also to protect local ecosystems and help communities become more self-sufficient.

According to the Colorado Climate Center, there's no technical definition of \"days of sunshine,\" so measuring it gets tricky. They go on, however, to state that Colorado only has 30-40 overcast days per year, leaving at least 300 days of partial sunshine. They estimate only about 115 days that would fit the classic definition of clear... but 300 days of partial sunshine, at the least, still sounds awesome.", "2.

You also could potentially get drunk faster.", "3. Colorado is a beer-lover's happy place.", "Colorado consistently ranks among the best craft brew states in America. The state has more than 200 breweries, including 130 microbreweries, according to USA Today's 2013 count. Denver itself has more than 20 breweries.", "4. Because, the Rockies.", "Whether you're into skiing, hiking, climbing, driving or just looking at pretty scenery, the Rocky Mountains are easily one of America's greatest natural wonders.

Winding mountain roads are basically nature's roller coaster.", "Well, nature provided the mountain. Man built the road.

They are bull testicles and they are a delicacy...we kid you not.", "11. Coors Field is not just a place to watch baseball.", "The home of the Colorado Rockies is consistently ranked as one of the top ballparks in the country.

Well worry no longer, as the legendary filmmaker has told The Hollywood Reporter that he is not only \"super excited\" about the fifth installment but that adventure will still have a name at the end of the movie and that name will be Indiana Jones! \"I think this one is straight down the pike for the fans,\" said Spielberg, who would not reveal plot details, with one exception: \"The one thing I will tell you is I\u2019m not killing off Harrison [Ford] at the end of it.\" That\u2019s great news for fans who would likely balk at such an idea, the same way they would be furious if James Bond accidentally slipped in the shower and cracked his skull at the end of a (hypothetical) final 007 movie. Even if this turns out to be the last time Ford puts on the bullwhip and fedora, it doesn\u2019t mean the filmmakers have to have the death-defying character bite the dust. \"The opportunity to work with Steven again on this character which has brought pleasure to so many...

That gives us purpose and motivation to strive forward. Yet, it can have detrimental consequences to our mental health, activating stress indicators that come as a byproduct of pushing ourselves too hard towards massive goals.", "As psychologist Karl Weick suggests in his article \"Small Wins,\" we should make it an everyday practice to focus our attention towards the positive by counting each small win we make. By taking the Alcoholics Anonymous as an example, he suggests that the principle works due to the change in perspective. Instead of focusing on overwhelming and complex goals, participants are encouraged to choose small, achievable daily actions:", "The impossibility of lifetime abstinence is scaled down to the more workable task of not taking a drink for the next 24 hours, drastically reducing the size of a win necessary to maintain sobriety.", "By celebrating these small, daily wins, participants feel more confident and motivated to achieve the same satisfactory feeling the next day, and so the behavior gains momentum leading to an almost effortless achievement of the ultimate goal.", "The Dangers of Dreaming Big", "We are encouraged on a daily basis to \"dream big\" and set our bars high if we want to achieve great things. This phrase is an inescapable part of every motivational speech by almost every successful person who ever lived. There is nothing wrong in the saying itself, yet it tends to be misinterpreted by us, the regular mortals who are fascinated by fairy tale stories of dreams that come true to those who are brave enough to wish and focus on the ultimate goal.", "For every great achievement ever made, there have been a million of small wins and breakthroughs that gradually led there, and this is something many people tend to overlook when working on achieving their goals. If we forget to appreciate the small wins we regularly make, the following negative consequences will appear:", "Our sense of self-worth can be worsened", "We risk feeling bad about ourselves and feeling incompetent when we constantly compare present state to our final goals, which can only lessen our chances of making progress", "We are prone to the feeling of failure and depression when our goals can\u2019t be achieved", "The increased amount of stress we have to cope with when we work on getting it all and now is counterproductive, as it blocks our productivity and weakens our physical health", "Once we change the perspective from big to small and break our final goal into smaller, achievable chunks, we take the pressure off and avoid the risks to our health. By focusing on everyday progress, we automatically feel much more motivated, which causes our brain to get hooked on the positive rush and the feeling of accomplishment striving to achieve more. Understanding the importance of small wins and knowing how to apply it to your everyday life will cause tremendous benefits to your goal achieving and your overall health.", "Here is the 4-step process you can take to develop the habit of celebrating small wins:", "Step 1: Start small", "First of all, you need to write down your final goal, and forget about it. It sounds silly, but this will help you focus on the fragments ahead of you, which is the only way to get things done. Instead of wasting energy on planning months ahead, focus on the next day\u2019s challenges only. Be here and now and only think one step ahead in order to move forward. This will give you the constant sense of accomplishment, which will motivate you to move forward and boost your self-esteem.", "Step 2: Reflect often", "Every once in a while, take some time to reflect on your progress. So often we focus on goals yet to be accomplished and forget about the progress that has already taken place. This means comparing yourself \u2014 with yourself. For example, if your goal is to lose certain amount of weight, instead of beating yourself up for not getting there yet, you should compare some older photos of yourself to the new ones. By doing so, you will get the visual proof of your progress which serves as great inspiration for future advances and inspires positive emotions.", "Step 3: Reward yourself", "From early childhood, we get familiar with the achievement \u2014 reward formula which makes us consider it a norm in each such situation. Therefore, if you achieve certain success, no matter how big or small, your mind expects that you provide yourself with an adequate prize. If the reward doesn\u2019t come, your motivational fuel gets drained, making your efforts futile. So, next time when you catch yourself single-mindedly chasing a complex goal without appreciating the small wins, give yourself a break and treat yourself to a movie, favorite sweet, or a short trip with your friends.", "Step 4: Enjoy the process", "Maybe the most important element to keep in mind in order to maintain mental strength in a competitive and goal-oriented world is to remind yourself to be content with yourself and the goals achieved. Remember to have fun and not take yourself too seriously. Enjoy experimenting and growing. By appreciating the process and the lessons learned, you will be able to avoid the stress and negative emotions, even if you don\u2019t achieve the ultimate goal.", "ENDORSED BY Ricky Tang Editor", "Love this article?"], "targetTitle": "You Can Be Mentally Stronger If You Do This Small Act Every Day", "targetDescription": "Understanding the importance of small wins when you try to achieve your dreams will cause tremendous benefits to your overall mental health.", "targetKeywords": null, "targetMedia": ["http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2016/09/11000207/FotorCreated3-1024x576.jpg", "http://cdn-media-1.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2016/09/09040418/hands-night-festival-new-year-s-eve.jpg", "http://cdn-media-1.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2016/12/16060535/food-nature-autumn-nuts1-1024x682-170x170.jpg", "http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2016/12/15034951/Sleeping-Under-Blanket-with-Air-Conditioning11-170x170.jpg", "http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5d96ed0ccffa38e39d5aea68fb54922f?s=80&d=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lifehack.org%2Fwp-content%2Fthemes%2Flifehack-theme%2Fimages%2Fdefault-avatar%2FA.png&r=g", "http://cdn-media-1.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2016/12/18055239/Changs-Taekwondo-Breathing-170x170.jpg", "http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5d96ed0ccffa38e39d5aea68fb54922f?s=31&d=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lifehack.org%2Fwp-content%2Fthemes%2Flifehack-theme%2Fimages%2Fdefault-avatar%2FA.png&r=g", "http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2016/09/09040418/hands-night-festival-new-year-s-eve-1024x682.jpg", "http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7d20697b5cb6eaaa4fc4380694009a56?s=40&d=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lifehack.org%2Fwp-content%2Fthemes%2Flifehack-theme%2Fimages%2Fdefault-avatar%2FR.png&r=g"], "targetUrl": "http://www.lifehack.org/463850/you-can-be-mentally-stronger-if-you-do-this-small-act-every-day?ref=fbp&n=1", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "Focus on the positives of each small win - an \"each day at a time\" mentality. #StopClickBait", "spoilerPublisher": "Stop Clickbait - Lifestyle"}, "spoiler": ["counting each small win we make"], "spoilerPositions": [[[1, 151], [1, 182]]], "tags": ["passage"], "predicted_labels": 0}

When she emerged, she wrote about patients tied together with ropes, abusive staff and ubiquitous vermin, \"lunatics\" treated with nothing more restorative than ice baths, and, perhaps most disturbingly, patients who seemed to be perfectly sane, dumped there by a society that had few safety nets for women who were single, poor, and often immigrants.", "Serialized by Joseph Pulitzer's New York World, Nellie Bly's accounts (later collected in a book called Ten Days in a Mad-House) caused a sensation, fueled in no small part by her pluck\u2014she'd begun her career by writing a scathing rebuttal to an editorial titled \"What Girls Are Good For\"\u2014though her inge\u0301nue looks couldn't have hurt, either. But despite prose that shades purple to today's ears, Bly's work holds up not only for its daring, but for its impact: It prompted a grand jury investigation that led to changes she'd proposed, including a $26 million (in today's dollars) increase to the budget of the city's Department of Public Charities and Correction and regulations to ensure that only the seriously mentally ill were committed.", "Access to prisons has been vastly curtailed. There is no way to know what truly happens inside but to go there.", "Bly\u2014who'd go on to get herself arrested so she could investigate conditions at a women's prison, and to best Jules Verne's fictional protagonist by circumnavigating the world in 72 days\u2014was not the first journalist to go inside an institution to expose its inner workings. Or the last. Ted Conover also reported from behind prison walls, as did Ben Bagdikian, for whom MoJo's fellowship program is named. In 1961, John Howard Griffin ingested a chemical that darkened his skin to investigate racial apartheid in the United States. Barbara Ehrenreich took jobs at chain restaurants and Walmart to spotlight the plight of low-wage workers. Mac McClelland worked as a picker in a warehouse of an online shipping behemoth to report for Mother Jones.", "But while such investigations were commonplace in the muckraker era, they've grown increasingly rare. Why? First, there's a real concern over ethics. When is it okay for reporters to not announce themselves as such? There's no governing body of journalism, but a checklist written by Poynter ethicist Bob Steele provides guidelines for assessing when this kind of reporting is acceptable. I'll paraphrase:", "When the information obtained is of vital public interest.", "When other efforts to gain that information have been exhausted.", "When the journalist is willing to disclose the reason and nature of any deception.", "When the news organization applies the skill, time, and funding needed to fully pursue the story.", "When the harm prevented outweighs any harm caused.", "After meaningful deliberation of the ethical and legal issues.", "To see what private prisons are really like, Shane Bauer applied for a job with the Corrections Corporation of America. He used his own name and Social Security number, and he noted his employment with the Foundation for National Progress, the publisher of Mother Jones. He did not lie. He spent four months as a guard at a CCA-run Louisiana prison, and then we spent 14 more months reporting and fact-checking.", "We took these extraordinary steps because press access to prisons and jails has been vastly curtailed in recent decades, even as inmates have seen their ability to sue prisons\u2014often the only way potential abuses would pop up on the radar of news organizations or advocates\u2014dramatically reduced. There is no other way to know what truly happens inside but to go there.", "But here's the other reason investigations like this one have grown so rare: litigation. When ABC News busted Food Lion for repackaging spoiled meat for sale back in 1992, a jury bought the company's line that the real offense had been the falsification of employment applications and the reporters' failure to fulfill their assigned duties\u2014i.e., repackaging spoiled meat! The $5.5 million damage award was eventually knocked down to just two dollars, but it put a chill on this kind of muckraking for a generation, and during that time, corporate and official entities built an ever-tighter web of legal protections. Nondisclosure agreements\u2014once mainly the provenance of people who work on Apple product launches and Beyonce\u0301 videos\u2014are now seeping into jobs of all stripes, where they commingle with various other \"non-disparagement\" clauses and \"employer protection statutes.\" Somewhere along the way, employers' legitimate interest in protecting hard-won trade secrets has turned into an all-purpose tool for shutting down public scrutiny\u2014even when the organizations involved are more powerful than agencies of government.", "Companies' interest in protecting trade secrets has turned into a tool for shutting down public scrutiny.", "Or when, for that matter, they replace the government. When CCA (which runs 61 prisons, jails, and detention centers on behalf of US taxpayers) learned about our investigation, it sent us a four-page letter warning that Shane had \"knowingly and deliberately breached his duty to CCA by violating its policies,\" and that there could be all manner of legal consequences. The letter came not from CCA's in-house counsel, but from the same law firm that had represented a billionaire megadonor in his three-year quest to punish us for reporting on his anti-LGBT activities.

{"uuid": "b0d2ad72-89c7-415b-9cb4-75b966c35e74", "postId": "4l2uha", "postText": ["A Shocking Find In a Neanderthal Cave in France"], "postPlatform": "reddit", "targetParagraphs": ["In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France\u2019s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski\u2019s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up). Some 336 meters into the cave, the caver stumbled across something extraordinary\u2014a vast chamber where several stalagmites had been deliberately broken. Most of the 400 pieces had been arranged into two rings\u2014a large one between 4 and 7 metres across, and a smaller one just 2 metres wide. Others had been propped up against these donuts. Yet others had been stacked into four piles. Traces of fire were everywhere, and there was a mass of burnt bones.", "These weren\u2019t natural formations, and they weren\u2019t the work of bears. They were built by people. Recognizing the site\u2019s value, the caver brought in archaeologist Francois Rouzaud. Using carbon-dating, Rouzaud estimated that a burnt bear bone found within the chamber was 47,600 years old, which meant that the stalagmite rings were older than any known cave painting. It also meant that they couldn\u2019t have been the work of Homo sapiens. Their builders must have been the only early humans in the south of France at the time: Neanderthals. The discovery suggested that Neanderthals were more sophisticated than anyone had given them credit for. They wielded fire, ventured deep underground, and shaped the subterranean rock into complex constructions. Perhaps they even carried out rituals; after all, there was no evidence that anyone actually lived in the cave, so what else were the rings and mounds for? Rouzaud would never know. In April 1999, while guiding colleagues through a different cave, he suffered a fatal heart attack. With his death, work on the Bruniquel Cave ceased, and its incredible contents were neglected. They\u2019ve only now re-entered the limelight because Sophie Verheyden went on holiday. \"When I announced the age to Jacques, he asked me to repeat it because it was so incredible.\" A life-long caver, Verheyden works at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, where she specializes in stalagmites. She treats them as time capsules, using the chemicals within them to reconstruct the climate of past millennia. So when she learned about Bruniquel Cave, while visiting the region on holiday and seeing a display at a nearby castle, she had only one thought: Why hadn\u2019t anyone dated the broken stalagmites themselves?\"", "She knew that Rouzaud\u2019s date of 47,600 years was impressive but suspect. Carbon-dating is only accurate for samples younger than 50,000 years, so the Bruniquel material was hitting the technique\u2019s limits. They could well have been much older. To get a better estimate, Verheyden assembled a team including archaeologist Jacques Jaubert and fellow stalagmite expert Dominique Genty. In 2013, they got permission to study the site and crawled into it themselves. \"I\u2019m not very big, and I had to put one arm before me and one behind to get through,\" says Verheyden. \"It\u2019s kind of magical, even without the structures.\" After drilling into the stalagmites and pulling out cylinders of rock, the team could see an obvious transition between two layers. On one side were old minerals that were part of the original stalagmites; on the other were newer layers that had been laid down after the fragments were broken off by the cave\u2019s former users. By measuring uranium levels on either side of the divide, the team could accurately tell when each stalagmite had been snapped off for construction. Their date? 176,500 years ago, give or take a few millennia. \"When I announced the age to Jacques, he asked me to repeat it because it was so incredible,\" says Verheyden. Outside Bruniquel Cave, the earliest, unambiguous human constructions are just 20,000 years old. Most of these are ruins\u2014collapsed collections of mammoth bones and deer antlers. By comparison, the Bruniquel stalagmite rings are well-preserved and far more ancient.", "And if Rouzaud\u2019s work made it unlikely that modern humans built the rings, Verheyden\u2019s study grinds that possibility into the dust. Neanderthals must have been responsible. There simply wasn\u2019t any other hominin in that region at that time. \"When you see such a structure so far into the cave, you think of something cultural or religious.\" Why did they build the rings and mounds? The structures weren\u2019t foundations for huts; the chamber contains no stone tools, human bones, or any other sign of permanent occupation, and besides, why build shelter inside a cave? \"A plausible explanation is that this was a meeting place for some type of ritual social behavior,\" says Paola Villa from the University of Colorado Museum. \"When you see such a structure so far into the cave, you think of something cultural or religious, but that\u2019s not proven,\" adds Verheyden. Indeed, despite some fanciful speculations about cave bear cults, no one really knows. Nor is it clear how the Neanderthals made the structures. Verheyden says it couldn\u2019t have been one lone artisan, toiling away in the dark. Most likely, there was a team, and a technically skilled one at that. They broke rocks deliberately, and arranged them precisely. They used fire, too. More than 120 fragments have red and black streaks that aren\u2019t found elsewhere in the chamber or the cave beyond. They were the result of deliberately applied heat, at intensities strong enough to occasionally crack the rock. \"The Neanderthal group responsible for these constructions had a level of social organization that was more complex than previously thought,\" the team writes."], "targetTitle": "A Shocking Find in a Neanderthal Cave in France", "targetDescription": "A rock structure, built deep underground, is one of the earliest hominin constructions ever found.", "targetKeywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "targetMedia": ["http://atlanticmedia.122.2o7.net/b/ss/atlanticprod/1/H.23.6--NS/0", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6463921&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1407501962855831&ev=NoScript", "http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-906344h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-b0K-eQJGBXxXE.gif", "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/None/_R7A6312_1/headshot.jpg?1485193950", "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/05/CNRS_20160048_0006/facebook.jpg?1464180693", "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/05/CNRS_20160048_0006/lead_960.jpg?1464180693", "http://atlanticmedia.122.2o7.net/b/ss/atlanticprod/1/H.22--NS/0"], "targetUrl": "http://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/05/the-astonishing-age-of-a-neanderthal-cave-construction-site/484070/", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "Deliberately broken stalagmites arranged in rings", "spoilerPublisher": "savedyouaclick"}, "spoiler": ["a vast chamber where several stalagmites had been deliberately broken.

This is what they do. They are prolific and ruthless \u2014 a juggernaut of the highest order.", "If anything, the Warriors have given the Cavs opportunities in the first two games of the series: In Game 1, the Splash Brothers combined to shoot 30 percent from the floor and the Warriors only made nine 3-pointers total. In Game 2, Golden State turned the ball over 20 times.", "Those were windows \u2014 the cracks might have been small, but there was a gap there, and the Cavs couldn't take advantage of it. The simple truth loomed too large.", "The Warriors made 15 3-pointers while the Cavs made 5 on Sunday, a difference of 30 points in a 33-point Warriors win \u2014 the seventh-largest margin of victory in NBA Finals history.", "The Cavs came into Sunday's game saying they were going to shoot more 3-pointers, that they were going to go back to playing the style that pushed them through the Eastern Conference Playoffs with ease.", "It was going to be hard \u2014 coach Tyronn Lue was clearly fond of telling reporters over the two-day gap between Games 1 and 2 that it's nearly impossible to create ball movement against the Warriors' defense, which switches assignments at all five positions \u2014 but the Cavs had to try, it was the only path to victory.", "Instead, the Cavs shot two more 3-pointers in Game 2 compared to Game 1. They made two fewer. Overall, Cleveland is 12-of-44 from beyond the arc in this series, while J.R. Smith, the team's most prolific 3-point shooter, has made only two shots from distance in the Finals and is shooting a 3-pointer once every 10 minutes he's on the court. The Warriors are smothering him, and he's not a dynamic enough player to create his own shot -- at least not an effective one.", "How do the Cavs win a game in this series? It certainly appears that it's going to take some impressive changes and adjustments to do so \u2014 the kind of changes that look beyond Lue, who inexplicably blamed not getting to 50-50 balls and not making the \"tougher plays\" as the reasons behind his team's blowout loss Sunday.", "Not being beaten in every single aspect of the game, as LeBron James said in his postgame press conference \u2014 50-50 balls.", "The Cavaliers are in the deepest 2-0 hole in NBA Finals history \u2014 the Warriors' 48-point differential is the largest ever through two games \u2014 and it has almost nothing to do with 50-50 balls.", "It has to do with the Warriors' elite defense. It has to do with the Warriors' bench being worthy of a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. It has to do with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love being underachieving one-way players in a series that demands two-way play against a team that has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that they'll exploit weak defenders with cruel efficiency. It has to do with the Cavs needing J.R. Smith to be a consistent offensive producer on a nightly basis if they plan on winning. It has to do with the Cavs daring Draymond Green to beat them and then him doing just that. It has to do with Cleveland changing its offensive system and defensive ideology on the fly against perhaps the greatest team of all-time.", "It has to do with the simple truth that 3 is greater than 2.", "The Cavs clearly haven't learned that lesson yet, and unless a truly unpredictable turnaround is looming, it's too late for them to do anything about it."], "targetTitle": "The simple reason the

The food then mysteriously appears on location in a glass \"cubby\" displaying the customer's name, and they're free to chow down. This means no lines, no counter and no human conversation, because what could be worse? ", "The concept, while intriguing, also sounds a bit terrifying. So with a mind full of skepticism Mashable headed down to the newly opened Midtown Manhattan location to see what all the hype is about.", "While one might assume a cashier-free environment would be completely devoid of human interaction, that was far from the case. Though I initially feared the establishment would have a lifeless art gallery-esque vibe, the music was pumping, the customers were chatting and upon walking into the sleek restaurant I was instantly greeted by a friendly Eatsa \"mascot.\"", "Much like Apple Geniuses, Eatsa has several employees stationed on the floor to offer customer assistance and ensure you're not entirely left alone. \"There are always people on the floor \u2014 our mascots, we call them \u2014 and we\u2019re out here helping the guests and getting them through the process,\" explained Scott Bruggman, an Eatsa corporate trainer who began as an R&D chef creating bowls.", "To the right of the wood-floored room stood a row of electronic ordering kiosks, and to the left, the restaurant had several tables for those who wanted to engage in a slightly more familiar dining experience. This all felt relatively tame, but the back of the restaurant held the real magic: a wall made entirely of electronic, microwave-looking cubbies that would reveal your mysteriously prepared meal. Zap. ", "Since there was no one to take my order, I made my way to the kiosk to choose from the customizable bowls, bites and beverages on Eatsa's strictly vegetarian menu. Once I put in my request for a Hummus & Falafel Bowl, I walked toward the illuminated cubbies and within minutes my name was displayed on the screen above them, alerting me that my order was up. This was the moment of truth.", "Right before your food arrives in your cubby, Eatsa fills you with intrigue. Your cubby turns completely dark to prevent you from seeing the secrets of the kitchen and tantalizingly displays the words, \"It's coming.\" After you're given a playful peek at your meal, the cubby gives you the literal green light and you can receive your meal by tapping the glass twice.", "TBH, it felt like something straight out of The Jetsons.", "The process was quick, simple and the food was fresh, as promised.", "Though I was satisfied with the space-age experience, I couldn't stop wondering what the hell was going on behind that wall of mystery. I turned to Dean Marsh, director of market operations for the East Coast for some answers, but was kindly shut down. Marsh adamantly explained that much like the secrecy of costumed characters at Disney World, the public is not supposed to know what truly goes on in the depths of the Eatsa kitchen.", "Very ominous.", "Despite the attempt to keep the tricks of the trade to themselves, many believe that several human chefs work alongside robots. \"The Eatsa bots are back there,\" Bruggman said. \"There\u2019s a lot of different things going on and we use as much technology as we can to better enhance the experience.\"", "First-time customers and vegetarians Madee Bryke and her boyfriend Andrew Powell also had their theories. \"There are people back there; I know that,\" Bryke said. \"I think it\u2019s fun that there\u2019s robots, but there are definitely people still working.\"", "As of right now, Bruggman described the tech and human ratio as \"a real blend \u2014 that\u2019s how we make it so fast and so quick.\"", "With the rise of technology creating strong barriers against personal interaction, one of the major concerns the innovative restaurant raises is that the lack of human interaction may come across as too impersonal.", "While this may seen like a dream for introverts, surprisingly, the futuristic vibe only made things more fun. Millennials, such as Sabina M. who works a few blocks away and was eating there for the second day in a row, felt that if anything, the environment was encouraging people to be more social. \"Maybe it\u2019s just because of the novelty,\" she said, \"but it seems like people are almost more social here cause everyone\u2019s like woah this is crazy. So it\u2019s kind of getting people to talk to one another.\" ", "Bryke and Powell, also millennials, agreed. \"I definitely think it almost opens it up to more talk, it seems like they have a community,\" Bryke said.", "Her boyfriend, Powell, said that when you think about it, the automated restaurant is not much different from other forms of take-out. \"People already order Seamless and then go pick it up from a delivery guy so how is this much different? It\u2019s almost like a robot\u2019s making it anyways.\"", "To get a sense of how the older demographic was feeling about the revolutionary service, Gen X-er and first-time customer, Maarten Nederlof gave Mashable his two-cents. \"We\u2019re a little older and have been watching the whole decline in social interaction,\" he said. \"So this is a walk on the non-interacting side for us, but I think for younger people who have no social interaction, coming here is a great avoidance scheme.\"", "Nederlof explained that there are still tables, so people getting food can sit down inside and socialize. Therefore it's the best of both worlds. \"Are you really missing out on that much?\" he questioned. ", "Marsh, director of market operations for Easta, feels the restaurant's technology is actually giving people more time to engage in social interaction. \"Where you may spend 15 to 20 minutes at any of our competitors getting in and out with the regular fast food concept, for us it's three to four minutes. We feel that extra time gives you even more time interact with people,\" he said. ", "Though the Manhattan Eatsa has only been open for a few days, the restaurant's unique style is receiving a lot of love (just like like the five other locations in California and D.C.)", "\"Every restaurant competitor on the street has been in at least two times and we\u2019ve only been open for two days. We\u2019ve gotten a lot of interest from the big boys: the McDonalds and Starbucks of the world,\" he said.", "What's next? Perhaps an automated restaurant to please all the meat-eaters out there."], "targetTitle": "Waiter-less, cashier-less restaurant is the stuff of the future", "targetDescription": "We've seen the future of fast food and it's full of secretive cooking, utensils popping out of walls and a whole lot of quinoa.", "targetKeywords": "new-york, conversations, food, restaurant, tech", "targetMedia": null, "targetUrl": null, "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": null, "spoilerPublisher": null}, "spoiler": ["robots"], "spoilerPositions": [[[2, 179], [2, 185]]], "tags": ["phrase"], "predicted_labels": 1}

Many were worried that the deal would both ruin beloved Marvel characters like Iron Man and damage Disney's financial standing and stock valuation. Fast forward to 2016, and Disney's acquisition could very well be one of the best things to happen to both the media giant and the comic book publisher.", "However, it looks like the MCU is quickly coming to an end, at least as we know it. In an interview with IGN , Anthony Russo-who will be directing the upcoming Avengers films with his brother Joe-said that \"these two movies are intended to be the culmination of everything that has happened in the MCU since the very first Iron Man movie...In being a culmination, these movies are in some ways going to be an end to certain things, and in some ways, they're going to be the beginning of certain things.\"", "With this in mind, how much money has Marvel grossed at the total worldwide box office? And how much more can it bring in? Let's break it down:", "Phase One", "Iron Man - $585,174,222", "The Incredible Hulk - $263,427,551", "Iron Man 2 , bringing in $623,933,331", "Thor - $449,326,618", "Captain America: The First Avenger - $370,569,774", "The Avengers - $1,518,594,910", "Phase Two", "Iron Man 3 - $1,518,594,910", "Thor: The Dark World - $644,783,140", "Captain America: The Winter Soldier - $714,121,534", "Guardians of the Galaxy - $774,176,600", "Avengers: Age of Ultron - $1,398,858,115", "Ant-Man - $518,585,201", "Phase Three", "Phase three is just in its beginning stage, but will wrap up by 2019. The first of the last 10 films of the MCU, Captain America: Civil War , brought in almost $1.5 billion worldwide during its theatrical release.", "Audiences can look forward to Doctor Strange hitting theaters this fall; Guardians of the Galaxy 2 , Spider-Man: Homecoming , and Thor: Ragnarok debuting in 2017; Black Panther , Avengers: Infinity War , and Ant-Man and the Wasp premiering in 2018; and Captain Marvel and the untitled Avengers sequel coming to theaters in 2019.", "The Marvel Effect", "As of now, the MCU has grossed $10,527,843,932 at the box office, and if the next nine films can live up to each of their respective predecessors, the franchise could very well double, and even triple, its worldwide earnings. Both of the next Avengers films could easily make $1 billion each, and if the next Guardians , Thor , and Ant-Man movies follow in common sequel fashion, they could all make well over their originals' total earnings.", "Predicting gross profit from films is difficult, as Hollywood accounting is notoriously complicated, but it is safe to argue that Marvel has proven to be the ultimate money maker.

Survey respondents were more likely to blame colleges for rising student debt if they were currently enrolled in school.", "The cost of a college degree has increased 12-fold in the last 30 years, while having such a degree has become even more important to those seeking full-time employment.

The U.S. Department of Education collected $42.5 billion from borrowers in fiscal year 2013 alone.", "Although O'Sullivan believes there's plenty of blame to go around, he was struck by how few placed responsibility on state governments, despite the connection between state legislative appropriations and tuition at public colleges. Only 8 percent of Harvard's survey respondents said state governments were to blame for rising student loan debt.", "A 2012 New York Federal Reserve study linked mounting tuition costs at public universities, where a majority of students get their degrees, to state budget cuts. A previous Huffington Post/YouGov poll found most Americans believe state universities are no longer affordable.", "\"We invest less than we used to, per student,\" O'Sullivan noted.", "Young Invincibles is currently working with student groups on campuses to raise awareness of how the state budget process affects their tuition bill.

She said she wanted to help people understand what happens to strays in Taiwan.", "Taiwan was gripped by anger and soul-searching in the weeks that followed, most of it focused on a life tragically cut short.", "But people also asked why frontline workers in Taiwan's battle against pet abandonment were being put under so much pressure.", "You might also be interested in", "In an interview Ms Chien once did with a local TV station CTI, she described the first time she saw an animal put down.", "\"I went home and cried all night,\" she said.", "But it was media appearances like this that meant she came under personal attack. When it was revealed she had put down 700 dogs in two years, she was labelled the \"beautiful slaughterer\".", "Shelter workers dreaded putting down the dogs, but Ms Chien and others saw this as a better end for the unwanted, ageing or difficult-to-adopt animals than leaving them at risk of disease in overcrowded shelters.", "\"They called her a butcher... We are frequently scolded. Some people say we'll go to hell. They say we love to kill and are cruel,\" said Kao Yu-jie, one of her co-workers.", "\"But people still abandon their dogs. You hear all kinds of reasons: their dog is too mean, or not mean enough, barks too much, or doesn't bark enough.\"", "High kill rate", "Taiwan has two main problems when it comes to animal welfare: the number of pets being abandoned and the number of strays allowed to reproduce.", "In reality, the situation has improved over the past decade thanks to increased public awareness and efforts by shelters and activists to discourage abandonment and encourage adoptions.", "But the number of animals put down remains high and shelters are still underfunded and understaffed. The work is difficult and hours long. In some shelters, half the animals are killed.", "In 2015 around 10,900 were put down. And about 8,600 shelter animals died last year from other causes, such as illness.", "In the CTI interview, Ms Chien described the process of putting a dog down.", "\"We first let it take a stroll and eat some snacks and talk to it. Then we take it into the 'humane room'.", "\"When you put it on the table, it's very scared and its whole body is shaking. But after we administer the drug, it leaves in three to five seconds. It no longer shakes. Actually, it's very sad.\"", "No psychological counselling was provided for the staff. Psychological support in this and other fields is practically unheard of in Taiwan.", "The Taoyuan shelter actually had one of the lowest euthanasia rates and highest adoption rates of any shelter.", "But a letter Ms Chien left behind when she killed herself suggested her concern for the welfare of the animals had consumed her. Her colleagues attest to this, although experts remind us that many and complex factors lie behind any suicide.", "\"She put herself under a lot of pressure. She cared a lot about the animals and the pressure from the work affected her,\" said Ms Lai.", "In the letter, Ms Chien wrote: \"I hope my departure will let all of you know stray animals are also life. I hope the government knows the importance of controlling the source [of the problem]... Please value life.\"", "The irony of her exhortation to value life was not lost on observers and blame was quick to be handed out.", "Newspapers accused the government of \"murdering\" her, with many saying it failed to come up with effective ways to stamp out pet abandonment or prevent strays from reproducing.", "Some accused \"higher-level bureaucrats\" of trying to convince the public that Ms Chien simply couldn't handle her work pressures. But other commentators said that while shelter workers were easy to target, all of society must take responsibility.", "Many believe the root of the problem is the insufficient enforcement of a neutering and spaying law.", "The chief of the animal protection section of the Council of Agriculture, Chiang Wen-chuan, said a law requiring spaying and neutering only recently came into effect, and doesn't allow staff to impose fines immediately.", "And even though staff pay visits to the owners of 60,000 animals each year to urge them to follow the laws, only 30% of the island's 1.7 million dogs have been spayed or neutered.", "\"We are very short-staffed. All of Taiwan only has 140 animal protection staff,\" said Mr Chiang. \"It's a systematic problem. Ending euthanasia and expanding shelters and staff will not solve the problem.\"", "Some Taiwanese also believe such medical procedures change the personality of their pets. Others want to breed to give to friends or sell.", "Short-term measures", "Ms Chien already knew, when she died, that a new law was coming into force.", "From 4 February 2017, it will be illegal to put down abandoned animals. Budgets have also increased by 40%, there will be more inspectors and now anybody who wishes to abandon their pet at a shelter will have to pay a fee as high as $125 (\u00a3100).", "The authorities say this is nothing to do with Ms Chien's suicide, and her story, which was simply a human tragedy.", "The government has pledged to increase funding and staffing at shelters and provide psychological counselling. But many see these as short-term measures.", "Activists want the government to crack down on breeders, implement subsidies for NGOs to spay and neuter, and provide assistance to groups that take in strays.", "Perhaps Ms Chien was not the catalyst for the changes, but her love for animals will not be forgotten by her husband, also an animal control worker, and her colleagues - all of whom were left pain-stricken by her death."], "targetTitle": "The vet who 'euthanised' herself in Taiwan", "targetDescription": "The BBC looks back at the suicide of a vet in Taiwan, as new animal laws are set to come in.", "targetKeywords": "", "targetMedia": null, "targetUrl": null, "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": null, "spoilerPublisher": null}, "spoiler": ["On 5 May last year, Ms Chien took her own life, using the same drug she used to put down animals.

I was just forcefully saying, you know, \u2018You\u2019re a Chinese kid.\u2019\"", "Calvin associated with few other Asian students in his social circle and while he maintained good grades, his passion wasn\u2019t academics.

And often, it\u2019s a calling because you find a deep sense of purpose and positive impact in your role. And fortunately, the data show that purpose is incredibly tied to both business and personal success. In Corporate Culture and Performance, authors John Kotter and James Heskett write that purposeful, value-based companies outperform their counterparts with 400% higher revenues, 700% greater job growth and 1,200% higher stock prices. But having purpose doesn\u2019t only impact the organization you work for; it also impacts you. Research from the Hay Group shows that highly engaged employees are, on average, 50% more likely to exceed expectations than their least engaged counterparts. As a result, I believe that, to be both successful and fulfilled, it is crucial to understand what purpose means to you.", "Granted, finding your purpose is a proactive pursuit. Many people start to explore their feelings when they\u2019re unhappy, dissatisfied with their job and/or upset with their personal life. But it is important to find time to reflect when you find yourself in a good place, too. When you\u2019re experiencing fulfillment and joy in your work or in your personal life, take a moment to ask yourself, \"What am I doing right now that is making me fulfilled?\" Are you helping someone? Are you coding? Are you being creative? Are you creating the best financial model the world has ever seen? The answers to this question often bring to the surface what is important to you and can help you recreate that satisfaction moving forward.", "I\u2019ve also found it helpful to create a personal vision for your life. Spend some time thinking about what your ideal day would be like. I keep a \"dream book\" myself, and I\u2019ve filled it with things that are important to me\u2014from building a great tech company that is tackling a hard but important problem to building and maintaining lifelong friendships to checking items off of my travel bucket list. It even includes a picture of a well-landscaped backyard because that\u2019s been on my list of projects to tackle\u2014and trust me, you need vision to see beyond the weeds that are back there today.", "So spend time creating a vision for your life. Ask yourself key questions about the role that purpose will play. Trust me, your vision can and will change over time. But knowing what you want your life to look like and then working to establish annual, monthly or even daily goals and habits to help you live that life\u2014in and out of the workplace\u2014is absolutely key to success.

The complaints allege that its upstart rival's cameras can lose about 5 frames per minute. The suits come two weeks after Vievu sued Taser on the claim that the company had illegally lobbied officials in the city of Phoenix to abandon a $3.6 million camera contract that Vievu had recently won.", "The body-camera war has also included skirmishes in New York City, where Vievu's win of a $6.4 million body camera contract sparked similar accusations about the quality of its products and a fierce lobbying campaign by Taser.

Many stressed out people have trouble falling asleep because they feel the weight of these symptoms most heavily at night.", "Best-selling author Dr. Andrew Weil, who received his M.D. from Harvard University in 1968, is a huge advocate of the benefits of holistic breathing practices in combatting stress and anxiety. On his website , Dr. Weil writes:", "\"Breathing strongly influences physiology and thought processes, including moods. By simply focusing your attention on your breathing, and without doing anything to change it, you can move in the direction of relaxation.\"", "Because the effects of stress include quick and shallow breaths that stem almost exclusively from the upper chest, perpetually stressed and anxious people are actually in the detrimental habit of under-breathing. Many stressed people are even known for subconsciously holding their breath.", "That being said, mindful breathing practices are noticeably absent from the vast majority of Western medicine. Those most familiar with the relationship between breathing and the body tend to be yogis and practitioners of Eastern wellness methodologies.", "How to Do The \"4-7-8\u2032\u2032 Exercise", "Dr. Weil is an influential public supporter of a previously little-known breathing technique known as the \"4-7-8 exercise.\" This trick, which began to capture national attention several years ago and has since been the subject of innumerable headlines, including one on Oprah.com , is shockingly simple, takes hardly any time, and can be done pretty much anywhere.", "Here is how you do the exercise:", "Place the tip of your tongue against the tissue ridge right above your upper front teeth. Keep it there for the remainder of the exercise. Exhale completely through your mouth, making a whoosh sound as you do so. Close your mouth and inhale slowly through your nose while mentally counting to four. Hold your breath for a mental count of seven. Exhale completely through your mouth for a mental count of eight. Make the same whoosh sound from Step Two. This concludes the first cycle. Repeat the same process three more times for a total of four renditions.", "In a nutshell: breathe in for four, hold for seven, and breathe out for eight. You must inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. The four-count inhale allows chronic under-breathers to take in more oxygen. The seven-count hold gives the oxygen more time to thoroughly permeate the bloodstream, and the eight-count exhale slows the heart rate and releases a greater amount of carbon dioxide from the lungs.", "Alina Gonzalez, who wrote \" How I Learned to Fall Asleep in Under 1 Minute \" for Byrdie.com, says that 4-7-8 helped her fall asleep amid her nerves and severe anxiety the week before she was scheduled to give the bridesmaid speech at her best friend\u2019s wedding.", "When Gonzalez told her friend that she was having trouble getting to sleep due to a combination of stress and pre-wedding jitters, the bride-to-be, who was a licensed wellness practitioner, told her that the 4-7-8 technique would change her life.

Like so many others who swear by this method, the originally skeptical Gonzalez wakes up each morning to the incredulous realization that s he does not even remember completing the final 4-7-8 cycle because it put her to sleep so quickly.", "The 4-7-8 exercise certainly has the potential to help overly stressed, anxiety-ridden Millennials (as well as members of the general population at large) fall asleep more quickly.

(Photo: Ron Jenkins/Getty Images)", "Last week, Kenneth W. Starr was stripped of his title as president of Baylor University after an independent investigation found that the university had mishandled sexual assault accusations against football players. Football head coach Art Briles was also fired as a result of the investigation. Starr, who will continue to serve as both chancellor and a law professor, gained notoriety as an independent counsel for his investigation of President Bill Clinton, the New York Times reports:", "Mr. Starr\u2019s demotion delivered a twist to the biography of a man whose reputation was built on what many considered an overzealous pursuit of allegations of sexual transgressions by Mr. Clinton. Now he is being punished for leading an administration that, according to a report from an ostensibly independent investigator, looked the other way when Baylor football players were accused of sex crimes, and sometimes convicted of them.", "The relationship between athletes and sexual assault is a decades-old discussion. Since at least the 1980s, high-profile rape cases involving famous athletes have led the press to speculate on whether players might be more prone to committing acts of sexual violence. A string of sexual assault allegations in recent years has ensured that college athletic programs and the athletes that populate them will remain in the spotlight. In the last two years alone, players from the University of Tennessee-Knoxville, Florida State University, and the University of Oregon have made headlines for assault allegations. More than 160 higher education institutions are under investigation by the Department of Education\u2019s Office of Civil Rights for sexual violence allegations. But are athletes actually more likely to commit sexual assaults, or are we just more likely to pay attention when they\u2019re the ones accused of committing the crime?", "One factor to consider is that sexual violence does not occur in a vacuum. Anthropological research suggests that, rather than a purely psychological- or biological-driven act, sexual assaults are also highly influenced by culture. Peggy Sanday, an emeritus professor of anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania, found that some societies are more prone to rape than others; tribal societies with higher levels of male dominance, sex segregation, and tolerance of interpersonal violence had higher rates of rape. In other words, some environments can encourage sexual aggression.", "The recent investigation into Baylor concluded that university officials \"created a cultural perception that football was above the rules.\"", "College athletics are highly sex segregated, extremely male dominated, and, at least in the case of some sports \u2014 football and hockey, for example \u2014 violent by design. While no university could be accused of explicitly encouraging sexual assault, several have been blamed for condoning such behaviors, or sweeping assault allegations under the rug. The recent investigation into Baylor, for example, concluded that university officials \"created a cultural perception that football was above the rules.\"", "And the perceived lack of consequences for star athletes might embolden them to behave in sexually aggressive ways. Consider surveys that have found that between one in six and one in three men would be willing to \"use force\" to obtain sex from women as long as there were no consequences for their actions.", "While members of sports teams \u2014 and other male-dominated groups like fraternities and the military \u2014 are indeed more likely to commit gang rapes than the average person, there are few conclusive studies to show that athletes are more likely to commit sex crimes. There is some evidence that not all athletes are equally likely to be violent, according to Laura Finley, a sociologist at Barry University. Finley told Wisconsin Public Radio that players of \"power and performance sports\" \u2014 football, hockey, wrestling, and basketball \u2014 commit violent crimes more often that their peers in sports like swimming or tennis. An analysis of National Football League players by Benjamin Morris at FiveThirtyEight showed that, though the football stars displayed lower levels of domestic and sexual violence than the national average, the rate of domestic violence was still much higher than expected given their income bracket.", "Without better data, it\u2019s hard to say anything definitive on the matter. Even the oft-cited statistic that one in three sexual assaults on college campuses are carried out by athletes dates back not to a scientific study, but to a 1986 Philadelphia Daily News article. (One 1995 study did, however, find that male athletes were overrepresented in reports of sexual assault on campuses.) Literature reviews, which are usually useful for identifying patterns in the sea of conflicting single studies that science produces, are also unreliable here: One recent review found that the bulk of research on the subject was inconclusive; another, however, found higher rates of violence among student athletes.", "We can at least say with certainty that universities have not been effective in handling the cases of sexual misconduct by athletes. A 2014 survey found that, in more than one-fifth of universities, the athletic department oversaw cases involving sexual assault allegations against athletes, prompting the National Collegiate Athletic Association to issue a resolution that athletic departments can only participate in, but never lead, investigations into such allegations. Still, the recent investigation at Baylor found that the university\u2019s football program frequently dealt with sexual assault allegations internally."], "targetTitle": "Are Student Athletes More Likely to Commit Sexual Assault?", "targetDescription": "An investigation found that Baylor University had mishandled sexual assault accusations against its football players.

They recommend voting for a third-party or write-in candidate.", "As a professor who has taught Christian ethics for 39 years, I think their analysis is incorrect. Now that Trump has won the GOP nomination, I think voting for Trump is a morally good choice.", "American citizens need patience with each other in this difficult political season. Close friends are inevitably going to make different decisions about the election. We still need to respect each other and thank God that we live in a democracy with freedom to differ about politics. And we need to keep talking with each other \u2013 because democracies function best when thoughtful citizens can calmly and patiently dialog about the reasons for their differences. This is my contribution to that discussion.", "A good candidate with flaws", "I do not think that voting for Donald Trump is a morally evil choice because there is nothing morally wrong with voting for a flawed candidate if you think he will do more good for the nation than his opponent. In fact, it is the morally right thing to do.", "I did not support Trump in the primary season. I even spoke against him at a pastors\u2019 conference in February. But now I plan to vote for him. I do not think it is right to call him an \"evil candidate.\" I think rather he is a good candidate with flaws.", "He is egotistical, bombastic, and brash. He often lacks nuance in his statements. Sometimes he blurts out mistaken ideas (such as bombing the families of terrorists) that he later must abandon. He insults people. He can be vindictive when people attack him. He has been slow to disown and rebuke the wrongful words and actions of some angry fringe supporters. He has been married three times and claims to have been unfaithful in his marriages. These are certainly flaws, but I don\u2019t think they are disqualifying flaws in this election.", "On the other hand, I think some of the accusations hurled against him are unjustified. His many years of business conduct show that he is not racist or anti-(legal) immigrant or anti-Semitic or misogynistic \u2013 I think these are unjust magnifications by a hostile press exaggerating some careless statements he has made. I think he is deeply patriotic and sincerely wants the best for the country. He has been an unusually successful problem solver in business. He has raised remarkable children. Many who have known him personally speak highly of his kindness, thoughtfulness, and generosity. But the main reason I call him \"a good candidate with flaws\" is that I think most of the policies he supports are those that will do the most good for the nation.", "Seek the good of the nation", "Should Christians even try to influence elections at all? Yes, definitely. The apostle Peter says Christians are \"exiles\" on this earth (1 Peter 1:1). Therefore I take seriously the prophet Jeremiah\u2019s exhortation to the Jewish people living in exile in Babylon:", "\"Seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the LORD on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare\" (Jeremiah 29:7).", "By way of modern application, I think Christians today have a similar obligation to vote in such a way that will \"seek the welfare\" of the United States. Therefore the one overriding question to ask is this: Which vote is most likely to bring the best results for the nation?", "If this election is close (which seems likely), then if someone votes for a write-in candidate instead of voting for Trump, this action will directly help Hillary Clinton, because she will need one less vote to win. Therefore the question that Christians should ask is this: Can I in good conscience act in a way that helps a liberal like Hillary Clinton win the presidency?", "Under President Obama, a liberal federal government has seized more and more control over our lives. But this can change. This year we have an unusual opportunity to defeat Hillary Clinton and the pro-abortion, pro-gender-confusion, anti-religious liberty, tax-and-spend, big government liberalism that she champions. I believe that defeating that kind of liberalism would be a morally right action. Therefore I feel the force of the words of James: \"Whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin\" (James 4:17).", "Some may feel it is easier just to stay away from this messy Trump-Clinton election, and perhaps not even vote. But the teachings of Scripture do not allow us to escape moral responsibility by saying that we decided to do nothing. The prophet Obadiah rebuked the people of the Edom for standing by and doing nothing to help when the Babylonians conquered Jerusalem: \"On the day that you stood aloof, on the day that . . . foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem, you were like one of them.\" (Obadiah 1:11).", "I am writing this article because I doubt that many \"I can\u2019t vote for Trump\" Christians have understood what an entirely different nation would result from Hillary Clinton as president, or have analyzed in detail how different a Trump presidency would be. In what follows, I will compare the results we could expect from a Clinton presidency with what we could expect from a Trump presidency.", "The Supreme Court with Clinton as president", "Hillary Clinton would quickly replace Justice Scalia with another liberal like Breyer, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan. This would give liberals a 5-4 majority on the Supreme Court even without Justice Kennedy, and 6-3 when he votes with them.", "But that is not all. Justice Ginsburg is 83, and she has had colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, and has a heart stent. Justice Kennedy is 80. Justice Breyer is 78. A President Clinton could possibly nominate three or four justices to the Supreme Court, locking in a far-left activist judiciary for perhaps 30 or more years. She could also add dozens of activist judges to federal district courts and courts of appeals, the courts where 99% of federal lawsuits are decided. Judicial tyranny of the type we have seen when abortion rights and same-sex marriage were forced on the nation would gain a permanent triumph.", "The nation would no longer be ruled by the people and their elected representatives, but by unelected, unaccountable, activist judges who would dictate from the bench about whatever they were pleased to decree. And there would be nothing in our system of government that anyone could do to stop them.", "That is why this election is not just about Hillary Clinton. It is about defeating the far left liberal agenda that any Democratic nominee would champion. Liberal Democrats are now within one Supreme Court justice of their highest goal: gaining permanent control of the nation with a five vote majority on the Supreme Court, and then relentlessly imposing every liberal policy on the nation not through winning elections but through a relentless parade of one Supreme Court decision after another.", "Even if Clinton were to drop out of the race (perhaps due to additional shocking email disclosures, for example), our choice in the election would be just the same, because any other Democratic nominee would appoint the same kind of liberal justices to the Court.", "Abortion", "On abortion, a liberal court would probably find the ban on partial-birth abortion to be unconstitutional (it was upheld by only a 5-4 majority in Gonzalez v. Carhart, 2007). In addition, the court could find an absolute \"right to abortion\" in the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution and then sweep away with one decision most or all of the restrictions on abortion that pro-life advocates worked for tirelessly over the last 43 years, including ultrasound requirements, waiting periods, parental consent requirements, and prohibitions on non-doctors performing abortions.", "Voters should not doubt the power of the Supreme Court to abolish all these laws restricting abortions. Think of the power of the Obergefell v. Hodges 5-4 decision in June, 2015. It instantly nullified all the work that thousands of Christians had done over many years in persuading the citizens of 31 states to pass constitutional amendments defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman. But no one is campaigning for such laws or amendments anymore, because it would be futile. The Supreme Court has spoken, and therefore the issue is settled in the political system of the United States. We lost \u2013 not at the ballot box, but because we had a liberal Supreme Court that nullified the democratic process regarding the definition of marriage.", "So it would certainly be with any efforts to place legal limitations on abortion. Nobody would campaign any more for laws to limit abortions, because any such laws would be unconstitutional. The legislative lobbying work of pro-life advocacy groups would be totally and utterly defeated. Millions of unborn children would continue to die.", "Religious liberty", "The current liberal agenda often includes suppressing Christian opposition to its views. So a liberal court would increasingly nullify rights of conscience with respect to forced participation in same-sex marriage ceremonies or expressing moral objections to homosexual conduct. Already Christians are being pushed out of many occupations. Florists, bakers, and professional photographers have had their businesses destroyed by large fines for refusal to contribute their artistic talents to a specific event, a same-sex wedding ceremony to which they had moral objections.", "Fire Chief Kelvin Cochran in Atlanta was removed from his job because of self-publishing a religious book that briefly mentioned the Bible\u2019s teachings regarding non-marital sexual conduct, including homosexuality, amidst a host of other topics. His situation holds ominous implications for any Christians who hold public sector jobs. In our military services, many high-ranking officers have quietly been forced to resign because they were unwilling to give support to the homosexual agenda.", "Mozilla/Firefox CEO Brendan Eich was pushed out from his own company merely because he had donated money to Proposition 8 in California, supporting marriage between one man and one woman. This event has troubling implications for Christians in any corporate executive role who dare to support a political position contrary to the liberal agenda.", "Last year Boston urologist Paul Church, a Harvard Medical School faculty member, lost his hospital privileges at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center because he had expressed concerns about the medical dangers associated with same-sex activity.", "Are my predictions about this kind of loss of religious liberty too grim? The three conservative justices still on the Supreme Court expressed similar concerns just last month. The case concerned a Washington pharmacy that has been owned for 70 years by the Stormans family, who are committed Christians. They will likely now be put out of business by the Washington State Pharmacy Board for refusing to dispense an abortion-causing prescription drug. On June 28, 2016, the Supreme Court refused to hear the Stormans\u2019 appeal, in spite of the strong dissent written by Justice Alito (joined by Roberts and Thomas):", "\"At issue are Washington State regulations that are likely to make a pharmacist unemployable if he or she objects on religious grounds to dispensing certain prescription medications. . . . . there is much evidence that the impetus for the adoption of the regulations was hostility to pharmacists whose religious beliefs regarding abortion and contraception are out of step with prevailing opinion in the State . . . . If this is a sign of how religious liberty claims will be treated in the years ahead, those who value religious freedom have cause for great concern.\" (italics added)", "Christian business owners", "If Clinton appoints just one more liberal justice, it is likely that many Christian business owners will be targeted. Hobby Lobby won its 2014 Supreme Court case (again 5-4), so it was not compelled to dispense abortifacients to its employees, but that case could be reversed (the four liberal justices in the minority, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, are still on the court). If that case is overturned, it would force Hobby Lobby out of business, because the Green family had said they would shut down the company of 23,000 employees and over $3 billion in annual sales if they lost the decision. The implications for other Christian business owners with pro-life convictions are ominous.", "These incidents show that it is not an exaggeration to say that, under a liberal Supreme Court resulting from Hillary Clinton\u2019s election, Christians would increasingly experience systematic exclusion from hundreds of occupations, with thousands of people losing their jobs. Step-by-step, Christians would increasingly be marginalized to the silent fringes of society. Is withholding a vote from Donald Trump important enough to pay this high a price in loss of freedom?", "Some Christians have even hinted to me that \"persecution would be good for us.\" But the Bible never encourages us to seek persecution or hope for it. We should rather work to prevent such oppression of Christians, just as Jesus taught us to pray, \"Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil\" (Matthew 6:13). Paul did not encourage us to pray that God would give us bad rulers but good ones who would allow us to live a peaceful life:", "\"I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, 2 for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way.\" (1Timothy 2:1)", "Christian schools and colleges", "A liberal Supreme Court would also impact education. Christian colleges would likely be found guilty of \"discrimination\" if they required adherence to the Bible\u2019s standards regarding sexual conduct, or even required affirmation of primary Christian beliefs. Campus ministries like Cru and InterVarsity have already been forced off of many university campuses following the 5-4 Supreme Court decision CLS v. Martinez (2010), which upheld the exclusion of the Christian Legal Society from the campus of Hastings College of Law in San Francisco. And now California\u2019s Equity in Higher Education Act (SB 1146), which recently passed the California state senate and will likely become law, would prohibit Christian colleges from requiring students or employees to hold Christian beliefs or abide by biblical moral standards regarding sexual conduct, and would prohibit colleges from assigning housing based on a student\u2019s biological sex if a student claimed to be transgender. Colleges like Biola and Azusa Pacific could not long survive under those regulations.", "With regard to elementary and high schools, laws promoting school choice or tuition voucher programs would likely be declared unconstitutional if they allowed such funding to go to Christian schools. A tax credit program for scholarships to private schools, including Christian institutions, was only upheld by a 5-4 Supreme Court decision in Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn in 2011, and all four liberal justices who voted against it are still on the court. Another possible target of the liberal agenda would be laws that allow for home schooling, if the secular/ liberal governmental hostility to home schooling in European countries is any indicator.", "Churches", "Churches would not be exempt from the impact of a liberal Supreme Court. The court could rule that any school district is allowed to ban churches from renting school buildings on Sundays, an action that could severely hinder the work of small churches and church planting in general. (This was already the ruling of the Second Circuit in the Bronx Household of Faith case regarding New York City public schools.) And some churches in Iowa have now been told that they have to make their bathrooms open to people on the basis of their \"gender identity\" if the churches are going to be open to the public at all.", "Freedom of speech", "Freedom of speech would be increasingly restricted in the public square. In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that prayers of visiting pastors who prayed \"in Jesus\u2019 name\" when they opened a city council meeting were allowed under the Constitution, but again it was a 5-4 decision (Town of Greece v. Galloway) and all four liberals who wanted to restrict such prayers are still on the court.", "Criminalizing dissent", "Another troubling possibility is that liberal activists, once in power, would further entrench themselves by criminalizing much political dissent. We have already seen it happen with the IRS targeting of conservative groups and with some state attorneys general taking steps to prosecute (!) groups who dare to disagree with activists\u2019 claims about the danger of man-made global warming.", "\"But my conscience won\u2019t let me vote for Donald Trump,\" some have told me. But I wonder if their consciences have considered the gravity of these destructive consequences that would come from a Clinton presidency. A vote for Trump would at least be doing something to prevent these things.", "In addition, I think there are several positive reasons to vote for Trump.", "The Supreme Court with Trump as president", "Trump has released a list of 11 judges to show the kind of nominee he would appoint to the Supreme Court. A lawyer familiar with many of these names has told me that they constitute a \"dream list\" of outstanding judges who would uphold the original meaning of the Constitution and would not create new laws from the bench. Trump has said he would rely primarily on advice from the Federalist Society, the organization that promotes the \"original meaning\" view so strongly exemplified by Justice Scalia before his death.", "If Trump would appoint a replacement for Scalia from his list of 11, and probably one or two other Supreme Court justices, then we could see a 5-4 or even 6-3 majority of conservative justices on the Supreme Court. The results for the nation would be overwhelmingly good.", "Such a Supreme Court would finally return control of the nation to the people and their elected representatives, removing it from dictatorial judges who repeatedly make law from the bench.", "Abortion", "Such a court would likely overturn Roe v. Wade and return abortion laws and the regulation of abortion to the states.", "Religious liberty", "A conservative court would vigorously uphold the First Amendment, protecting freedom of religion and freedom of speech for Christian colleges, Christian ministries, and churches.", "Such a court would likely overturn the horribly destructive decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971) that changed the meaning of the First Amendment and ruled that a government action \"must not have the primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion\" (note: not a specific denomination but \"religion\" in general). A conservative court would likely declare that the First Amendment was only intended to prohibit the establishment of a state-sponsored church or denomination.", "Such a decision would once again allow the nonsectarian affirmation of personal belief in God in public schools, would once again allow coaches to pray with their football teams before a game, and would allow visiting clergy to be invited to give a prayer at high school graduation ceremonies. It would also imply that nativity scenes without Santa Claus and Buddha should be allowed in government-owned parks and buildings at Christmas time. It wouldn\u2019t require these things, but would allow them if local officials chose to approve them. It would restore true freedom of religion as the First Amendment intended.", "It would also protect freedom of conscience for Christians who object to participating in abortions, or dispensing abortifacient medicines, or who do not wish to participate in same-sex wedding ceremonies. It is also possible that a conservative Supreme Court would eventually return control of marriage to the states.", "Freedom for Christian influence in politics", "Significantly, Trump has pledged to work to repeal the 1954 Johnson Amendment to the IRS code, which has been used for 62 years as a threat to silence pastors from speaking about political issues, for fear of losing their tax-exempt status. This would be a great victory for freedom of religion and freedom of speech.", "In short, a Trump-appointed Supreme Court, together with dozens of lower court judges appointed by him, would probably result in significant advances in many of the policy areas important to Christians. It would also open the door to huge expansion of influence for the many Christian lobbying groups known as \"family policy councils\" in various states, especially enabling them to work for further legal protections for life, for marriage and family, and for religious liberty.", "How can we know that Trump won\u2019t change his mind?", "\"But Trump has changed his mind in the past,\" a politically-minded friend said to me. \"How do you know that he will do what he has promised? Maybe he\u2019ll betray you and appoint a liberal Supreme Court justice.\"", "My reply is that we can never know the future conduct of any human being with 100% certainty, but in making an ethical decision like this one, we should base the decision on the most likely results. In this case, the most likely result is that Trump will do most or all of what he has said.", "In the history of American politics, candidates who have been elected president have occasionally changed their minds on one or another issue while in office, but no president has ever gone back on most of what he has promised to do, especially on issues that are crucially important in the election. In this election, it is reasonable to think that the most likely result is that both Trump and Clinton will do what they have promised to do. That is the basis on which we should decide how to vote.", "And notice how Trump has changed his mind. He continues to move in a more conservative direction, as evidenced by his list of judges and his choice for vice president. Just as he succeeded in business by listening to the best experts to solve each problem, I suspect that he has been learning from the best experts in conservative political thought and has increasingly found that conservative solutions really work. We should applaud these changes.", "His choice of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate is an especially significant indication that he will govern as a conservative. Trump could have picked a moderate but instead picked a lifelong solid conservative who is a thoughtful, gracious policy wizard. Pence is a lawyer and former talk radio host who served 12 years in Congress and had significant congressional leadership positions, so he will be immensely helpful in working with Congress. He is a committed evangelical Christian. He is a former board member of the Indiana Family Institute, a conservative Christian lobbying group in Indiana.", "However, the Supreme Court is not the only issue at stake in this election. While I disagree with Trump on a few things (especially trade policy), on most important issues, Trump will likely do much good for the nation.", "Taxes and jobs", "Trump has pledged to cut taxes significantly, while Clinton wants to raise them. Trump is advocating a 15% tax rate for corporations rather than the current 35%. Lower corporate taxes would lead to business expansion and a massive increase in available jobs and higher pay levels. For individual taxpayers, Trump favors a top rate of 25%, but for Clinton it\u2019s 45%. Most small businesses file under this individual rate, so once again Trump\u2019s lower taxes would result in substantial expansion of businesses and many more jobs. Finally our economy would snap out of its eight years of anemic growth.", "In my judgment, Christians should support lower tax rates that would lead to more jobs, because Obama\u2019s economic policies for the last eight years have hurt lower income and low-middle income families the most. Many can\u2019t even find jobs, and others can\u2019t find full-time jobs. Those who have jobs struggle to survive with no meaningful pay raises year after year. It is no surprise that these are the people who are supporting Trump in overwhelming numbers.", "Tax rates are also a good indicator of government control. Higher tax rates mean greater government control of our lives, while lower tax rates indicate greater freedom.", "Minorities", "Two of the deepest causes of poverty among minority groups and racial tensions in our country are failing public schools in our inner cities and lack of available jobs. Trump expressed a commitment to solve these problems at several points in his acceptance speech at the Republican convention. He pledged to reduce taxes and regulations, leading to many more jobs. And he said:", "\"Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African-American youth are not employed . . . . This administration has failed America\u2019s inner cities. It\u2019s failed them on education. It\u2019s failed and on jobs. It\u2019s failed them on crime . . . . Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this make life better for young Americans in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child in America? . . . . We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.\"", "By contrast, Clinton will bow to the teachers\u2019 unions and oppose school choice at every turn, and she will continue to strangle businesses with high taxes and regulations, preventing job growth.", "The military", "Trump has promised to rapidly rebuild our depleted military forces, but Clinton would continue the liberal policy of eviscerating them through denying funding. This is dangerous in light of increasing threats from China, Russia, Iran, and ISIS.", "Borders", "Trump has repeatedly promised that he will finally secure our borders, an urgent need to protect the nation from ever more terrorists and drug smugglers. Clinton will not do this but will continue to allow in what she thinks will be thousands of future Democratic voters.", "ISIS and terrorism", "Trump has pledged to aggressively attack and utterly defeat ISIS. Clinton will continue the anemic Obama policy of periodic bombing runs and drone attacks, under which ISIS has continued to thrive.", "China and Russia", "Trump will not let China and Russia and Iran push us around anymore, as Obama has done, with Hillary Clinton\u2019s support when she was secretary of state. If Trump is anything, he is tough as nails, and he won\u2019t be bullied.", "Israel", "Trump has promised to vigorously defend and support Israel, while Clinton will most likely continue the Obama administration\u2019s criticism, snubbing, and marginalization of Israel.", "Energy", "Trump has said he will approve the Keystone oil pipeline and grant more oil drilling permits leading to lower energy costs and providing thousands of jobs. Lower energy costs help everybody, but the poor most of all. Clinton, by contrast, will make fracking nearly impossible and essentially abolish the coal industry, causing energy prices to skyrocket.", "Executive orders and bathrooms", "Trump has promised to rescind many of the most objectionable executive orders given by President Obama, so he will likely end the compulsory moral degradation forced on us by a liberal agenda, including orders forcing schools to allow boys in girls\u2019 bathrooms and locker rooms, in defiance of the will of the vast majority of Americans. But Hillary Clinton would likely perpetuate and expand these policies.", "Health care", "Trump will work to repeal Obamacare, which is ruining the nation\u2019s health care system, and replace it with an affordable free market system in which companies have the ability to sell insurance across state lines, thus substantially lowering insurance prices especially in those states that currently allow only high-priced \"Cadillac\" insurance plans. But Clinton would continue to work relentlessly toward federal government control of our entire health care industry.", "The unprotected", "Trump will finally begin to recognize and protect what Wall Street Journal writer Peggy Noonan calls \"the unprotected\" in America -- people in lower income areas who cannot find good jobs, cannot find good schools for their children, do not feel protected from crime, and find their retirement savings are not enough because for years they have been earning no interest in the bank. Trump said in his acceptance speech, \"Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across the nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned . . . I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves.\"", "These American citizens recognize that Trump has built a business career on listening to experts, solving problems, and getting things done. They realize that Trump didn\u2019t earn $4 billion by being stupid, and their instinct says that he might be exactly the right person to solve some of the biggest problems in a nation that has for too long been headed in the wrong direction and stuck in political gridlock.", "They may not have college degrees but their old-fashioned common sense tells them that America would be a much better place if we no longer had to be afraid to say \"Merry Christmas,\" or that boys are different from girls, or that Islamic terrorists are Islamic terrorists. They\u2019re sick and tired of being condescended to by the snobbish moralism of the liberal elites who dominate the power centers in our nation. That is why they cheer when Trump repeatedly violates the canons of politically correct speech. They have found in him someone who gives them hope, and they are supporting him by the thousands.", "Does character matter?", "\"But are you saying that character doesn\u2019t matter?\" someone might ask. I believe that character does matter, but I think Trump\u2019s character is far better than what is portrayed by much current political mud-slinging, and far better than his opponent\u2019s character.", "In addition, if someone makes doubts about character the only factor to consider, that is a fallacy in ethical reasoning that I call \"reductionism\" \u2013 the mistake of reducing every argument to only one factor, when the situation requires that multiple factors be considered. In this election, an even larger factor is the future of the nation that would flow from a Clinton or a Trump presidency.", "To my friends who tell me they won\u2019t vote for Trump because there is a chance he won\u2019t govern at all like he promises, I reply that all of American presidential history shows that that result is unlikely, and it is ethically fallacious reasoning to base a decision on assuming a result that is unlikely to happen.", "Consider instead the most likely results. The most likely result of voting for Trump is that he will govern the way he promises to do, bringing much good to the nation.", "But the most likely result of not voting for Trump is that you will be abandoning thousands of unborn babies who will be put to death under Hillary Clinton\u2019s Supreme Court, thousands of Christians who will be excluded from their lifelong occupations, thousands of the poor who will never again be able to find high-paying jobs in an economy crushed by government hostility toward business, thousands of inner-city children who will never be able to get a good education, thousands of the sick and elderly who will never get adequate medical treatment when the government is the nation\u2019s only healthcare provider, thousands of people who will be killed by an unchecked ISIS, and millions of Jews in Israel who will find themselves alone and surrounded by hostile enemies. And you will be contributing to a permanent loss of the American system of government due to a final victory of unaccountable judicial tyranny.", "When I look at it this way, my conscience, and my considered moral judgment tell me that I must vote for Donald Trump as the candidate who is most likely to do the most good for the United States of America."], "targetTitle": "Why Voting for Donald Trump Is a Morally Good Choice", "targetDescription": "Some of my Christian friends tell me they cant in good conscience vote for Donald Trump because, when faced with a choice between the lesser of two evils, the morally right thing is to choose neither one.

According to a recent study at the University of Chicago, sleep deprivation is also the cause of an increase in the appetite for salty and sweet treats. The results are quite substantial, going into the link between obesity and sleep deprivation.", "Just by depriving oneself of sleep, one can experience an increase in appetite a lot like the one experienced after getting stoned. The results even suggest that it may be a reaction of the body that causes the hunger boost much like getting the munchies after a joint.", "Conducting the study", "The University of Chicago invited 14 men and women in their twenties to come and participate in two sessions at the clinical research centre there at the university. The researchers controlled the sleep patterns of the participants, meaning that sometimes they slept 7 hours and at other times their sleep was reduced down to only 4 hours and 11 minutes. The researchers also controlled how much food and what food was being served to the participants, serving them three meals a day at 9 am, 2 pm and 7 pm.", "After the fourth night of each session, the participants were offered snacks from which to choose. They included the kind of snacks we like to indulge in when we are stoned, such as extremely sweet or salty food.

Depriving the human body of sleep interfere\u2019s with its production of hormones that control things like appetite and satiety.", "The scientists conducting this study looked into the kind of hormones that were present in the blood during the study. They looked specifically at the hormones ghrelin and leptin. Ghrelin is the hormone that deals with appetite whereas leptin is the hormone that tells the brain when the body is full of food.", "The endocannabinoid system", "Finally, the scientists decided that they would delve a little further into the body\u2019s craving for food and have a look at the endocannabinoid system, the same system that is excited and activated by using marijuana. Erin Hanlon, who lead the study, found that there was a certain endocannabinoid that was increased after sleep deprivation that could be the cause for the increase in appetite.", "Endocannabinoid 2-AG is the chemical that increases the amount of pleasure you feel after you eat, and is an endocannabinoid that also increases after the use of marijuana. \"We know that marijuana activates the endocannabinoid system and causes people to overeat when they are not hungry, and they normally eat yummy sweet and fatty foods,\" Hanlon said. \"Sleep restriction may cause overeating by acting in the same manner.\"", "So it seems that sleep deprivation has a very similar effect on the body in terms of appetite as using marijuana does.

John Edgar Browning of Georgia Tech, who has researched the practice, suggests in a BBC article that thousands of people across the United States drink blood for various reasons. Some of these people say the oxygen- and iron-enriched substance gives them energy, and none of the drinkers interviewed by Browning have had any ill effects from their behavior, so perhaps they didn't overdo the blood meals: \"No vampire I\u2019ve interviewed has complained of any medical complications as a result of consuming blood,\" Browning said, according to BBC.", "Unlike humans, the bodies of animals that digest blood have adapted specialized digestive mechanisms. According to Katherine Ramsland in her book \"The Science of Vampires\" (Penguin Putnam, 2002) the vampire bat, \"requires an enormous intake of iron, which helps make hemoglobin for carrying oxygen from the lungs to the body tissues. Yet the iron intake is generally higher than what the bat needs, so it has a special process for secreting the excess. When ingested, the blood goes through a tract that's adapted for extracting nutrients. Research on this system suggests that bats have a mucous membrane along the intestinal tract that acts as a barrier to prevent too much iron from getting into their bloodstreams.\"", "You, however, are not a vampire bat.

Neither had I. Yet it strikes many older Americans, usually in their 70s and 80s, more women than men. The afflicted are more often of Northern European extraction, indicating to researchers that genetics may be at work.", "Fortunately, PMR responds quickly to the steroid drug prednisone. The important thing is to recognize, not ignore, the symptoms and seek help. I felt better within a day of finally seeing my doctor, being diagnosed and taking my first dose of prednisone. In most cases, the condition can be cured, although slowly over months, sometimes years. And in some situations it can be complicated by a more serious disease.", "Why and how PMR strikes is mysterious, although researchers are looking at viruses or stress as triggers for the disease. But undeniably, it is associated with aging, and particularly the aging immune system.", "With the first wave of baby boomers heading into their 70s this year, America\u2019s elderly population will swell, and doctors think there will almost certainly be more cases of PMR.", "Basically, polymyalgia rheumatica tricks the immune system into attacking its own body \u2014 sending antibodies and immune cells into the hundreds of fluid-filled sacs called bursae that lie throughout our joints and surrounding soft tissue. In the healthy body, those sacs \u2014 some no wider than a dime, others the size of a silver dollar \u2014 keep our joints moving smoothly. But when inflamed by PMR, they cause pain and stiffness. PMR also impedes the bone marrow\u2019s ability to make red blood cells, causing anemia.", "Such an inflammatory response is like a complex cascade, according to Marcy O\u2019Koon Moss, director of consumer health for the Arthritis Foundation, which counts PMR among more than 100 diseases it focuses on.", "\"It\u2019s not one thing that happens. The cells involved signal each other and communicate,\" she said.", "Many people stricken with PMR confuse their symptoms with aging and just soldier on. But as the disease progresses and becomes more debilitating, most figure that something beyond old age is at work.", "Phil Ringo, 74, of Haverford, Pa., couldn\u2019t imagine what was wrong four years ago when he began feeling sore and ill.", "\"I thought I\u2019d gone from a pretty vigorous 70-year-old to an old, old man,\" he said. \"Grandchildren were saying, \u2018What\u2019s wrong with Papa?\u2019 \"", "Unable to get out of a chair or into a cab without a struggle, he got no answers from his doctors. And when he tried for an appointment with one of the nation\u2019s top diagnostic clinics, \"they basically said, \u2018You\u2019re an old guy.\u2019 \" Ringo said. \" \u2018 Just get used to it.\u2019 \" He was finally diagnosed and treated after a friend with the disease convinced him to see a rheumatologist.", "Actually PMR is famously tricky to diagnose.", "\"A definitive test does not exist for PMR,\" said rheumatologist Rebecca Manno, a Johns Hopkins School of Medicine faculty member and researcher. \"And there are other conditions that mimic PMR,\" such as rheumatoid arthritis, various infections and even some forms of cancer.", "So the diagnostic process can be torturous. Leslie Kermath, 70, of Whitefish, Mont., spent almost a month undergoing tests before her doctor felt confident that PMR was causing her pain, stiffness and fever.", "Along the way, she got antibiotics for an existing urinary tract infection, was sent to the hospital for a chest X-ray and a CAT scan after a test flagged a possible blood clot. Later she had another CAT scan of her abdomen and pelvis, because her hips were terribly painful. A Lyme disease test came back negative.", "Eventually, her blood tests, which showed increasing levels of inflammation, plus her symptoms and age, nailed the diagnosis for Kermath\u2019s doctor, who started her on prednisone.", "\"How many women of Caucasian origin, who are older, think they\u2019re just aging and can\u2019t do everything they used to \u2014 when they actually have this disease?\" said Kermath, who is an avid hiker.", "Most doctors suspecting PMR order several blood tests, almost always two that look for inflammation: the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, known as the ESR test, and another for CRP, or C-reactive protein. Doctors also check for antibodies associated with rheumatoid arthritis, to rule out that disease.", "When I finally dragged myself to my internist three months after my symptoms showed up, she immediately suspected PMR. Given my age \u2014 73 \u2014 my symptoms and lab results showing considerable inflammation and anemia, she started me on prednisone and sent me to a rheumatologist. After eight weeks of prednisone, my inflammation numbers had fallen to near normal and my anemia was under control.", "My rheumatologist has reduced my steroid dose, but only very gradually because rebounds do happen. The hope is that I can be steroid-free \u2014 a sign of a cure \u2014 sometime in 2017.", "\"Treating PMR is one of the more gratifying parts of my practice,\" said my doctor, Joseph P. Laukaitis. \"In my experience, about 95 percent of patients fully recover.\"", "For a PMR patient, prednisone feels like a miracle drug because it so quickly attacks inflammation and banishes the pain and stiffness. But in fact, prednisone is \"wonderful, wicked\" in Manno\u2019s words. The side effects that some people experience are considerable: a thinning of the bones (already a problem for many older women), high blood pressure, weight gain, high blood sugar, insomnia and a distinctive addition of facial fat known as \"moon face.\"", "Most patients who take prednisone for PMR will also be prescribed a drug to slow bone loss, and that medication, too, has side effects.", "Although diagnosing PMR can be difficult, doing so is crucial because a much more serious disease, giant cell arteritis, strikes about 10 to 20 percent of people with PMR. Giant cell arteritis causes inflammation and damage to blood vessels in the head and elsewhere. Untreated, it can cause blindness, stroke, even death. PMR patients can expect their doctors to look for symptoms of GCA: severe headaches, tender scalp, jaw pain and blurred vision.", "Any one of those can indicate that the arteries of the head are inflamed. The diagnosis often requires a biopsy of one of the arteries in the scalp to confirm inflammation. Again, prednisone is the treatment.", "Much of today\u2019s research into PMR and GCA looks for alternatives to prednisone.", "Biologics \u2014 drugs made from living organisms \u2014 hold promise because some can \"inhibit an inflammatory response as it picks up steam,\" the Arthritis Foundation\u2019s O\u2019Koon Moss said. \"It\u2019s like interrupting a chain reaction.\"", "\"There are also promising clinical trials of drugs that treat rheumatoid arthritis and have FDA approval for that. And they may be effective for PMR,\" Manno said.", "Until other drugs become available, prednisone will remain the preferred treatment despite all its of downsides.", "As I face months of treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica, taking smaller and smaller doses of prednisone each month, I hope to avoid remission and eventually regain my strength. Exercise is key, as it so often is when ill health strikes, so you\u2019ll find me on the stationary bike or walking or, if not rowing, at least beginning to build up stamina on the indoor rowing machine.", "The rowing season of 2016 may have eluded me, but the 2017 season is only months away."], "targetTitle": "I\u2019d never heard of this condition until the terrible joint pain set in", "targetDescription": "Don\u2019t delay going to the doctor, because treatment can make you feel better fast.", "targetKeywords": "joint pain, pmr, polymyalgia rheumatica, prednisone, aging joints, pain management, cortisone shot, immune system", "targetMedia": null, "targetUrl": null, "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": null, "spoilerPublisher": null}, "spoiler": ["polymyalgia rheumatica"], "spoilerPositions": [[[3, 13], [3, 35]]], "tags": ["phrase"], "predicted_labels": 1}

With that victory \u2014 yes, the following words are really true \u2014 the Chicago Cubs won the World Series.", "But it just couldn\u2019t come easy, couldn\u2019t be won without extra drama. The Cubs carried a 6-3 lead into the eighth inning, six outs away from a cathartic victory. But a double and a two-run home run by the Indians wiped out that lead and tied the game, and the deadlock held through the ninth inning.", "Then the rain came. Of course. The top of the 10th inning was delayed for about 15 minutes by a deluge. But once it let up, the Cubs poured it on in the 10th inning, scoring 2 runs to provide the cushion they needed. World Series M.V.P. Ben Zobrist hit a go-ahead double, and Miguel Montero followed up with an R.B.I. single to give the Cubs the insurance run they needed.", "It is their third title in the World Series, a competition that was introduced in 1903, but this may be the sweetest and hardest-earned championship in the history of American sports. Making it even more sweet was that the Cubs trailed in the series by three games to one.", "Upon the final out the players jumped and celebrated on the diamond while thousands of visiting Cubs fans screamed joyfully in the stands. Back in Chicago, where fans in the North Side of Chicago have waited generations for this day, revelers poured into the streets for party that will probably last days.", "In Cleveland, a city with its own hard-luck sports history, the wait continues. The Indians have not won the World Series since 1948, and they now own the longest drought in baseball without a title. At least the Cleveland Cavaliers, many of whom were in attendance Wednesday at Progressive Field, broke Cleveland\u2019s 52-year span without a major professional sports title by winning the N.B.A. championship in June.", "For the Cubs, whose long history is riddled with the mythology of billy goat curses, black cats and a fan who was vilified for interfering with a foul ball, theirs is now a history of winning, and their identity changes forever.", "Theo Epstein knows all about that. He is the Cubs\u2019 top baseball decision-maker, the man who put together a team and an ethos capable of dashing history\u2019s long reach.", "Prior to joining the Cubs, Epstein was the general manager of the Boston Red Sox in 2004, when that once-accursed franchise won its first World Series in 86 years. Red Sox and Cubs fans were the longest suffering at the time, and Epstein has given closure to both.", "Here\u2019s an inning-by-inning breakdown of how the Cubs won Game 7:", "Top of 1st: Fowler Crushes One", "Corey Kluber is trying to become the first pitcher to win three starts in a single World Series since 1968, but he got off to a terrible start when Dexter Fowler launched the fourth pitch of the game over the center field wall, giving the Cubs a 1-0 lead and quieting the Indians fans at Cleveland\u2019s Progressive Field. It was the first leadoff home run ever in Game 7 of a World Series.", "After Fowler\u2019s blast, Kyle Schwarber hit a slow grounder to the right side of the infield. The Indians had the shift on, and Francisco Lindor, the shortstop, was able to field the ball, but Schwarber, running on a reconstructed knee, was able to beat the throw for an infield single.", "Kris Bryant flied out to right for the first out of the game, and Anthony Rizzo followed him by flying out to center. Schwarber, who has three career stolen bases, surprised the Indians (and just about anyone watching) by stealing second with Ben Zobrist at the plate, but Kluber was able to get Zobrist to pop out to end the inning.", "Kluber escaped having allowed just one run and kept his pitch count to 19, but it was hardly the start he was looking for.", "David Waldstein: When Fowler hit that home run, I almost thought for a moment that Rajai Davis caught the ball on his jump because it seemed like the entire stadium erupted. But it was Cubs fans celebrating the home run. I have never seen this many visiting fans invade a baseball stadium for such a big game. Yes, you will see a lot of Yankees fans in Tampa in May, but this is Game 7 of the World Series. If it is not 50-50 between Cubs and Indians fans, then it is 40-60. In the section of the bleachers closest to center field, it appeared to be 80 percent Cubs fans.", "Bottom of 1st: Indians Can\u2019t Match Cubs\u2019 Start", "The Indians were not able to match the Cubs\u2019 strong start to the game.", "Leadoff man Carlos Santana crushed a liner to right on Kyle Hendricks\u2019s first pitch, but it was right at Jason Heyward, who easily caught the ball for the first out. Jason Kipnis followed him and flailed meekly at a low changeup for strike three. Francisco Lindor then hit a grounder to second that appeared to be an easy out, but Javier Baez slipped when trying to throw from his knees, which allowed Lindor to reach safely. Hendricks was able to work around the error by inducing a broken-bat grounder to shortstop from Mike Napoli to end the inning.", "Victor Mather: Hendricks last pitched in Game 3, when he threw 4 1/3 somewhat shaky innings, giving up six hits and two walks. But crucially, like the first inning tonight, he gave up no runs.", "David Waldstein: Terry Francona was on a pregame humor jag, making jokes about how he had a dream after Game 6 that someone was breaking his ribs. He woke up to discover he had been sleeping on the TV remote and it was stuck in his ribcage. He also admitted he was dipping pretzels in peanut butter in bed and when he woke up there was peanut butter on his glasses. \"My bedroom looked like a national disaster last night,\" he said. Too much info?", "Top of 2nd: Kluber Settles In", "Kluber got through the inning in an efficient seven pitches. Addison Russell was the offensive star of Game 6 with a two-run double and a grand slam, but Corey Kluber was able to retire him in his first at-bat tonight on a towering popup to shortstop. Willson Contreras then hit a pitch into right-field foul territory that Lonnie Chisenhall tracked down with little effort. Jason Heyward shattered his bat popping out to shortstop.", "David Waldstein: Kluber settles down to retire the last six batters, all on fly balls. Kluber is 12-1 in his last 14 starts at Progressive Field with a 1.87 earned run average, including postseason games. But this is the only time he has started three times in nine days. Now it\u2019s up the the Indians hitters to get him back even.", "Bottom of 2nd: Hendricks Helps Himself", "The Indians had runners reach base twice in the half-inning but got nothing to show for it.", "Jose Ramirez led off with a grounder that caromed off of Kyle Hendricks before rolling toward shortstop. With the ball coming at him fairly slowly, Addison Russell tried to barehand it but came up without the ball as Ramirez reached first. The play was ruled a single rather than an error, as Russell likely did not have a play. Ramirez, however, underestimated Hendricks\u2019 ability to hold on runners and got picked off of first.", "Lonnie Chisenhall singled, but Rajai Davis grounded into a 5-4-3 double play that was truly impressive considering Davis\u2019s speed.", "David Waldstein: Great play by the icy-veined Kyle Hendricks to pick off Jose Ramirez off first. But everyone knows Hendricks has a terrific pickoff move, so it is kind of unforgivable to get caught. That really messed up the inning because Chisenhall\u2019s single would have put two runners on base with nobody out.", "The Indians were very sloppy in Game 6 and cannot afford to do that again, especially with the Cubs\u2019 batters getting warmed up in this weather.", "Top of 3rd: Schwarber Runs Cubs Out of Inning", "Javier Baez put a big swing on a 1-1 curveball but just missed as he flied out to left for the first out of the inning. Dexter Fowler, he of the leadoff home run, then jumped on the first pitch he saw from Corey Kluber in his second at-bat, but lined out to right. With two outs, Kyle Schwarber swung into the shift and punched the ball through the crowded right side of the infield. But Schwarber got greedy and tried to stretch the hit into a double and was thrown out easily at second base by Lonnie Chisenhall to end the inning.", "Victor Mather: Maybe you aren\u2019t a baseball fan. Well, Akron and Toledo are involved in some exciting college football MACtion on ESPN2. As you might expect, with an Indians World Series on the line, the crowd is sparse in Akron.", "David Waldstein: Lonnie Chisenhall has had an adventurous World Series, but he has a great arm and Schwarber never should have challenged it, especially with a surgically repaired knee. The shenanigans in the outfield in Game 6 were mostly miscommunication and the fault of the center fielder, Tyler Naquin, and that is why he is on the bench.", "Bottom of 3rd: Indians Get Aggressive", "The Indians tied the game thanks to a leadoff double, a well-placed bunt, and a run-scoring single. It looked like it could get far worse for the Cubs, but Kyle Hendricks once again worked his way around a few baserunners.", "Coco Crisp got things started by showing some serious aggressiveness, lacing a ball into the left field corner and legging out a leadoff double. Hoping to take advantage of the baserunner by playing some small ball, the Indians had Roberto Perez bunt Crisp over to third. Carlos Santana then crushed a 1-0 curveball to right for a single, bringing Crisp home and tying the game.", "With one run in, Jason Kipnis hit what looked like a double-play ball to shortstop. Addison Russell flipped to Javier Baez who dropped the ball, and all runners were ruled safe after a review of the play.", "The defensive miscue set Cleveland up with runners on first and second with one out. But Francisco Lindor flied out to left and Mike Napoli lined out to third to end the threat.", "Victor Mather: It\u2019s been a tough Series for Napoli, who was 4-for-19 without an extra-base hit coming into this game, is 0 for 2 tonight and just missed his chance with men on first and second and two outs. It was a great advertisement for replay when the terrible out call on Santana at second was overturned. Baez never had it.", "David Waldstein: The Indians are squaring up on Hendricks, so Cubs Manager Joe Maddon instructed Jon Lester to start warming up.", "It was so important for the Indians to get back even, which is why they played for the one run. Some may have wanted the Indians to play for the big inning since they seemed to be on Hendricks, but Francona elected to draw even. Roberto Perez did a terrific job of executing the bunt with Rizzo only about 20 feet away from him. The Cubs, particularly Baez, are looking shaky.", "Top of 4th: Cubs Back on Top", "A shallow pop-fly to center and some aggressive baserunning by Kris Bryant put the Cubs back in the lead. Willson Contreras tacked on an R.B.I. double and with a 3-1 lead, Chicago had some breathing room for the first time this game.", "Bryant led off the inning by working a full-count against Corey Kluber, and on the eighth pitch of the at-bat he singled on a hard grounder to left. Anthony Rizzo was hit in the right shoulder by a pitch, bringing up Ben Zobrist with two runners on and no outs. He hit a grounder to first that Mike Napoli fielded and threw to Francisco Lindor who was covering second. Rizzo slid in under Lindor\u2019s feet, but was ruled out even though Lindor\u2019s foot may not have been on the bag.", "That brought up Addison Russell with runners at the corners and he hit a shallow pop-up to center. Bryant, knowing that Rajai Davis does not have a strong throwing arm, broke for home as Davis caught the ball and he slid in just ahead of the tag from Roberto Perez.", "Kluber looked like he had Contreras on the ropes with two outs, but the young catcher launched a 2-2 curveball into deep center that got over Davis\u2019s head. Zobrist scored and Contreras got into second base easily. Kluber ended the bleeding by retiring Jason Heyward on a pop-out to shortstop.", "David Waldstein: Now the Indians are making the miscues. The Cubs scored twice, but it could have been and maybe should have been zero. The Believelanders are feeling like Bereavelanders.", "Victor Mather: Wilson Contreras, 1-for-17 coming into tonight, has probably been the Cubs\u2019 worst Series performer. But he comes through to give the Cubs the 3-1 lead. His rookie season was a key part of the Cubs\u2019 fine year; now he adds a big World Series R.B.I.", "Bottom of 4th: Hendricks Works Well With a Lead", "Kyle Hendricks undoubtedly has an incredibly short leash from Joe Maddon, but he started things off well in the half-inning by retiring Jose Ramirez on a soft grounder to first base. He retired Lonnie Chisenhall on a soft fly to left for the second out, and got Rajai Davis to fly to right to end the inning. Hendricks has thrown just 50 pitches, but it would be surprising if he stayed in the game beyond the fifth inning.", "David Waldstein: That was a great inning by Hendricks. One of the most important things in pitching is the shutdown inning after your team scores. Hendricks had his cleanest frame of the game and that was vital in terms of solidifying the lead and demoralizing the Indians. The tension and the excitement that was felt in this stadium just an inning ago has changed perceptibly. Now it feels just a tiny bit more like a sense of inevitability. The Cubs seem to be rolling ever since Game 5. Still a ways to go, though. The meat of the Indians\u2019 order comes up at least two more times.", "Top of 5th: Baez Ends Kluber\u2019s Night", "The Cubs extended their lead to four the hard way, by getting one apiece off of Corey Kluber and Andrew Miller.", "Javier Baez took a hard cut at Kluber\u2019s first pitch of the inning and crushed a home run, ending the ace\u2019s night. Terry Francona immediately headed to the mound to replace him with Miller and start what could be a long night for the Indians\u2019 bullpen.", "Dexter Fowler was the first batter to face Miller and was not intimidated by the reliever, stroking a 1-2 slider into left for a single. But Kyle Schwarber gave Miller some help by grounding into a 6-4-3 double-play.", "Kris Bryant came up with two outs and worked a full-count off of Miller. He somehow ended up drawing a walk on the ninth pitch of the at-bat, after seeing Miller\u2019s \"unhittable\" slider on six consecutive pitches, and then was running on the pitch when Anthony Rizzo sliced a single to right. Bryant, running hard the entire way, was able to score and Rizzo reached second after the throw.", "It looked like Chicago could do even more damage when Ben Zobrist hit a ball to deep center field, but Rajai Davis caught it on the warning track to end the inning. Miller, who the Indians would like to soak up at least a few innings, has already thrown 20 pitches.", "David Waldstein: The Cubs are really swinging well now in the warm weather, much like they did in the regular season when they scored 808 runs, the most by a National League team at sea level (Red Sox had 878 runs, the Rockies 845). Perhaps it was only a matter of time, perhaps it was fatigue among the Indians\u2019 pitchers, perhaps it was the addition of Schwarber lengthening the lineup. Even Baez, who was 4 for 26 with 4 singles (and 2 errors in Game 7) hit a home run off the previously impenetrable Kluber. They are even hitting Andrew Miller hard.", "Victor Mather: If this were the last time the Cubs won the World Series, the game would be over. The decisive Game 5 of that Series, in 1908, lasted 1 hour, 25 minutes. No game in the series lasted more than 2:10.", "Bottom of 5th: Lester and Ross Open Door for Indians", "The move to bring in Jon Lester as a reliever had major implications for the Cubs, mostly because of the corresponding move to put in his personal catcher, David Ross. Because of two miscues by Ross, the Indians scored two runs, cutting Chicago\u2019s lead in half.", "Kyle Hendricks was allowed to come out to start the inning even though Jon Lester was ready in Chicago\u2019s bullpen. He got a soft grounder to second from Coco Crisp for the first out, and struck out Roberto Perez for out two. But Hendricks walked Carlos Santana and his day was done, with Lester being summoned to face Jason Kipnis.", "Kipnis hit a soft grounder that was fielded by Ross, but the veteran who had just entered the game, threw the ball well out of Anthony Rizzo\u2019s reach, which resulted in Francisco Lindor coming up with runners on second and third with two outs. Lester threw a ball in the dirt that caromed off of Ross\u2019s mask and as the catcher tried to go after it, he stumbled, taking so long to recover the ball that both runners scored.", "Lester was able to strike out Lindor to end the inning, but the game certainly got more interesting.", "Because Hendricks did not pitch five innings, he is not in line for the victory should the Cubs hold on.", "David Waldstein: Lester (and to a lesser degree, Ross) coming into the game was supposed to be the Cubs\u2019 Madison Bumgarner moment, but it looked more like an old-fashioned Cubs moment. Terrific, aggressive base running by Jason Kipnis to score from second base on a wild pitch. He never hesitated and made a beautiful slide under the tag, then got up and punched the air. Terrible inning by Ross, who made the error to allow Kipnis to get all the way to second, and then was staggered by the ball when the wild pitch hit him in the mask. It feels like a game again.", "Top of 6th: Ross Makes Up for Mistakes", "David Ross helped erase some of the damage his defense had done in the previous inning by launching a one-out home run to center field that pushed Chicago\u2019s lead back to 6-3. Jason Heyward was the second out of the inning when he grounded out to first, and Javier Baez struck out to end the inning.", "Andrew Miller, who looked unhittable earlier in the playoffs, has now allowed two earned runs and gotten just four outs.", "David Waldstein: I promise, were not making all this up. David Ross, who is playing in his last professional baseball game at age 39, who has played on 21 different professional teams at all levels, who is the elder statesman of the Cubs, just hit his first World Series home run. It came after a wild inning behind the plate where he made one error, then got punched in the mask by a bouncing wild pitch that allowed two runs to score. Is it meant to be?", "Bottom of 6th: Indians Come Up Short", "Mike Napoli continued his struggles by striking out to lead off the half-inning. That brought up Jose Ramirez, and the third baseman grounded out to shortstop, nearly beating Addison Russell\u2019s throw to first base that Anthony Rizzo made a great stretch on. Brandon Guyer came in as a pinch-hitter for Lonnie Chisenhall and he hit a two-out single to left, but Rajai Davis grounded out to strand him at first.", "Victor Mather: Oct. 14, 1908. Bennett Park, Detroit. Orval Overall outdueled Wild Bill Donovan, and the Cubs won the World Series. They are nine outs away from doing it again.", "Top of 7th: Cubs Chase Miller, but Fail to Score", "Dexter Fowler improved to 3 for 4 by singling to start the inning. That brought Kyle Schwarber to the plate in a tough lefty-on-lefty matchup against Andrew Miller and the ace reliever won the battle, getting Schwarber to fly out to left.", "But with that that, Miller\u2019s day was over, with Terry Francona replacing him with the team\u2019s closer, Cody Allen. Allen was able to strand the runner he inherited from Miller by striking out Kris Bryant, as Fowler was caught stealing after the pitch for a double play.", "While Miller is not on the hook for a loss, the game was well below his standards. He threw 43 pitches in two and one-third innings, allowing four hits and two earned runs.", "Bottom of 7th: Lester Gets Job Done", "Coco Crisp flied out to left to start the inning and then Jon Lester ran the count full against Roberto Perez before walking the catcher on the seventh pitch of the at-bat. Tyler Naquin came in as a pinch-runner for Perez before Carlos Santana hit a come-backer to Lester. The yips that have been a topic of conversation throughout the playoffs were in play as Lester barely looked at second before throwing underhand to first to get one out on a play that would have gotten two with almost any other pitcher on the mound. Lester did not end up paying for it as he struck out Jason Kipnis to end the inning.", "Top of 8th: Allen Shuts Down Cubs", "A dropped strike three forced a throw to first base, but Anthony Rizzo was easily retired to start the inning. Then Ben Zobrist looked completely overwhelmed by Cody Allen\u2019s stuff before eventually grounding out to first. Addison Russell watched strikes one and two sail right past him before popping out to first base to end the inning. Allen has need just 17 pitches to record five outs.", "Bottom of 8th: Tie Game!", "A day after he was controversially brought into a blowout rather than being preserved for a Game 7 appearance, Aroldis Chapman proved to be human by giving up Chicago\u2019s three-run lead in just two batters.", "Jon Lester had gotten the first two outs of the inning but was pulled from the game after Jose Ramirez hit a ball up the middle that Addison Russell couldn\u2019t quite handle.", "Brought in for a four-out save, Chapman fired seven consecutive fastballs to Brandon Guyer, topping out at 100.3 miles per hour, but it was the last one that cost him as Guyer drove the ball to left\u2013center for a double, bringing in a run. Chapman then imploded, allowing a two-run home run to Rajai Davis that tied the game and blew the save attempt. Coco Crisp piled on with a single but Yan Gomes, who had entered the game in the eighth inning, struck out to end the inning.", "Chapman ended up throwing 21 pitches and looked like he was completely out of gas despite the radar gun indicating he still had his velocity.", "Top of 9th: Cubs\u2019 Squeeze Doesn\u2019t Work", "With new life breathed into the Cleveland Indians, and rain starting to fall, Cody Allen walked the leadoff batter, David Ross, on five pitches. The Cubs looked to capitalize by bringing in Chris Coghlan as a pinch-runner for Ross, but he was erased on a force-out when Jason Heyward grounded to second base. Heyward then got something started by stealing his third base of the series, and advanced to third on a bad throw from Yan Gomes.", "Michael Martinez was brought in as a defensive replacement in right field to help prevent a sacrifice fly from scoring a run, but Shaw took care of Javier Baez by striking him out on an awkward two-strike bunt attempt. That brought up Dexter Fowler, who had been one of the Cubs\u2019 better hitters all game, and he laced a ball up the middle that looked like it would get through before Francisco Lindor chased it down behind second base and threw Fowler out at first.", "The Indians now have a chance to win the game and the series at home in the bottom of the ninth.", "Bottom of 9th: Chapman Shuts Down Indians in 9th", "This game is headed to extra innings.", "Aroldis Chapman was back out to start the bottom of the ninth despite having looked completely worn out in the eighth. He got Carlos Santana to fly out before ending up in a long battle with Jason Kipnis.

Detached from her lethally curvaceous figure, the actress' breathy contralto is no less seductive, but it also alights with tenderness and wonder as Samantha, both here on Earth and up there in the Cloud, voraciously devours literature, philosophy and human experience,\" wrote Variety critic Scott Foundas.", "\"Johansson's work in the film is lovely, and the best thing about the way she plays the part is that there's nothing calculated or 'sexy' about the way she approaches it. Removed from the undeniable sweater-girl appeal she packs when she's onscreen, forced to rely only on her voice, Johansson comes across as a warm, curious, vibrant personality. It's incredibly appealing,\" echoed HitFix critic Drew McWeeny. (HuffPost Entertainment was in the tank for Johansson as well.)", "With regard to Johansson's Oscar bona fides, the issue becomes slightly tricky. As Deadline.com's Pete Hammond pointed out, non-traditional \"flesh-and-blood\" acting roles -- like Andy Serkis, who did revolutionary motion-capture work as Gollum in the \"Lord of the Rings\" films -- are normally ignored by Academy Awards voters. Johansson's performance appears somewhat different, however, as she's not helped by any technical tricks or animation.", "For what it's worth, Warner Bros. and \"Her\" producer Megan Ellison are planning a full-court press for Johansson's awards campaign.

It is thought to have first occurred when humans began to migrate from Africa to Europe, meaning that every person with blue eyes is a descendent of a single early European.", "The fact that every blue-eyed person alive today has this same mutation is pretty compelling evidence for this theory, although the identity of the initial mutant remains something of a mystery.

What if I turned into a hideously ugly beast? These fears were further heightened when my original colorist wasn't available for the double-process. At the last minute, I was ushered into the warm and welcoming hands of the team over at Hairstory Studio in New York City \u2014 specifically colorist and mega-babe Roxie Darling Roxie put me at ease. \"It will change your life because you will be received so much differently,\" she says. \"People's eyes are naturally drawn to light, and naturally drawn away from darkness.\" Basically, I was about to become Daenerys Targaryen.

Now, scientists have gone and done something incredibly cool\u2014they figured out a new way to cook the grain that could cut its calories in half...or more.", "New research was presented at the 249th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society, and revealed that adding a teaspoon of coconut oil to boiling water with a half-cup of non-fortified white rice, letting it simmer for 20 to 40 minutes, then refrigerating it for 12 hours may reduce the number of calories your body takes in by 50 to 60 percent.", "Like I said: Seriously cool.", "The researchers explained that rice contains two kinds of starch\u2014one that is easily digestible, and one that's resistant. Our bodies don't have the enzymes needed to digest the resistant kind, which means it can't break down that starch and transform it into the sugar that typically gets absorbed into the bloodstream. If you have extra sugar in your bloodstream, that gets turned into fat, which we know is no good. In other words, the scientists wanted to find a way to get the rice to have more resistant starch, rather than digestible ones, to avoid that extra sugar in the body.", "This is where the coconut oil comes in. Adding it to the cooking process makes the starch granules resistant to the action of digestive enzymes, and then letting the rice cool for 12 hours pushes the process along. Translation: Same amount of rice, fewer calories into the body.", "Bonus: You don't have to eat the rice cold to get the desired effect. Reheating it the next day won't affect results, the researchers found.", "No word yet on whether it works on brown rice, or if other oils will do the same thing, but more testing will be done to figure all that good stuff out.

Judge grew up in Linden, California, about two hours from what was then Pac Bell Park.", "\"I was a Giants fan and that was the time he was putting up 70 homers a year,\" said Judge, who's now a 6-foot-7, 282-pound right fielder for the New York Yankees. \"That was pretty impressive to watch as a kid.\"", "On Wednesday, Judge will celebrate his 25th birthday by playing his first game in the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry. He will step to the plate as a rookie sensation; his six homers are tied for the second most in the American League.", "But it's not just about how many balls he has hit over the fence -- it's how far he has hit them. Judge is challenging the current champ, Giancarlo Stanton, as the king of the XXXL home run.", "Judge\u2019s 460-foot homer on Saturday in Pittsburgh was the third longest for a Yankee since ESPN started tracking distances in 2009. Only Alex Rodriguez's 477-foot homer in August 2015 and Juan Miranda's 469-foot shot in October 2009 traveled farther. In the past two seasons, Judge has three of the four longest Yankee homers. Only Chase Headley, with a 453-footer in July 2016, cracks the top four. Headley believes he got all of that one, but he said he and his teammates are eager to see what would happen if everything clicks in perfectly for Judge.", "\"We are all just waiting for that time where everything just syncs up and he gets every bit of it,\" Headley said. \"I want to see him do that. He is just a humongous human being that has out-of-this-world power. Five hundred fifty feet is not out of the question. If there is nothing in the way, he is hitting it 550.\"", "Starlin Castro, who is usually in the same batting practice group as Judge, has never been big on watching teammates or opponents take BP. He remembers being around Stanton in the Arizona Fall League in 2009 and taking a few glances, but besides that, Castro said he has never been much of a gawker -- until now.", "\"He is the first guy,\" Castro said. \"I\u2019m really happy we are in the same group. It is really motivating. It is really fun to watch. We feel like every swing he takes, something big is going to happen.\"", "Matt Holliday, on the other hand, has always studied standout teammates and opponents in BP as if there'd be an exam afterward. It's not just tape-measure specialists, but contact guys too. Holliday looks for any little ingredient he can add to his game, making the 37-year-old slugger as qualified as anyone to weigh in on Judge\u2019s power.", "\"We are all just waiting for that time where everything just syncs up and he gets every bit of it ...

If there is nothing in the way, he is hitting it 550.\"", "\"There aren\u2019t many guys that can hit the ball as far as him in batting practice, if any,\" Holliday said. \"Obviously, Stanton is the easy one that comes to mind that I\u2019ve played against. Barry Bonds, too.\"", "Holliday has seen Stanton do his damage only as an opponent, while he receives a daily dose of Judge. He said it might just be familiarity, but he would take Judge in a distance contest.", "Mark Teixeira, who just completed a 14-year career in which he swatted 409 homers, said he used to watch Nelson Cruz launch some balls in the Arlington heat when they were teammates in Texas. In 2013, Teixeira played with Stanton in the World Baseball Classic.", "\"Judge\u2019s power is right there with those two guys,\" said Teixeira, now an ESPN analyst.", "In 2016, Judge struck out in 42 of his 84 at-bats, a performance so bad it made the Yankees hesitant to hand him the right-field job in spring training, even with a full winter endorsement from team owner Hal Steinbrenner. In the final days, the Yankees finally gave Judge the nod over Aaron Hicks. Judge has struck out 17 times in 61 at-bats thus far.", "\"I knew it was going to take some time for him to get used to minor league pitching and big league pitching and really grow into his swing, because he is a big guy and he has to grow into his strike zone,\" Teixeira said. \"The smarter he has gotten about swinging at certain pitches and the more ready he is at the plate, he looks like he is so dangerous right now. He is exactly where you would hope he would be when I saw him a few years ago.\"", "It's early, but Judge has joined Stanton as a player you can\u2019t miss.

The students were then shown pictures of 35 common foods, presented in pairs, and asked to say which they considered more likely to produce addiction-like eating behaviors.", "Unsurprisingly, foods dense in fat and glycemic load (the amount of carbohydrate in a food multiplied by how swiftly it is converted to sugar) topped the scale. As the authors note, drinks with higher concentrations of alcohol are more addictive than their more diffuse counterparts. The finding is also consistent with animal studies, which highlight the role of dopamine, our brain's \"pleasure chemical\" that's often implicated in addiction. For instance, rats fed a diet consisting of highly processed foods showed changes to the brain's dopamine system that's also seen in response to illicit drugs.", "The respondents were segmented in order to explore how gender and body mass index (BMI) alter the difficulty to resist particular food components. Gender was not found to be relevant; people with high BMIs reported addictive-like attraction to more foods, although the correlation was not as strong as might be expected.", "Chocolate came up most often, followed by ice cream and french fries.", "However, the authors were not convinced they had solved the question of which food is the most craving-inducing.

Mounting evidence has linked an unhealthy gut microbiota with inflammatory bowel disease, allergies, neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic diseases including obesity and diabetes.", "This new study is one of the first to suggest that not getting enough sleep is one way of making our gut bacteria unhealthy, Cedernaes explained.

You can order it in multiple editions (including an audiobook recorded by Matt and me) at Amazon, Barnes & Noble, iBooks, Google Play, Kobo, or your favorite indie bookseller.", "We're very proud of the book, and can't wait for people to start reading, but if you still need a taste or two to push you over the buying edge, The Ringer ran an excerpt last week featuring part of our explanation for how the top 100 was chosen, along with our joint essay on Deadwood, while Matt's home base at Vulture this morning has the essay on our top-ranked show, The Simpsons(*).", "(*) Maybe my favorite section of the book \u2013 and the favorite of many of the early reviewers \u2013 is called The Great Debate, where Matt and I argue out what should get the top pick after we initially wound up with a five-way tie for first place.", "Included below is the essay I wrote about a little show called Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which finished in a tie for 25th place \u2013 alongside, appropriately enough, fellow classic high school dramas Freaks and Geeks and My So-Called Life \u2013 among our Pantheon of series, coming up just as soon as I get the mustard out...", "Buffy the Vampire Slayer (WB, 1997\u20132001; UPN, 2001\u20132003) Total score: 94", "TV show titles rarely bring viewers into the tent, but they can keep them out. If you want to give your charming blended-family comedy an ironic name like Trophy Wife, don\"t be surprised if your target demographic takes it literally and stays far away. (See also Terriers, Selfie, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...)", "Now, Buffy the Vampire Slayer ran seven seasons, was never in danger of cancellation at any point (it jumped networks after season 5 only because UPN was looking to steal a hit from its rival the WB), launched a long-running (and, eventually, very good) spin-off in Angel, was beloved by its fans, and helped define the identity of an entire TV network for the short but memorable existence of the WB. By any standard you want to measure, Buffy was a success.", "Except maybe this one: If you tell someone who\"s never watched it that a show called Buffy the Vampire Slayer is among the best TV dramas of all time, they will roll their eyes at you and change the subject to something less divisive, like immigration policy.", "Would a Buffy the Vampire Slayer by any other name have been a crossover hit rather than a cult classic, or won more awards, or simply have been an easier sell to non-fans? Certainly, you can imagine WB executives thinking that, which is why they briefly tried to get Joss Whedon to shorten the title to just Slayer.", "Whedon held firm, and not just because it might have created confusion between the show and the thrash band that brought the world songs like \"Reign in Blood\" and \"Mandatory Suicide.\" He knew that Buffy the Vampire Slayer was the perfect title for his series, because it captured the exact spirit of what he was planning to make.", "You could give it a more serious or distinguished title, but no matter the packaging, the show inside would be about a vapid teenage girl, Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), who discovered that her destiny was to protect humankind from vampires, demons, and other creatures of the underworld, and a show whose tone shifted rapidly between horror, melodrama, action, and pure comedy. The name tells you all of that, and suggests that if you\"re turned off by it, you\"re probably not going to like the series to which it\"s applied.", "It was a tonal balance that director Fran Rubel Kuzui didn\"t even bother attempting with the campy Buffy movie adapted from Whedon\"s first script. The show, though, would have room for many different emotions, all juggled expertly by Gellar, Anthony Stewart Head, Alyson Hannigan, and the rest of the cast. It was a series made cheaply even by the standards of TV\"s fifth-place network, but it almost never seemed ridiculous despite the primitive effects and awkward stunt-doubling for Gellar. If it wanted to make you laugh at a bit of witty banter (\"I laugh in the face of danger. Then I hide until it goes away.\"), it could. If it wanted its latest monster to creep you out, it found the most disturbing context possible. And if it wanted to make you cry, it was pointless to try fighting it.", "If anything, the exaggerated nature of the various undead villains only made the high school setting more effective, because what is adolescence if not a time when every problem gets blown wildly out of proportion?", "In the real world, a girl whose boyfriend started treating her badly after they finally have sex wouldn\"t need to worry that he had turned pure evil, as happened with Buffy and her vampire love interest Angel (David Boreanaz), but it might feel that way for a while. And a real teen boy going through the changes of puberty might occasionally imagine himself a monster, but laconic guitar player Oz (Seth Green) actually transformed into a werewolf every time the moon was full.", "Turning monsters into metaphors for teenage emotional turmoil was a clever gambit, and one that played particularly well during the show\"s three seasons set in high school. Buffy is (by our rankings, anyway) one of the best TV shows ever set in high school, but it wasn\"t entirely immune to the same problems that eventually beset all such shows when their characters head to college. Even so, those later seasons still had a knack for landing on the right parallel between the supernatural and the universal, like Buffy\"s little sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) literally being put on earth to cause her problems (which in this case involved the literal end of the world).", "(Those later years also offered some thrilling formal experiments, including \"Hush,\" an homage to silent horror movies, involving demons who rob people of the ability to speak or scream; \"The Body,\" a stripped-down outing where Buffy confronts the mundane reality of her mother\"s death from natural causes; and the musical episode \"Once More, with Feeling,\" where a curse forces everyone to express their feelings through song.)", "Back to that title. Whedon once suggested to the New York Times, \"If I made Buffy the Lesbian Separatist, a series of lectures on PBS on why there should be feminism, no one would be coming to the party, and it would be boring. The idea of changing culture is important to me, and it can only be done in a popular medium.\"", "Whedon didn\"t invent feminism in TV storytelling, or even the idea of cross-pollinating it with fantasy and sci-fi tropes. (For much of its run, Buffy overlapped with Xena: Warrior Princess.) But he created one of the finest examples of it, and wrapped it up in a wildly entertaining package that included a name that may have made some potential viewers roll their eyes, but that made enough of them smile and think this might just be a show for them.", "And it was."], "targetTitle": "TV (THE BOOK): Why \u2018Buffy the Vampire Slayer\u2019 was one of TV\u2019s best shows ever", "targetDescription": "In an excerpt from TV (THE BOOK), Alan Sepinwall writes about the greatness of Joss Whedon's \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" starring Sarah Michelle Gellar.", "targetKeywords": "sepinwall, buffy the vampire slayer, tv the book", "targetMedia": ["http://p.uproxxcdn.com/photo/106987/profile", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=722969591073270&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/bmw-feat-uproxx-1.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1", "https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=l68nb&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0", "http://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/hitfixharleyteasuicidesquad.jpgwp-content/uploads/2016/08/tv-the-book-buffy.jpg?quality=100&w=650&h=433", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/150964.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1", "http://dbg52463.moatads.com?a=5a7216d001e44d7f8e401aa5705d27f8", "http://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=l68nb&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0", "http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/ryan-murphy.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/nodapl-wells-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8430760&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/top-chef-feat-uproxx-2.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/weird-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/fastlane-header.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1", "http://p.uproxxcdn.com/content/default-avatar.jpg", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/tv-the-book-buffy.jpg?quality=100&w=650", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/starter-jacket-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-73t-O7FWprUTo.gif", "http://d5i9o0tpq9sa1.cloudfront.net?a=5a7216d001e44d7f8e401aa5705d27f8", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/jeff-sessions-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/alan-sepinwall.jpg?quality=100&w=48", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/carl-ichan-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/future-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/grohlsteen-feature.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/sharp-dressed-man-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/spice-girls-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/ice-ramp-feature.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/chef-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/netflix-theater-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/kevin-gates-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/sampha-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1"], "targetUrl": "http://m.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/tv-the-book-why-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-was-the-best-possible-name-for-that-show", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "because it was.", "spoilerPublisher": "savedyouaclick"}, "spoiler": ["a show whose tone shifted rapidly between horror, melodrama, action, and pure comedy.

These days, the hot dog enjoys an iconic status. The WHO (World Health Organization) recently issues a report that suggests all processed meals can cause cancer, including red meat. The hot dogs are made of pork, beef and chicken. Factories often use leftovers from cutting steaks and pork chops as well as edible slaughter by-products such as animal feet or head, fatty tissue and skins.During the process, these ingredients are mixed together, and additives such as sat, corn syrup, nitrates, large amount of salt and chemicals are added. Most of these added ingredients have been continuously linked to cancer. Nitrosamines have been linked to bladder cancer, colon cancer, stomach cancer and pancreatic cancer.Data from the American Institute for Cancer Research shows that people who consume a single corn dog daily have a 21% higher risk of developing colorectal cancer. Even the organic hot dogs contain nitrites in even higher amounts than in the traditional hot dogs."], "targetTitle": "Foods and Healthy Life: Stop Eating This Food Immediately!

The terrorist attacks by Daesh (also known as ISIS or ISIL) in Europe, coupled with hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East have strengthened xenophobia, Islamophobia, and more generally, hatred of foreigners. Daesh itself is a byproduct of the invasion of Iraq that led to the emergence of al-Qaeda in Iraq, morphing into its present state as a result of the wars in Libya and Syria. Can things get any worse? Not only can they, we should expect new wars in the Middle East if Hillary Rodham Clinton, the presumptive Democratic candidate for president is elected next November. Even a glance at her record and the neoconservatives\u2019 enthusiasm for her presidency indicate how likely new wars in the Middle East will be.", "Hillary Clinton is a hawk and warmonger. People often point to her vote in 2002 for going to war in Iraq and her enthusiasm for it. After all, it was during her husband\u2019s presidency that toppling the regime of Saddam Hussein became the official policy of the United States. But, her track record of starting and supporting wars, and siding with despots is much deeper than Iraq. She supported the coup in Honduras in 2009 and in Ukraine in 2014; was the leading advocate of the U.S. and NATO intervention in Libya that turned that economically advanced nation into a hub for all types of terrorist groups; laughed shamelessly at the news of Muammar Ghaddafi\u2019s murder; supported extra-judicial assassinations by drones; backed escalation of the war in Afghanistan ordered by President Obama, and has taken an extremely hawkish stance toward Russia. And as Secretary of State she supported massive sale of advanced US weapons to Saudi Arabia and its allies in the Persian Gulf area, all reactionary dictatorships, the same weapons that are being used to attack Yemen.", "The only \"accomplishments\" that she is still lacking are starting a war with Iran and invading Syria. If she is elected president, she may get to add both to her \"impeccable\" track record of war, bloodshed and destruction and in the process spark World War III, if it has not already begun as a result of US policy toward the Middle East.", "Clinton considers Syria and Iran closely linked. In fact, most objective experts and analysts do believe that the war in Syria has a lot to do with Iran, its strategic alliance with Syria, its use of Syrian territory to help the Lebanese Hezbollah, and more generally what the Sunni Arab regimes of the region consider as the \"Shiite crescent\" \u2013 the alliance between the Shiites in Iran, Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Lebanon.", "So, before the war began in Syria in 2011, she supported secret negotiations between Israel and Syria as a way of separating the latter from Iran. But, the negotiations failed, as they always do, due to Israel\u2019s intransigence. Thus, to her destroying Syria in order to topple Bashar al-Assad became the pathway for attacking Iran, which she views as necessary for Israel\u2019s sake, as the Clintons have deep connections to Israel and its lobby in the United States", "Her advocacy of direct US intervention in Syria began carefully. One of her top aides, Ann-Marie Slaughter who was director of policy planning at the State Department from 2009-2011, published a piece in the New York Times in February 2012 advocating foreign military intervention in Syria. Clinton herself became a leading force in putting together the so-called \"friends of Syria\" group, consisting of several Western nations and the very Arab regimes that despise Iran and have played the most important role in keeping the war continuing in Syria, namely, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Jordan, as well as Turkey. The group is similar to the Contact Group on Libya, also known as \"friends of Libya,\" which consisted essentially of the same countries and was created to help the opposition forces in Libya in 2011, and we all know what that help led to.", "But, Hillary Clinton has gone even further. In an interview with the CNN she claimed Syria and Iran (as well as Russia) helped creating the Daesh, saying, \"ISIS was primarily the result of the vacuum in Syria caused by Assad first and foremost. Aided and abetted by Iran and Russia.\"", "Despite Clinton\u2019s skepticism about a nuclear agreement with Iran, P5+1 and Iran signed the historic nuclear agreement in July 2015 after Iran made many significant concessions. After the nuclear accord the hope was that rapprochement between Iran and the United States would slowly develop. At the same time, it became crystal clear to practically everyone, from the President and his Vice President Joe Biden, to even the editors of the New York Times that Saudi Arabia and its allies are the main sponsors of terrorism in the Middle East. They are also raping the poor nation of Yemen with US logistic and military support.", "Yet, Hillary Clinton is still singing the same old worn out songs and espousing the same failed policies toward Iran: more sanctions, more military threats, and more diplomatic pressure. This is of course neither new nor surprising. Along with the neocons, the Clintons have always been Iran\u2019s number one enemy in the US political establishment.", "The cliche\u0301 in the West is that it is Iran that does not want improved relations with the West. That is not true, at least not when Iranian reformists, moderates, and pragmatists have been in power. Three times over the past 20 years the Iranian reformists and moderates have tried to improve the relations between their nation and the United States, and in each case the Clintons have either prevented the rapprochement or, as it is happening now, try to scuttle it.", "In May 1995 former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, considered a pragmatist then but allied firmly with the reformists now, made a gesture of reconciliation toward the US by awarding the American oil company Conoco a major contract to develop a large offshore oil field in the Persian Gulf, although a European oil company had actually won the bidding for the contract. But, instead of responding in kind, Bill Clinton imposed total trade embargo on Iran in 1996 as part of his absurd, and ultimately failed \"dual containment\" policy according to which both Iran and Iraq were supposed to be contained and put in a strategic box.", "Then, in 1998 former reformist President proposed \"dialogue among civilizations\" as a cautious approach to open dialogue between the two nations. Not only had Khatami won the presidential elections in 1997 in a landslide, his allies would sweep the first nationwide elections for city councils in fall of 1998 and for the Majles[Iranian parliament] in February 2000. But, once again, instead of making a major gesture toward Iranian democrats by lifting the economic sanctions, or at least suspending them, Bill Clinton announced that Iran could export pistachio, carpet and caviar to the United States, as if that would impress any Iranian. The Clinton administration claimed that it was seriously seeking formal dialogue with Iran, but Khatami was not interested, unless major sanctions against Iran would first be lifted, which were not.", "After Hillary Clinton was elected a Senator from New York in 2000, she supported every resolution by Congress imposing unilateral sanctions on Iran. All such sanctions are illegal because they have not been approved by the United Nations Security Council. As Secretary of State Mrs. Clinton took the lead in putting together a coalition of Western nations that imposed \"the toughest sanctions\" in history on Iran. The sanctions hurt the lives of tens of millions of ordinary Iranians. Now that she is running for President again, Clinton\u2019s campaign brags about her role in putting in place the sanctions, as she does in her memoir as Secretary of State, Hard Choices.", "In an interview with ABC in 2008, when Mrs. Clinton was running for President, she was asked what she would do if Iran attacked Israel with nuclear weapons, to which she responded, \"I want the Iranians to know that if I\u2019m the president, we will attack Iran. In the next 10 years, during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on Israel we would be able to totally obliterate them\" (emphasis mine). Iran did not and does not have nuclear weapons and Clinton knew it, but she did not even declare that if Iran attacked Israel, which is highly unlikely if not impossible (unless Israel attacks first), she would defend Israel. Her threat to obliterate Iran, a very large country, can be accomplished by only one means: Attacking Iran with nuclear weapons.", "Even though Clinton\u2019s most important \"accomplishment\" as Secretary of State, namely, attacking Libya under the guise of \"humanitarian intervention,\" which was nothing but naked military aggression, has been a total catastrophe, in interviews with the BBC and Voice of America in October 2011 she claimed that Iran is moving toward a military dictatorship. While the leaders of Iran\u2019s Green Movement, a democratic and peaceful movement that emerged after Iran\u2019s fraudulent presidential elections of June 2009, rejected any US help, Clinton said in the interviews that if they had asked for help, the US was prepared to help them the way it helped Libyan rebels. In other words, the US would have tried regime change in Iran.", "Although Hillary Clinton claims that she supports the nuclear accord with Iran, she never misses a chance to demonize and belittles Iran. In a speech at the Brookings Institution last September, Clinton declared, \"I don\u2019t see Iran as our partner in implementing this agreement. I believe Iran is the subject of the agreement\" (emphasis mine), as if Iran is a banana republic that is subject to US will. In an article in TheJewish Journal she threatened Iran again,", "\"We have to send Iran an unequivocal message. There can be no doubt in Tehran that if Iran\u2019s leaders violate their commitments not to seek, develop, or acquire any nuclear weapons, the United States will stop them. They will test our resolve with actions like their provocative ballistic missile test, for which we should impose new sanctions designations. They need to understand that America will act decisively if Iran violates the nuclear agreement, including taking military action if necessary.\" (emphasis added).", "Clinton\u2019s rhetoric regarding Iran, even after the nuclear accord, only creates trouble for the administration of President Hassan Rouhani in the midst of his fierce power struggle with Tehran\u2019s hardliners. By taking a hardline toward the nuclear agreement and improved relations with Iran, Hillary Clinton is a strong ally of Iranian hardliners who also do not want any rapprochement with the United States.", "In addition to constantly demonizing Iran, Hillary Clinton is always looking for ways of imposing new economic sanctions on Iran to carry favor with the pro-Israel lobby and its rich donors. For example, it is well known that Iranian hardliners were, and still are opposed to the nuclear agreement with P5+1, just as the neocons and the extreme right in the United States opposed it and still do. So, the Iranian hardliners have tried to demonstrate their unhappiness with the nuclear accord, and one way of doing so, in addition to creating other problems for the Rouhani administration, has been testing ballistic missiles. The missiles are purely defensive weapons meant to deter Israel and the tests, unlike what the opposition to the nuclear accord in the United States claims, do not violate UN Security Council Resolution 2231 that was issued after the nuclear accord to endorse it. Despite these glaring facts, after the missile tests, Mrs. Clinton quickly called for new sanctions against Iran.", "During the primary season the Clinton campaign slammed Senator Sanders\u2019 suggestion that the US and Iran should have closer relations. Jake Sullivan, Hillary Clinton\u2019s senior policy adviser, said on January 21, \"This proposal [by Sanders] to more aggressively normalize relations and to move to warm relations with Iran not only breaks with President Obama\u2019s policy, it breaks with the sober and responsible diplomatic approach that\u2019s been working for the United States.\" This is not surprising. Hardliners everywhere are allies of each other and feed one another, and Clinton and Tehran\u2019s hardliners are no exception.", "Not only does Hillary Clinton not want improved relations with Iran, she has been itching to find an excuse start a war with that nation and, thus, she constantly demonizes Iran. But, in addition to demonizing Iran, she also lies about that nation brazenly. For example, similar to Benjamin Netanyahu she always refers collectively to Iran, Daesh and the Palestinian group Hamas, as if they are allies. Iran has been fighting Daesh in both Syria and Iraq. Iran cut off its financial aid to Hamas after that organization refused to back Bashar al-Assad in Syria. There is absolutely no relation between Hamas and Daesh. In fact, many senior Israeli officers have made it clear that they prefer Hamas to run Gaza, because the alternative would be either Daesh or one of the terrorist groups allied with it,", "Why is Mrs. Clinton so anti-Iran? I can think of at least two reasons. One is that Hillary Clinton has never given up her imperial ambitions to reshape the Middle East, because she believes in American \"exceptionalism\" and always speaks about \"American global leadership,\" which only means world dominance. She sees Iran as an impediment to her ambitions for the Middle East. Why does she want to reshape the Middle East and possibly change the borders? This brings us to the second reason for her being anti-Iran. Clinton is an Israel \"firster.\" Anything that she wants for the Middle East is intended for making the region as \"safe\" for Israel as possible. Clinton is not bothered by the fact that Israel is run by the far right with expansionist ambitions. To see this, all one has to do is listening to her speech at the annual meeting of AIPAC in March.", "When asked during her first Democratic presidential debate last October \"which enemy are you most proud of,\" Hillary Clinton included \"the Iranians\" among them. This was truly disturbing. Was she talking about 80 million Iranians? If she meant the Iranian government, why did she not say so? Why did she not make it clear that she meant, for example, Tehran\u2019s hardliners? Apparently, Hillary Clinton considers all Iranians as the enemy, which is truly disturbing.", "Those who argue that we should vote for Clinton as the lesser of two evils in the upcoming presidential elections are truly misguided. Yes, for decades if not longer elections in the United State have been reduced to choosing between bad and worse. But, not this time. Hillary Clinton is simply as terrible as Donald Trump, if not worse. Expect new catastrophic wars in the Middle East, especially one with Iran, if she is elected.", "This article (Expect Hillary to Do This Almost Immediately If She Wins in November) by Muhammad Sahimi, originally appeared on AntiWar.com and was used with permission.

The gardens range in size from one megawatt to five megawatts, and cover between six and 30 acres of land. Local utility companies purchase energy from the solar garden, and then community members subscribe to the solar garden and receive solar credits on their utility bill.", "\"We think we can change the energy industry because demand for a type of power has never really driven the electricity industry in this country. What you had was more supply side determinations based on regulatory processes and monopoly utilities,\" says David. \"Our hypothesis and what we\u2019ve proven is that people will change, and people making choices with their pocketbooks drives change. Solar energy is beating the costs of natural gas plants across the country right now, even the operating costs, and that\u2019s not even including the volatility premium you\u2019d have to price in to a natural gas plant you\u2019d be building for 20 years. You\u2019ve got the economic plus the environmental benefits that really make solar a win-win for both utilities and consumers.\"", "Yet change is not always easy, and David has had to work against systems that have been in place for a century as he pioneers a new way of providing power.", "\"The challenges are working with utilities that aren\u2019t really built for this new operating system that comes with the renewable and distributed energy infrastructure, so having solar and wind farms around the country near the source of where people are consuming energy. That\u2019s not how this country has looked at consuming energy previously. You\u2019re basically going from one of those old DOS operating systems to Windows XP. It\u2019s a completely different experience,\" he says. \"That\u2019s really what we\u2019re talking about in terms of the difference in how energy is transferred across the grid, managed across the grid, consumed across the grid, and tracked across the grid. It\u2019s that much of a difference. So you\u2019re working with this industry that\u2019s built on a DOS platform with DOS economics. Changing that mindset is probably one of the biggest challenges, but economics are driving that; it\u2019s a powerful force.\"", "As he pursues making solar power affordable and available, he\u2019s at a unique vantage point to predict how the energy industry will ultimately change. In addition to the choices available to people, David predicts it will be easier for utility companies to monitor their energy output.", "\"I think you\u2019re going to be able to track energy usage so that you can much more closely match energy production to energy demand. Previously power plants might be operating consistently 24 hours a day because they really can\u2019t be shut off. You can\u2019t just turn off a coal-fired power plant for four hours in a day. You end up burning a lot more energy, a lot more coal, for example, at nighttime than is actually being used on the system,\" he says. \"So you\u2019ll see a lot less waste in the system, which overall will significantly reduce our energy consumption as a country.\"", "Energy of the future will also be more reliable and secure. \"It\u2019s going to be terrorist-proof: you\u2019re not going to have single points of weakness on the system where terrorists can disrupt our access to electricity. By that, I mean localized, renewable energy creates backup support systems on the grid that don\u2019t fail with natural disasters or terrorism,\" says David."], "targetTitle": "What Will Make The Future Of Energy Terrorist-Proof?", "targetDescription": null, "targetKeywords": null, "targetMedia": ["http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2017/02/methane-burn-180x122.jpg?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2017/02/UNEMPLOYED-180x122.jpg?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/02/Terrorist.jpg", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2017/02/1339818-oil-anniversary-slide-07-1-424x282.jpg?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2017/02/1339818-oil-anniversary-slide-07-1-180x122.jpg?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/09/6089_grande-180x122.jpg?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2017/02/UNEMPLOYED-424x282.jpg?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2017/02/exxonnmobil-02-180x122.jpg?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/01/TheSurge_small.png?x15124", "http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/591fb988757c3c376698a78b35d9193d?s=75&d=http%3A%2F%2Fthesurge.com%2Fapp%2Fthemes%2Fabsolute%2Fimages%2Favatar.png&r=g", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/02/SunShare_AUG_4_2015-35-1024x683.jpg?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/08/WestTexasUpdate-Option2-180x122.jpg?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2017/02/exxonnmobil-02-424x282.jpg?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/02/sunshare-portraits-2773-788x1024.jpg?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/01/SquareLogo-White473x200-1.png?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2017/01/Daily-Surge-2-1-180x122.jpg?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/02/Terrorist-200x200.jpg?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/12/bpships-180x122.png?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/12/bpships-424x282.png?x15124"], "targetUrl": "http://thesurge.com/stories/what-will-make-the-future-of-energy-terrorist-proof", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "Diversified energy sources reduces the chance of a total attack on power supply, as opposed to a singular source. #StopClickBait", "spoilerPublisher": "Stop Clickbait - Science"}, "spoiler": ["I mean localized, renewable energy creates backup support systems on the grid"], "spoilerPositions": [[[8, 225], [8, 302]]], "tags": ["passage"], "predicted_labels": 1}

As an emerging medium, messaging is bigger than even Facebook. It\u2019s the most widely used smartphone feature in the U.S., and it\u2019s already taking a bite out of social media. As of the beginning of this year, according to Business Insider\u2019s Intelligence Reports, the top four messaging apps\u2014WeChat, Viber, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp\u2014have already eclipsed the top four social networking apps\u2014Twitter, Linkedin, Facebook and Instagram\u2014in their aggregate monthly active users.", "This rapid growth is also poised to leave the rest of the mobile app ecosystem in the dust. According to eMarketer, more than 1.4 billion consumers were using messaging apps by the end of 2015; that\u2019s 75% of all smartphone users and an increase of 31.6% over the previous year. And that number has grown rapidly since. As of this week, Facebook Messenger has already amassed 900 million users on its own. At a time when most smartphone users download zero apps per month and a quarter of all downloaded apps are abandoned after a single use, users are spending an average of 200 minutes a week on WhatsApp.", "So, this is clearly a medium we should pay attention to. But how should publishers and news organizations play with it? To answer that question, we need to grasp what it is about messaging that\u2019s allowed it to become pervasive, so that we can gain a better understanding of how content could fit comfortably on it.", "Why Messaging Is Different", "Text messages\u2014the ubiquitous kind that are primarily used by consumers on their mobile devices\u2014more aptly mimic the fluidity of human communication than other digital forms. The technology embedded in text messages sits in the background versus in your way. For instance, you can respond to a text message immediately or whenever is most convenient for you. It doesn\u2019t require conversing parties to be available simultaneously, as a phone call or video chat does, nor does it assume that people would rather correspond asynchronously, as with email.", "Text messages also offer a better representation of a person\u2019s relationships by focusing on long-term conversations. Messages are typically organized in a list form that is automatically updated every time you interact with it. The people you talk to most frequently and recently at any given moment surface at the top of that list. You don\u2019t have to manually program and repeatedly update the list in the way you may have back when you added your friends and family members to phone-based speed dial, or in the way you need to tell Facebook which friends are closer to you than others, a status that can change from time to time.", "Also, in the context of the text message thread, a message you receive carries the expectation that you will engage with it. In this fundamental way, messaging differs from push notifications or alerts, which instead serve to simply broadcast information. The expectation with an alert is that as soon as you interact with it, it goes away. As soon as you interact with a text message, it sits at the top of your messaging list.", "This focus on fluidity and conversation allows text messaging to more adequately fit the demands of our dynamic circumstances and relationships than other forms of digital communication. To successfully engage with the medium, therefore, publishers should harness these unique features that have made messaging powerful.", "Cost Center or Revenue Stream?", "Publishers will also need to know if messaging offers a clear path\u2014or at least a dimly lit one\u2014to monetization in order to see how widely they can experiment and whether this new outlet will represent a new cost center or revenue stream. While it\u2019s too early to tell, there are a few unique related aspects that are potentially promising.", "By virtue of it living on your phone messaging is a natural access point to both your social and mobile data.", "By virtue of it living on your phone, natively harnessing an ongoing memory of your conversations and serving as the best digital representation of your relationships, messaging is a natural access point to both your social and mobile data. For instance, Facebook Messenger is aware of your identity, social graph, location, conversation history and more. This ongoing memory\u2014coupled with the fact that users are already becoming increasingly comfortable with making payments on their mobile devices\u2014positions in-messaging payment services as potential facilitators of paywalled content. Once they set up their relationship with a service like Stripe or Facebook Messenger\u2019s native payments feature, users can theoretically convert to paying subscribers with a quick text versus detailing their personal and financial information at every point of sale. This could make payments via messaging more effortless than they are to facilitate via websites.", "This unique access to data also allows for messaging to support personalized and perhaps more appropriate user interactions with sponsors. As opposed to simply serving banner ads that may feel disruptive to the conversational experience, messaging apps have the potential to serve offers based on a user\u2019s preferences. In this vein, Facebook Messenger revealed that it will be experimenting with sponsored messages.", "Since preserving a personal tone is essential to the messaging experience, publishers and advertisers will likely explore this area cautiously, so we will hopefully see more intuitive exercises in commercialization using this new medium. For instance, since Facebook Messenger may already know of some services and companies you \"like\" via the data you have fed the parent platform over time, it will probably prioritize facilitating messages between you and those companies you already trust and may want to hear from. On the flip side, if an advertiser gets too noisy or feels irrelevant, you can easily block them from messaging you again.", "Editorial Experiments", "Before monetizing it, publishers need to test the medium itself. The most obvious, lowest-friction way to experiment within messaging platforms is to simply focus on them as new distribution points for content that\u2019s already been created. Predictably, many big publishers have dipped their toes in this way; for instance, The Economist and Buzzfeed both experimented with the messaging app Line to push out news alerts that include links back to their respective publications for the full stories. Setting up this type of experience is similar to using Twitter to alert users; simply create an account on a text messaging app, allow users to subscribe to that account and either manually send out notifications or set up automated news alerts.", "While easy and cheap to fulfill, this use case renders an experience that\u2019s closer to that of a billboard than a conversation, which is why The Economist deemed the exercise a \"brand building initiative.\" Since the user can\u2019t really interact with the message, at best this experiment\u2019s results will be commensurate with the effort, and at worst, they may mirror punishment by way of a slow release of the entire works of Shakespeare over text.", "In taking a step towards experimenting with the conversational aspect of messaging, some publishers have run efforts like live editorial commentary. In this paradigm, a publication\u2019s staff members chat amongst themselves\u2014for instance, discussing a news event\u2014and the subscribed audience can follow the conversation as it unfolds and maybe even participate in the discussion.", "The Guardian hosted a WhatsApp chat alongside the GOP debates in December, and The Huffington Post ran a similar effort around various news topics on Viber. Another related use case involving editorial conversation is acting out a script. The BBC recently used Viber to tell the story of a real kidnapping in Mexico by having its editorial staff role play using actual quotes from people involved in the case.", "As in the news alert use case, for this type of experience publishers need to create accounts on messaging platforms and build their subscriber bases. But this experiment also calls for extra time commitments from editorial staffers to write scripts and/or run the live chats. It can also require an outside trigger event, like a debate, to be happening concurrently on another screen that chat subscribers are also tuning in to.", "Chatbots", "While potentially engaging, hosting live conversations on messaging apps is resource-intensive and limited in its interaction with end users, as editors can\u2019t scale themselves to respond to every user\u2019s question or comment. This problem has prompted publishers to experiment with chatbots to allow users to interact with the news.", "In the context of text messaging, a bot is an account operated by software in place of a person. Given a pre-prescribed set of rules a human editor makes, a bot can theoretically respond to a user in a way that mimics a human response. Quartz recently released a news app that sends a user a blurb about a story and employs a bot to ask the user to select between reading more about that specific story or moving on to the next story.", "Forbesbot on Telegram", "CNN created a similar bot on Facebook Messenger using the just-released Send and Receive API, and publications like Forbes and TechCrunch have created bots on the messaging platform Telegram using bot creator Chatfuel. Purple is yet another similarly powered bot that texts users with election news, allowing them to delve deeper into a subtopic within a message by texting back a pre-designated keyword (e.g., \"Kasich\") contained within that original bot message. Powering these experiences relies on a diligent, combined effort of developing a bot (frequently via a third party) and dedicating editorial resources to writing short, conversational prose out of published stories.", "In its current state, the news bot is a novelty that more closely mimics the experience of interacting with an automatic phone teller than talking to a human journalist. The seemingly endless loop of repeatedly hitting buttons or expressing keywords in order to get a response to a specific question can leave a user quickly fatigued. The underlying problem is that bots are essentially formulas created to handle a limited set of scenarios within a pre-defined framework, and they haven\u2019t gotten to the point where they can manage massive banks of scenarios smoothly enough to handle every-day decisions.", "This problem isn\u2019t so different from why, with self-driving vehicles, \"We\u2019re clearly pretty close to making a car that can handle highway driving with no human input, since the range of possible events is pretty small,\" says Benedict Evans, a partner at the venture capital fund Andreesen Horowitz. \"But driving in central Rome or Moscow is an entirely different matter that needs an entirely different level of decision-making: What does that hand gesture mean?\"", "To handle the multitude of scenarios presented in an open-ended system like chat, we need a far more sophisticated bot that can scalably and quickly run decisions based on all potential user inputs, a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that can more holistically mimic human conversations.", "The current limitations of chatbots haven\u2019t stopped messaging platforms like Telegram, Kik and Facebook Messenger from launching their own bot ecosystems, nor have they hindered publications like The Washington Post from creating their own homegrown bots. The promise of true AI\u2014an interaction framework that would allow news providers to offer each of their users a bespoke conversational experience at scale\u2014is far too meaningful to give up on. That\u2019s why, in tandem with releasing its limited-scope Send and Recieve API for bot creators, Facebook has also released Bot Engine, a system based on machine learning that can pave the way for more complex scenarios, like handling different variations of the same user questions.", "AI-powered News", "Looking to the future, you can imagine an AI-based chatbot that truly comprehends intention behind language, a bot that you can have long-term discussions with about the news the way you would with a well-informed friend. This intelligent bot could also fulfill the promise of voice-based products like Apple\u2019s Siri or Amazon\u2019s Alexa. It would both learn who you are and understand the content within stories enough to surface news you\u2019d likely be interested in, whether or not you explicitly told it you were\u2014or perhaps before you even knew you were. This type of bot would be promising in the sense that it may change the current rut we are in with digital news, a relationship which Twitter\u2019s co-founder and Medium founder Ev Williams aptly describes as \"stuck in ... the idea that [the media people consume] is what they want.\"", "Will writers soon share the kind of power and influence over creating digital user experiences that graphical designers now have?", "While we don\u2019t currently have AI-powered news, we can start paving the way for it by crafting the right type of conversation-based frameworks for it. What\u2019s exciting about this for writers and journalists is that the archetype text messaging is based on\u2014broadly described as conversational user interface (UI)\u2014is largely driven by exposing functionality through language; \u2018designing\u2019 a killer chatbot, therefore, relies at least as much on using the right kind of language as it does on a creating a great graphical user interface. Will writers soon share the kind of power and influence over creating digital user experiences that graphical designers now have?", "Unlike websites and mobile apps, which rely heavily on navigational design and buttons to express breadth of coverage and direct users to the content they may be interested in, with chatbots \"all of your features need to be reachable solely through words\u2014so picking the right thing to say, and the tone of your dialogue with the user, is crucial,\" explains Matty Mariansky, who created MeeKan, a calendaring bot for enterprise messaging platform Slack. This new role of language can empower writers to design experiences for messaging-based services. For instance, Mariansky hired dedicated scriptwriters to come up with more than 2,000 sentences to handle a meeting request.", "While Mark Zuckerberg argues that the best messaging experiences will combine conversational and graphical UI rather than rely on words alone, the role of language as a form of user experience design becomes even more important when we start designing our bots to be flexible enough to work with both text and voice. When the bot is stripped of a screen altogether, as with services like Siri and Alexa, language is the user experience.", "It wouldn\u2019t be far-fetched, therefore, to imagine a scenario in which journalists extend their writing skills and editorial judgment to not only cover stories, but design the channels through which these stories are distributed.

According to the Rubicon Project While we may cringe at the fact that holiday decorations go up as soon as the fake Halloween cobwebs get taken down, buying early does seem to be a budgeting tactic that a lot of millennials favor. According to the Holiday Consumer Pulse survey , millennials are one of the primary groups controlling holiday spending this year. The Rubicon survey reports that millennials are predicted to spend an average of $1,427 in 2016, up from the $1,072 they spent last year. This is based off 1,003 interviews Rubicon conducted in late August 2016.", "Erin says she can see herself spending close to the millennial average by the time she\u2019s completed her shopping.

Their spending still comes second to parents (though these two categories overlap). Parents plan to spend an average of more than $1,700 this holiday season. Not only is this about $300 more than they spent in 2015 (the average was $1,383 last year), but it\u2019s also substantially more than the $903 non-parents plan to spend.", "Parents are predicted to spend $495 per child this year, which is nearly $100 more than they spent last year. However, there is a discrepancy between how much each parent spends. Male parents plan to spend slightly more per child. The survey results for millennials and parents also revealed that more than half plan to buy a gift for themselves.

And l ike Erin, 84% of shoppers research their gift selections online before committing.", "Overall, the average holiday shopper will spend $1,175 this year, up from last year\u2019s average of $1,051. Of those surveyed, 44% plan to spend more this year than they did in 2015.", "In addition, Cyber Monday sales might rival Black Friday sales this year. Of those surveyed, 42% will shop on Black Friday, but 47% will capitalize on Cyber Monday deals.

And the sooner you start, the more you\u2019ll be able to budget little by little, instead of incurring one huge financial hit in December.

However, just because you can do something, doesn't mean you have to. The development team wants players of the new game to be abler to make their own decision as to how to play the game. This has apparently worked out so well that there's one major mechanic in the game you don't ever need to touch. I had a chance to sit down with both Watch Dogs 2 as well as the game's creative director where I learned that it's possible to beat Watch Dogs 2 without ever firing a gun. Something interesting is our LV Director, he finished the game without using the shooting mechanic...He used takedowns because sometimes in stealth you have to use them, but he never shot anyone. This is kind of our goal. You don't have to kill people and you don't have to shoot. Can we achieve that? Sometimes it's very difficult in a certain context, but we did it, so I'm super proud of that actually. The great appeal of open world games is that they're supposed to give you a variety of ways to attack any objective. However, quite often those same games tend to push you down a particular path, so one game mechanic is important in one mission and another is the focus later on. Ubisoft has tried to design Watch Dogs 2 so that players have more control. Jonathan Morin, the Creative Director of Watch Dogs 2 told me that while playing the game without guns isn't easy, it is possible. Instead, there are greater opportunities for using hacking in order to reach your goal. Every hackable object can be hacked in different ways, rather than just one, meaning that you have more control over how your environment reacts to you. The addition of rovers and drones also means that the player can get access to more areas without actually having to step foot in a place where you might be spotted. As a fan of the hacking aspect of the original Watch Dogs but not so much the Grand Theft Auto style gunplay, this more wide open world sounds much more interesting. I found myself far too often needing to fight off waves of enemies with a gun in the first game when I would much rather stun them with a hackable object before they even knew I was there. While my hands-on time with Watch Dogs 2 was limited, I can say I also never used a gun. Christopher Morin told me to \"think like a hacker\" while playing Watch Dogs 2, to consider how you can use the systems to solve the problems that you're dealing with. It gives the impression that the hacking aspect of the game has been set up more like a puzzle where the player will need to figure out how to hack the different parts of the game in order to solve it. However, the most important part of making that work is that you have to believe there is a solution. Based on the fact that you can apparently beat the game using only hacks and takedowns, it would appear the solution is possible. Will you try to beat Watch Dogs 2 without using a gun?

And the prince ought to have known, having murdered him.", "Here\u2019s the story. In 1916, the fabulously wealthy, Oxford-educated Prince Felix Yusupov was one of several Russian aristocrats agonizing over the unseemly influence that Rasputin\u2014the magical healer, charismatic lech, and peasant\u2014had over the czar and, particularly, the czarina. In December, Yusupov invited Rasputin to his palace, where he offered him cyanide-laced cakes and then shot him.", "Although the czarina was distraught, the czar let Yusupov off lightly, exiling the prince and his wife Irina.

Its big coup was casting the three Barrymore siblings\u2014stars of stage and silent film\u2014in the lead roles. Lionel played Rasputin, Ethel the czarina, and John (grandfather of Drew) was \"Prince Paul Chegodieff,\" a composite, who murders Rasputin.", "Yusupov, now penniless in Paris, heard about the film and thought it defamatory. He argued audiences would recognize him in the fictional assassin\u2014in part because he\u2019d publicly cashed in on his infamy, penning a braggy memoir about killing Rasputin. He wasn\u2019t wrong: The New York Times, in its review, noted that Chegodieff was \"really intended to represent [Yusupov].\"", "But having copped to being a murderer, Yusupov couldn\u2019t build much of a libel case. Instead, he alleged that Rasputin and the Empress in fact defamed his wife.", "In the film, Chegodieff\u2019s wife is \"Princess Natasha,\" a supporter of Rasputin. But the mystic, wary of her husband, hypnotizes and rapes her, rendering Natasha\u2014by his logic, with which she agrees\u2014unfit to be a wife. Yusupov contended that as viewers would equate Chegodieff with Yusupov, so would they link Natasha with Irina. But while Yusupov was portrayed more or less accurately, Irina and Rasputin had never met. (The scene also libeled Rasputin, but him being dead, you could say anything, then as now: \"Rasputin sucks,\" \"Rasputin liked to caress his big beard and give it little kisses,\" etc.)", "An MGM researcher had pointed out this factual discrepancy to the studio during production and warned that the Yusupovs could sue; the studio fired her. MGM was satisfied, dramatically, with the rape scene, despite there being no basis for it in real life. If it was shock they were interested in, one could imagine them constructing a similar scene around Rasputin and the czarina\u2014about whom there were prurient rumors, which Rasputin himself encouraged by whipping his dick out in a restaurant and boasting of giving it to \"the old girl\"\u2014but MGM couldn\u2019t do that after casting a real-life brother and sister in those roles.", "Poster via Wikimedia Commons", "Irina Yusupov sued the studio, and the jury found in her favor, awarding her \u00a325,000, or about $125,000. MGM had to take the film out of circulation for decades and purge the offending scene for all time.", "What proved to be MGM\u2019s undoing was its lack of deniability. Unwisely, they\u2019d prefaced the film with this: \"This concerns the destruction of an empire ... A few of the characters are still alive\u2014the rest met death by violence.\" From that, audiences could logically infer that the Yusupovs, being the only relevant characters still alive, were represented as the Chegodieffs.", "A justice in the case told MGM that the studio might have stood a better chance had they incorporated a disclaimer stating the exact opposite: that the film was not intended as an accurate portrayal of real people or events.", "Apparently overcautious in the wake of the landmark lawsuit, the film industry slapped that wording on everything.

That Hanks, a two-time Best Actor winner and five-time nominee, is at his very best before the key sequence in Paul Greengrass' new film should provide Oscar prognosticators with all they need to know about the 57-year-old actor's awards chances.", "\"Captain Phillips\" is set to open the 2013 New York Film Festival, but Sony and producer Scott Rudin set up screenings this week for critics and journalists to see the film while all eyes are fixed on Toronto. Thus far, the move paid off: reviews have been solid, with some (In Contention editor Kris Tapley, HuffPost Entertainment's own Mike Ryan) more infatuated with the film than others (Variety critic Scott Foundas, The Wrap critic Alonso Duralde). Heed the words from the former camp: \"Captain Phillips\" stands at the very top of the recent spate of thinking-persons' action films from the last few years, on par with Kathryn Bigelow's \"Zero Dark Thirty\" and well ahead of Ben Affleck's Best Picture-winning \"Argo.\"", "The reason is Hanks, who gives the type of performance everyone has wanted to see from Tom Hanks since the early 2000s. His Richard Phillips is not the most emotional of men: an opening scene with his wife (played very briefly but beautifully by Catherine Keener) establishes him as the kind of thoughtful, quiet type who one can assume watches the History Channel and likes Tommy Lee Jones movies. Yet as Greengrass keeps turning the screws on Phillips and his situation, that cool demeanor begins to crack, shatter and, later, turn to dust. Hanks is put through the ringer -- Greengrass' closed-quarters camera work keeps in him the action even as things get impossibly physical -- and the results are breathtaking. Like the best acting, Hanks' performance actually feels real. By the end of the film, it's hard to tell where Hanks ends and Phillips begins.", "This is the time of year when a new Oscar front-runner debuts almost every day (\"Gravity\" and \"12 Years A Slave\" reached the top of the line after raves last week). Yet \"Captain Phillips\" belongs in those whispered early awards musings, not just for Hanks and Greengrass (a previous nominee for \"United 93,\" a film that bears similarities to \"Captain Phillips\" in structure and form), but for Best Editing (Christopher Rouse), Best Cinematography (Barry Ackroyd), Best Adapted Screenplay (Billy Ray) and, if a wave of support carries the film to multiple nominations, perhaps Best Supporting Actor for Barkhad Abdi. The newcomer plays Muse, the lead Somali pirate in the film, a relatively decent man turned to evil behavior by his standing in life. Abdi (and Barkhad Addirahman, Faysal Ahmed, Mahat M. Ali as the other pirates) helps keep the film from ever truly demonizing Phillips' kidnappers, an easy pitfall that Greengrass deftly avoids. The problem is that Abdi doesn't have an easy road to Supporting Actor: the category is as loaded as usual, with actors like Daniel Bruhl (for \"Rush\"), Michael Fassbender (for \"12 Years A Slave\"), Josh Brolin (for \"Labor Day\"), Steve Coogan (for \"Philomena\"), Bradley Cooper (for \"American Hustle\") and even Hanks (for \"Saving Mr. Banks\") potentially standing in his way.", "That, however, is back-room chatter for another day.

We were talking about how excited we were to attend an upcoming wedding in Kalamazoo (where we met and went to college) and discussing what would be the perfect gift for the newlyweds. So, I thought back to our wedding day (nearly 9 years ago) and tried to recall the gifts that had meant the most to me. The funny thing? The gift that meant the very most was still sitting in a closet... ... unopened. On our wedding day, my husband Brandon and I received a gift from my Great Aunt Alison. On the plain white box was a card that read, \"Do not open until your 1st disagreement.\" Now, there had obviously been plenty of disagreements, arguments and slammed doors throughout our 9 years. There were even a couple of instances where we both considered giving up... but we never opened the box. I honestly think that we both avoided turning to the box, because it would have symbolized our failure. To us, it would have meant that we didn\u2019t have what it takes to make our marriage work \u2013 and we\u2019re both too stubborn and determined for that. So, it forced us to reassess situations. Was it really time to open the box? What if this isn\u2019t our worst fight? What if there\u2019s a worse one ahead of us and we don\u2019t have our box?!? As my Great Uncle Bill would say, 'Nothing is ever so bad that it couldn\u2019t get worse.' All along, we assumed that the contents of that box held the key to saving a marriage \u2013 an age old trick \u2013 unbeknownst to us rookies. After all, my Great Aunt and Uncle had been married for nearly half a century. So, we thought the box would save \"us\" \u2013 and in a way it did. That box went beyond what I believe my Great Aunt had intended. It was by far the greatest wedding gift of all. For 9 years (and three moves) that box sat high on a shelf in various closets gathering dust, yet it somehow taught us about tolerance, understanding, compromise and patience. Our marriage strengthened as we became best friends, partners, and teammates. Today, we decided to open that box, because I finally had a realization. I realized that the tools for creating and maintaining a strong, healthy marriage were never within that box \u2013 they were within us.\" # LoveWhatMatters Love What Matters Original Story Submitted by Kathy Gunn See More 14K 680 3.1K", "Brandon and Kathy Gunn Kathy Gunn", "Kathy Gunn", "Brandon and Kathy Gunn Kathy Gunn", "No offense to your Vitamix, but it's safe to say that this is the greatest wedding gift of all time.Although Kathy and Brandon Gunn have been married since Sept. 1, 2007, they still had one wedding that they hadn't opened \u2013 until this May. Kathy wrote a post explaining why they'd waited to open the gift, which was from her great Aunt Alison and was attached to a note that read, \"Do not open until your first disagreement.\"\"Now, there had obviously been plenty of disagreements, arguments and slammed doors throughout our 9 years,\" she wrote in the post , which was shared by the page Love What Matters on August 29. \"There were even a couple of instances where we both considered giving up ... but we never opened the box.\"Kathy admits that they'd avoided opening the box after all these years because they thought it would have symbolized a failure. \"To us, it would have meant that we didn't have what it takes to make our marriage work \u2013 and we're both to stubborn and determined for that,\" she wrote. \"So it forced us to reassess situations. Was it really time to open the box? What if this isn't our worst fight? What if there's a worse one ahead of us and we don't have our box?!\"In May, after almost a decade and three moves, they finally decided to open the box, and found two hand-written notes wrapped around some cash, as well as wine glasses and bath products. The note to Kathy told her to buy pizza (\"or something you both like\") and prepare a bath, and the note to Brandon said, \"Go get flowers and a bottle of wine.\"In the end, Kathy wrote that they had been enjoying this gift for almost a decade, even though the box \u2013 which she calls \"the greatest wedding gift of all\" \u2013 hadn't been opened.\"I realized that the tools for creating a strong, healthy marriage were never within that box \u2013 they were within us.\"In an interview with PEOPLE, Kathy opened up about how their story has inspired other couples.\"My husband and I are in awe of how much attention this story has garnered,\" she says. \"I had only intended to give credit to my great aunt and share how important the box was for my husband and I \u2013 and the lessons that it had inadvertently taught us. Now that our story has gotten so much attention and has inspired others, it seems to be the gift that keeps on giving!\"As for her wise great aunt, Kathy says, \"She is just tickled by how much attention this has gotten \u2013 how many people have shared that they wish they had an 'Aunt Alison' and those that think her gift was absolutely genius. She didn't realize just how special the gift was to us until a number of years after our wedding when she found out that we hadn\u2019t opened it yet.\"Aunt Alison was surprised that we kept it for nine years, then the lessons it taught us \u2013 inadvertently \u2013 and now she\u2019s even more surprised at the response our story has received.\"And when it comes to their best advice to other couples when it comes to handling disagreements, she says, \"For the little things, learn how to disagree and move on. For the bigger things, learn how to get mad and get over it. Giving up was never an option in our situation because we never had the illusion that marriage was going to be easy. Building that strong foundation is hard work \u2013 but once it\u2019s set, it will provide a lifetime of friendship, partnership and love.\""], "targetTitle": "Wedding Gift Opened After 9 Years At

Do you want to tell which state Springfield is in?\"", "So by this point, with \"The Simpsons\" entering its 28th season and still officially maintaining the mystery, any clue as to where the real Springfield is could be noteworthy.", "The Simpson family has resided in the American town of Springfield for nearly three decades. But despite millions of fellow Americans watching their lives every week, nobody has ever figured out where their \"Springfield\" actually is. The town name is extremely popular in this country and the family\u2019s creator, Matt Groening, has never quite revealed its true location.", "Groening has actually said in the past that the Springfield in the show was named after Springfield, Oregon, but didn\u2019t go so far as to admit \"street names and locations\" were, as well.", "In 2012, Smithsonian Magazine titled a piece In 2012, Smithsonian Magazine titled a piece \"Matt Groening Reveals the Location of the Real Springfield.\" Here\u2019s part of the piece that gets into the Oregon connection:", "OK, why do the Simpsons live in a town called Springfield? Isn\u2019t that a little generic? Springfield was named after Springfield, Oregon. The only reason is that when I was a kid, the TV show \"Father Knows Best\" took place in the town of Springfield, and I was thrilled because I imagined that it was the town next to Portland, my hometown. When I grew up, I realized it was just a fictitious name. I also figured out that Springfield was one of the most common names for a city in the U.S. In anticipation of the success of the show, I thought, \"This will be cool; everyone will think it\u2019s their Springfield.\" And they do. You\u2019ve never said it was named after Springfield, Oregon, before, have you? I don\u2019t want to ruin it for people, you know? Whenever people say it\u2019s Springfield, Ohio, or Springfield, Massachusetts, or Springfield, wherever, I always go, \"Yup, that\u2019s right.\"", "This article led to quite a bit of backtracking from both Groening and Jean as they then claimed the location of the town still remained a mystery. The show responded to the article with a chalkboard gag where Bart Simpson repeatedly wrote, \"The true location of Springfield is in any state but yours.\"", "Jean told Jean told TV Guide at the time that Smithsonian Magazine \"misinterpreted something [he has] heard [Groening] say for at least 10 or 20 years.\" Jean continued, \"He was inspired by growing up in Portland, but it\u2019s really an every town. It\u2019s really funny. Matt grew up in Oregon and parts of \u2018The Simpsons\u2019 were definitely inspired by his childhood. But there is no specific state that Springfield is in, and we will never reveal that secret.\"", "Further trying to dispel that Groening revealed the location, Jean reminded TV Guide readers that \"The Simpsons Movie\" hinted that the town\u2019s true whereabouts are geographically impossible.", "\"In the movie we say [Springfield] borders on Ohio, Nevada, Maine and Kentucky,\" said Jean. \"So good luck finding that state. When you do, you\u2019re a true \u2018Simpsons\u2019 fan.\"", "For what it\u2019s worth, Ohio has a city named Oregon. The state of Oregon does border Nevada. The city of Portland, Oregon, was named after the city of Portland, Maine. And there is an unincorporated community that calls itself \"Oregon\" in Kentucky.", "In a way (however tenuous), all of those named states from the movie have geographical connections to Oregon. \"The Simpsons\" Springfield = Springfield, Oregon. The homepage of the official website for the Oregonian city even claims, \"Yes, this is the \u2018real\u2019 Springfield from \u2018The Simpsons.\u2019\"", "Of course, even if this is true, Jean and Groening will likely never fully admit it.

It's a very difficult spell.\"", "In both the books and the films, the Patronus charm is one of the most powerful defense spells a witch or wizard can cast to ward off Dementors, the dark creatures that feed off human happiness.", "It's one of the most complex spells in the wizarding world, and in order to conjure a Patronus, a wizard needs to draw upon his most powerful happy memory. The Charm conjures a magical guardian in the shape of the animal with whom the witch or wizard shares the greatest affinity.", "Rowling's response may point to the fact that the spell is simply too difficult for Hagrid, who was expelled from Hogwarts as a teenager, to perform. But fans were also worried that the lovable half-giant, abandoned by his mother as a child, may just not have enough happy memories to produce a Patronus. Oh, Hagrid!"], "targetTitle": "J.K.

Exhibit a: a \u2018game\u2019 which lets users squeeze a virtual woman\u2019s breasts who responds by squealing in disgust and covering up her chest.

The average (median, technically) across all couples, though, was 5.4 minutes. This means that if you line up the 500 couples from shortest sex to longest sex, the middle couple goes for an average of 5.4 minutes each time they do it.", "There were some interesting secondary results, too. For example, condom use didn\u2019t seem to affect the time, and neither did men\u2019s being circumcised or not, which challenges some conventional wisdom regarding penile sensitivity and its relationship to staying power in the sack.", "It didn\u2019t much matter which country the couples came from either \u2013 unless they came from Turkey, in which case their sex tended to be significantly shorter (3.7 minutes) than couples from other countries (Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States). Another surprising finding was that the older the couple, the shorter the sex, contrary to the prevailing wisdom (probably peddled by older men).", "Why do we have sex for so long?", "As an evolutionary researcher, all this talk of how long sex lasts make me wonder: Why does it last any time at all? All sex really needs to achieve, it seems, is to put sperm into the vagina. Why all the thrusting and bumping? Instead of sliding the penis in and out many hundreds of times per sexual session, why not just put it in once, ejaculate, and then go have a lemonade and get on with the rest of the day?", "Before you say, Because it\u2019s fun to go in and out!, remember evolution doesn\u2019t care about fun per se \u2013 it generally only \"designs\" things to be enjoyable if they helped our ancestors pass on their genes to future generations.

For an immunologist Fantastic Voyage is interesting as it was made when there were competing theories of how antibodies worked", "One, the instructional theory, suggested that all antibody molecules were the same, but they folded themselves around their target and learned its shape \u2013 to forestall future invasions \u2013 before destroying it. The alternative \u2013 clonal selection theory \u2013 says that there were billions of different antibodies, each with a different shape. Each B cell (a type of immune cell) specialises in making just one type of antibody. When a foreign invader, such as bacteria, enters the body, only one B cell will recognise it. That B cell would begin to rapidly divide, making large numbers of clones. These newly cloned B cells secrete large amounts of antibody which stick to the invader and mark it for destruction.", "The instructional theory was championed by no less a person than two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling , while Macfarlane Burnet (also a Nobel Prize winner) was the key proponent of clonal selection . The makers of the film followed Pauling, though, whether this was for scientific reasons or because the interaction between stringy antibodies and Welch made for better cinema isn\u2019t clear. However, they were wrong, clonal selection theory won the argument.", "Nowadays clonal selection seems so obviously right that it is difficult to remember that it initially appeared to have a fatal flaw. Scientists knew that the immune system of an animal could make antibodies to any foreign antigen. In the 1930s Karl Landsteiner showed that antibodies could be made to chemicals that never even existed naturally.", "This led to a problem: for the clonal theory to be correct, there had to be pre-existing antibodies in animals or humans capable of recognising any antigen that might ever exist. This would require billions of different antibodies. And as every antibody is encoded by a separate gene, for there to be billions of antibody molecules there would also have to be billions of different genes. But there are no more than 25,000 genes to encode for everything in the human body, considerably fewer than needed to make the clonal selection theory possible.", "The GOD problem", "in several In the 1960s and 70s immunologists were increasingly convinced by the clonal selection theory. This led to a race to discover the solution to the problem of how so many different antibodies could be encoded. It was termed the \"generation of diversity\", or GOD problem. The GOD problem was such an important and intriguing question that it attracted many of the best scientists of the decade, and resulted Nobel Prizes . Scientists showed that GOD was due to several biological mechanisms that people had not realised could happen, including rearrangement of chunks of DNA in chromosomes, and deliberate mutation of DNA sequences", "The difficulty and novelty of the science meant that immunologists had to develop new technologies. And some of these techniques, which were used to answer fundamental questions, ended up having practical applications. Perhaps most notably Ce\u0301sar Milstein was interested in understanding how, during an immune response, antibodies improve and become better at binding to their antigens. He wanted to immunise an animal and then, at various times, isolate B cells to make antibodies. He could then use these to study how well they bound to their antigen, and also sequence the gene encoding the antibody to see how it changed over time. In doing so he developed, together with Georges Ko\u0308hler in 1975, a method that made B cells live forever, making limitless amounts of what they called a monoclonal antibody", "Milstein realised that their technique, called hybridoma technology, had much wider applications in science and medicine. The impact of monoclonal antibodies as scientific tools and for the treatment of diseases has been immense. Because they can be made in large amounts, and are specific, they are used in many experiments and clinical tests. They have now also become an important type of drug , having an important role to play in treating many cancers as well as other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis . In economic terms, monoclonal antibody therapies are estimated to have had sales of US$75 billion in 2013.", "In an age that demands that science is useful and should be applied, it is perhaps worth remembering that one of the most important technologies in medicine and biology was developed to answer a very basic scientific question. Scientists are motivated to develop new techniques to answer important questions. They often later find that these techniques have important practical applications beyond their original purpose.

For perhaps the first time in my life, I felt like a sexual square.", "Then, a week later, heavily circulated rumors (that have been completely unverified) alleged that R&B singer Usher\u2019s unreleased sex tape showed him on the receiving end of sex with his wife (perhaps wielding a strap-on). It\u2019s no secret that more Americans are having anal sex than ever before: A study published last year in the Journal of Sexual Medicine found that more than 45 percent of women in their late 20s had tried anal sex. For my generation, the back-door option is like what the blow job was to the generation that came before \u2014 just a fun new taboo waiting to be broken. The phenomenon of heterosexual guys participating in all sorts of arse play is something different, though. I\u2019ve seen female-on-male strap-on sex go from the sort of thing tittered about in women\u2019s magazines to hearing a male friend once drunkenly blurting out in a bar that he loved it.", "But I live in San Francisco; my sample is skewed. I set out to find some reliable data on the matter, but no such luck. As Debby Herbenick, a co-author of the study mentioned above and a sexual health educator at the Kinsey Institute, told me: \"There is no good national-level data on this topic.\" Her research reflected that 11 percent of men in their early 20s reported having been on the receiving end of anal sex. But that survey didn\u2019t specify whether there was a sex toy or penis involved, or if it was oral or digital stimulation.", "Without solid stats, the best way to get some perspective on this phenomenon is to talk to sexologists. Charlie Glickman, a Good Vibrations sex educator, told me that he believed \"more heterosexual men are discovering prostate and anal play with their female partners than ever before.\" His colleague Carol Queen, a staff sexologist, says, \"Lots of guys don\u2019t talk about [it], but do it anyway,\" and \"plenty of heterosexual men include anal penetration in masturbation at least sometimes.\" In the years after her educational X-rated video \"Bend Over Boyfriend\" premiered in 1998, it was the shop\u2019s best-selling tape, and the top rental. Tristan Taormino, the sex educator behind several anal-focused porn flicks, including the \"Expert Guide to Anal Pleasure for Men,\" has noticed that guys are increasingly \"feeling safe enough to explore their fantasies\" in this area.", "Part of this is due to the practice rising to mainstream awareness. In 2001, popular sex columnist Dan Savage held a contest to come up with a slang word to describe the act. The winner was \"peg\" (the runner-up was \"bob,\" as in \"bend over boyfriend\"). It\u2019s a lot easier to talk about when you have a cute verb to describe it. Another major factor is that the stigma of receptive anal play as \"a gay thing\" has been somewhat lessened. I\u2019ve seen defensively heterosexual guys boast about prostate stimulation; these are the kind of guys I\u2019ve actually heard use the irritating I\u2019m-not-gay qualifier \"No homo\" (as in, \"I like your shirt \u2014 no homo\") \u2014 before I wallop them over the head. They haven\u2019t adopted a more fluid understanding of sexual orientation or anything; they\u2019ve just welcomed a new form of stimulation into their definition of acceptable straight sex. As Carol Queen joked, \"I wish I had a nickel for every time I\u2019ve had to explain that it is the gender of the partner rather than the sex act desired that speaks to a person\u2019s sexual orientation.\""], "targetTitle": "Bringing up the rear", "targetDescription": "Sex experts think that more straight men are exploring a formerly taboo hot spot.

I do all the time. Taking risks and going places you aren\u2019t supposed to is a great adrenaline rush. Now, I\u2019m not trying to promote trespassing of any kind. I\u2019m a responsible adult....sometimes. The excitement of the unknown is what drives many people\u2019s curiosity when they decide to finally give urban exploring a try. Maybe you\u2019ll see a ghost, or find an abandoned safe. It\u2019s never the same thing twice though. You really don\u2019t have any idea what you\u2019re going to find or discover. Well that was the driving force behind a man named Dan Bell and his recent decision to explore an abandoned apartment complex. It started out as a simple urban exploration video, but turned into something much more life-threatening in mere moments. Check out the pictures and video he captured, and how this attempt at urban exploration was almost his last.", "He starts out his journey in a small alleyway formed by the abandoned building. This place looks like something out of a horror movie.", "Dan had passed by this scary abandoned apartment for a few weeks, and just couldn\u2019t seem to get it off his mind.", "Dan had found blood and animals parts around different part of the property in a previous shorter visit. He had also found summoning markings around certain parts of the property. As with all great urban explorers however, this only made his curiosity grow with every step.", "He climbed a ladder to reach an upper level of the apartment complex. Inside he found what you would expect to find in an old abandoned building.", "Trash was littered through the maze of rooms and hallways. The paint was peeling off of every single wall, while some walls weren\u2019t even standing anymore. Every step he took was a gamble that the floor would support his weight.", "The remnant of what used to be tenants mail boxes for their apartments. This place definitely fell into serious decay after it was not longer being used.", "Falling debris was a definite worry while walking through this place. It\u2019s so old the wood is rotting and won\u2019t support the weight it used too.", "It became clearer and clearer that people had been in here after the place was abandoned. Apparently \"Tony\" wanted everyone to know he was there at one point.", "Finding a spot to step onto without the threat of a nail in your foot was quite the exercise.", "A tense moment came when Dan took a step, and the ground beneath him literally started to crumble and disintegrate. It\u2019s a tense moment in an already tense video. He was extremely lucky that the floor never caved in on him during his visit.", "After walking through the upper levels for a bit, Dan decides to climb back down the ladder and tackle the ground level floors.

If you watch the whole video, at around the 5:07 mark, you can clearly hear multiple gun shots ringing through the air in the general area. That right there would have probably be enough for me to say it\u2019s time to go. Luckily Dan was able to wait out the crack dealer and his client and make a hasty getaway.

What if China is transitioning too early? That's what HSBC economists Qu Hongbin and Jing Li have posited in a recent note, \"China's new challenge: Faster services expansion, slower productivity growth.\"", "From the note (emphasis added):", "\"Both economic theory and empirical evidence suggest that premature deindustrialisation in developing countries can be damaging. It blocks the main channel of productivity growth, and therefore reduces the economy's potential growth rate and its prospects of catching up with more advanced economies.", "\"Based on the experience of some Latin American countries, a lack of adequate investment and a tendency of specialising according to short-term, rather than long-term, comparative advantage are common mistakes made by developing countries.", "\"This kind of development strategy can result in an underdeveloped industrial sector and slow productivity growth. Given that China's GDP per capita is only 14% that of the US, we believe it is way too early to shift towards services-led growth.\"", "Work, work, work, work, work", "What really worries HSBC is that the service sector's jobs, while in general more labor intensive, are less productive for the economy than jobs in the industrial and manufacturing sectors. The bank's analysts point out that workers in the former are just 80% as productive as those in the latter.", "HSBC", "Arguing against a shift to service-led growth is a super controversial thing because the Chinese government has already made rebalancing a top project \u2014 if not in deed, then certainly in word. The reason for that is simple: debt.", "China has a debt-to-GDP ratio of over 280%. Most of that is concentrated in the industrial and manufacturing sectors. In 2009, when the world was falling apart, the Chinese government decided to just open the money spigots to keep its economy running at full steam.", "That, coupled with a general lack of global demand for materials like steel and coal produced in Chinese factories, has led to overcapacity in those sectors.", "So, to combat that overcapacity, China would like to have fewer people working the jobs where they're making the things that it seems the world has entirely too much of.", "The rest of the world would love that, too. Last week, the US House of Representatives held a hearing on the Chinese economy , \"Evaluating the Financial Risks of China,\" and much of it focused on what that country's economic slowdown has done to the American steel industry.", "During the hearing, Thomas Gibson, president of the American Iron and Steel Institute, pointed out that 33 steel manufacturers have gone bankrupt since the 1990s. He also said that, between 2011 and 2015, the Chinese government claimed that 90 million tons of overcapacity in its steel market had been taken care of. In reality, 300 million tons had been added to China's steel output.", "So what Gibson would like is for China to slow its production and wind the steel industry down.", "The problem with this solution, says HSBC, is that moving away from industry and manufacturing means that China won't grow as fast \u2014 not just in the short term, but also in the long term.", "From the note (emphasis added):", "\"The efficiency loss during such a 'rebalancing' can be huge. Between 2012 and 2015, the total number of migrant workers in the manufacturing sector declined by nearly 7m, compared with an increase of 5m in the three biggest services sectors (ie wholesale and retail, residential services, transportation and logistics). Based on 2015 statistics, each worker in the manufacturing sector generated RMB45,000 more output than their counterpart in the three biggest services sectors. Therefore, if all 5m workers had been employed in the manufacturing sector rather than services, China's total output in 2015 could have been RMB225bn higher, which is around 0.3% of annual GDP.\"", "HSBC suggests that the country makes more targeted and productive investments in the manufacturing and industrial sectors. But, to be honest, the Chinese government hasn't shown that kind of subtlety. Even now, banks continue to lend to unproductive corporations in order to keep workers employed and avoid a hard landing in the short term.", "Meanwhile, the transition to the service sector continues.", "Pretty controversial ideas, no?"], "targetTitle": "China is too quick to rebalance its services sector", "targetDescription": "China has been moving toward fewer coal miners and construction workers in favor of more bankers and shopkeepers.
