Article_Title - five nights at freddy’s sequel delayed for weird reason
Article - five nights at freddy’s creator scott cawthon takes to steam to tease a possible delay for five nights at freddy’s: sister location, the fifth game in the series for the past couple of years, horror gaming fans have been able to look forward to one new entry in the five nights at freddy’s series after another, with four core games, one rpg spinoff, and a novel released so far the next game in the franchise, five nights at freddy’s: sister location, was scheduled to release this coming friday, october 7th, but if developer scott cawthon is to be believed, the project has been delayed by a few months according to a post by cawthon on the five nights at freddy’s: sister location steam page, the game is being delayed because it’s too dark cawthon said that some of the plot elements are so disturbing that they are making him feel sick, and so he is thinking about delaying the game so that he can rework it entirely into something kid-friendly delays happen in the gaming industry all the time, but it’s rare for a game to be delayed mere days before its release five nights at freddy’s fans are confused and angry about this latest development, as many were looking forward to playing the game on friday something else upsetting fans is cawthon’s reasoning that the game is too dark to release, as being dark and disturbing are two characteristics that many consumers look for in a horror game cawthon’s reason for suddenly delaying five nights at freddy’s sister location from its planned october 7th release date doesn’t make much sense a more likely scenario is that this is just a weird publicity stunt meant to hype the game as being so disturbing that its developer almost didn’t even release it alternatively, perhaps cawthon is delaying the game for technical reasons and decided to concoct this story instead of admitting that the fifth core game in the series has issues fans should also consider the possibility that cawthon is just trolling in an attempt to throw them off the scent of an early release cawthon has a habit of surprising fans by releasing five nights at freddy’s games early, and it wouldn’t be all that shocking for five nights at freddy’s: sister location to carry on that tradition, despite cawthon’s post to the contrary with october 7th just a few days away, fans will learn soon enough whether or not cawthon is serious about sister location‘s delay if the game is delayed, it will be interesting to see if cawthon actually does rework it to be more kid-friendly, or if he goes with a slightly altered version of his original vision five nights at freddy’s: sister location is scheduled to launch on october 7th for pc as well as ios and android mobile devices source: scott cawthon

Article - here’s how much you should be tipping your hairdressermore remembering how much you’re supposed to tip anywhere can be hard — what do current trends dictate? is there such a thing as too much? and what if you got a discount on the service? but knowing how much to tip your hairdresser has to be one of the more confusing tip scenarios out there, especially if you get your hair done at a salon where more than one person works on your strands below, once and for all, is a definitive guide to tipping your hairstylist — and their assistant, shampooist, and everyone in between thank us later — no tip necessary if you need a simple baseline, experts agree that tipping 20% is standard and acceptable at any hair salon if you’re in a smaller town, 15% may be the norm you can always ask the receptionist at your salon what’s typical, or ask on the phone when you call to make your appointment offering the person who shampoos your hair $3 to $5 is a nice gesture you can hand the money directly to the shampooist, or give it to the receptionist when you check out and ask them to pass it along as for your stylist’s assistant, that person is likely in training and may not be making much money, so michelle lee, master designer and manager at salon eva michelle in boston, recommends tipping them between $5 and $20 all the assistants are there in training to be stylists, and at many places, a lot are working at minimum wage, so anywhere from $5 to $20 is fine depending on how much they end up doing for the client, or if they have been especially gracious to you, she told instyle try to bring cash to tip, if possible not every credit card machine will allow you to add a tip, and using cash will make it easier to tip the different people who worked on your mane and yes, it’s ok to tip even if your hairdresser is the owner of the salon also, if your salon offers free bang touch-ups, consider bringing a few dollars to leave as a thank-you gesture your stylist will look fondly on you next time you come into the salon if you’re a woman with shorter hair — meaning you get it cut and/or colored regularly — your stylists will understand if you offer a slightly smaller tip after all, your annual bill is much higher than a longer-haired client’s as for tipping on a discounted service: stylists are split on the issue, with some suggesting a 20% tip on the original price of the service, and others saying a tip of 20% on the discounted rate is fine, since the goal is to get you back into the salon when in doubt, ask at the front desk! finally, if you’re unsatisfied with your haircut, communicated what you wanted to your stylist, and talked to them about how to fix it but they refused to make changes, you can definitely lower your tip if they invite you back for a fix-up cut, though, etiquette expert peggy post suggests offering a tip of 15-20%

Article - petapixel is one of my favorite blogs the writers there are passionate and knowledgable about their subject, and love diving into both the art of photography, and the technical gear available for photography also, they just ran a story about a man who swallowed a 64gb microsd card and then pooped it into a strainer so he could maybe recover the drone footage he shot on it the story is written in the first person by john doe, who is apparently embarrassed by the incident and chose to remain anonymous and it’s not really important why or how he swallowed the card, containing the whole day’s worth of drone footage he’d just captured what’s important is that he couldnt puke it back up, and therefore had to poop it into a pasta strainer and then plug it in to a computer to see if the client’s footage was intact look, i don’t want to ruin this whole story for you does john doe get fired? do his colleagues make fun of him forever? do some data recovery experts eventually discover that while the microsd’s controller was broken, the memory was still intact, and everything’s going to be okay john, don’t cry, please don’t cry? yeah but man he pooped a microsd card! i can’t believe it!

Article - most of us are familiar with the pounding headaches, drowsiness, stomach-turning nausea and did-i-get-run-over-by-a-bus sensation that comes with that most dreaded of morning-after ailments: the hangover to alleviate the suffering, chugging coffee, downing advil or simply choosing to forego the wretched day altogether by returning to bed sometimes does the trick but what if there were a miracle elixir that could chase that hangover cloud away -- and better still, what if that magic drink were something you could easily pick up at your local supermarket? a group of chinese researchers say that they may have indeed found this perfect hangover cure -- and it goes by the name of sprite after examining 57 beverages in a lab, researcher hua-bin li and his colleagues at sun yat-sen university in guangzhou determined that sprite was one of the drinks that best relieved hangover symptoms the team of scientists had hypothesized that what you consume after drinking booze could alter the effect of alcohol on your body specifically, they theorized that certain drinks could impact the bodys metabolism of alcohol in a way that would help alleviate hangover symptoms chemistry world explains it this way: some of the adverse effects of alcohol are thought to be caused, not by the ethanol itself, but by ethanol’s first metabolite, acetaldehyde ethanol is metabolized into acetaldehyde by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) and then into acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldh) unlike acetaldehyde, acetate is innocuous and may even be responsible for some of the positive health benefits of alcohol consumption therefore the key to reducing alcohol-related damage lies in minimizing the amount of time acetaldehyde is present in the body the chinese researchers, therefore, decided that they would look at how the different beverages impacted the activity of adh and aldh some beverages were found to be terrible for a hangover an herbal infusion with hemp seeds, for example, was discovered to boost the activity of adh while inhibiting aldh, therefore slowing down the breakdown of acetaldehyde and dragging out the hangover effects on the other hand, some drinks, including sprite (known in china as xue bi) and a type of soda water, were found to have the opposite effect: increasing the activity of aldh and thus speeding up the breakdown of acetaldehyde the researchers are reportedly planning to conduct the tests in living organisms, but the results have already generated a lot of buzz, as people around the world celebrate the possible death of the hangover however, experts warn that we shouldnt quite raise the victory flag just yet edzard ernst, a medicinal science expert from the university of exeter, told chemistry world that while he found the study interesting, more research is necessary before we wholeheartedly embrace the results do you have a tried-and-tested hangover cure that you swear by? tell us below

Article_Title - you won’t believe this stunning ‘harry potter’ revelation about professor mcgonagall
Article - from reading jk rowling‘s harry potter saga, and watching the films, we know a lot about one of our favorite professors and head of gryffindor house, professor minerva mcgonagall stern but fair, mcgonagall expected a lot from her students, but she also cared for them deeply, even if she didn’t always outwardly express it however, what if there was something about professor mcgonagall that we never thought about before? reddit user obversa made a stunning revelation about one of the most bad-ass witches in the entire hp saga obversa suggests that professor mcgonagall was originally hired by dumbledore to teach defense against the dark arts (dada) in 1956 however, not long after, tom riddle (lord voldemort) came back to hogwarts, seeking the dada position for himself dumbledore denied voldemort’s application and as a result, voldemort cast a jinx to prevent any dada professor from ‘lasting more than a year’ dumbledore then transferred mcgonagall to the transfiguration position before the term’s end, to prevent anything bad or dangerous from happening to her after all, as long as she wasn’t teaching dada , the jinx technically wouldn’t apply to her obversa says, prior to being headmaster, dumbledore served as transfiguration professor for several decades, teaching tom riddle himself as a child he was also mcgonagall’s predecessor, under headmaster armando dippet thus, when dumbledore succeeded dippet, he would have left a vacancy for the spot of transfiguration we know that minerva mcgonagall filled this vacancy, but what led her there? as a result of pottermore, we know a bit more about professor mcgonagall’s backstory (which is extremely similar to lord voldermort’s background) mcgonagall was appointed as dumbledore’s assistant in 1956, not as his replacement but why would dumbledore hire a brilliant mcgonagall just as his assistant and not to a full teaching position when she first arrived back at hogwarts? if you recall, one of the reasons why headmaster dippet rejected tom riddle’s application for the dada teaching position, at age 17-18 for tom, was because tom was too young however, dippet encouraged tom to come back a few to several years later to apply again at the time, mcgonagall was still perhaps too young, to be a hogwarts professor in her own right additionally, in harry potter and the order of the phoenix mcgonagall told dolores umbridge that she had been teaching at hogwarts for thirty-nine years this december order of the phoenix takes place in 1995 and 1996, with this statement coming in approximately september 1995 therefore, mcgonagall’s official hiring would have been in the middle of the school year, very odd timing but, why would mcgonagall who is obviously gifted in transfiguration initially apply to be the defense against the dark arts instructor? take note of professor mcgonagall’s wand it’s made of fir with a core of dragon heartstring the wandmaker ollivander once called it the, ‘the survivor’s wand,’ because he had sold it to three wizards who subsequently passed through mortal peril unscathed this means that if the wand chooses the wizard, mcgonagall would have been destined for a lot more than transfiguration it seems likely then that mcgonagall started teaching as dumbledore’s assistant in december of 1956, and, at some point, applied for (and received) the dada job however, lord voldemort arrived to hogwarts shortly thereafter wanting to snag the position for himself once dumbledore refused, voldy put a hex on the position, so mcgonagall had to be transferred to transfiguration after all, the dark lord was probably, angry, vindictive, and jealous of mcgonagall, and wanted to take his revenge for what he saw as what was rightfully his he was also obsessed with the similarities between the amazingly gifted witch just as he was continually obsessed with the similarities between harry potter and himself throughout the entire saga

Article_Title - jj abrams has an answer on if there will be a post-credits scene in the new star wars
Article - in the modern blockbuster world, post-credits scenes have become very popular the films made by marvel studios are arguably best known for it, but fun stingers have also been found in the x-men franchise movies as well as the latest terminator because of this, some have wondered if this could be something new for the star wars series as well but now jj abrams has definitely put an end to that conversation the subject came up when abrams was on stage for a star wars: the force awakens press conference held today in los angeles the filmmaker was directly asked if fans can expect to see a post-credits scene or easter egg at the end of the sequel, and he quickly dismissed the idea, saying: no, there’s not all the scenes are actually in the movie those of you who have been following updates and stories about star wars: the force awakens for a while will note that this dispels a rumor that has been going around for the last few months back in september it was rumored that the latest saga film would actually be teasing the first star wars story, rogue one this made a degree of sense, given that the gareth edwards-directed feature has been filming since this past summer, and will surely have a good amount of footage ready by the time force awakens arrives in theaters now it sounds like that post-credits scene definitely isn’t happening – so instead maybe we can just expect the blockbuster to come with a trailer for the eighth live-action star wars movie during the coming attractions post-credits scenes are definitely fun for fans, and a good incentive to get people to stick around and watch the credits – but i can’t say that i’m too upset that star wars: the force awakens won’t have one after all, they aren’t exactly part of the franchise’s tradition (none of the previous movies have stingers), and it’s not a device that has to be used all over hollywood if everything the movie has to say can be fit between the opening scrawl and the end credits, more power to it surely there will be some fans who will be disappointed by this news, but hopefully they’ll all get over it fairly quickly after all, the feelings about the lack of a post-credits scene should be drowned out by the excitement that comes with the fact that we’re now less than two weeks away from the theatrical release of star wars: the force awakens as always, stay tuned for more about the movie, including our on-camera interviews with the cast and jj abrams!

Article - (cnn) after the first locally transmitted cases of the zika virus were identified in a small area north of downtown miami, officials began to spray an insecticide over a 10-square-mile portion of miami-dade county but what was in the insecticide, and how does it work? the main ingredient of the insecticide, dibrom, is the chemical naled it works by killing mosquitoes on contact sprayers produce very fine droplets that are small enough to stay airborne and intercept mosquitoes in flight naled does not pose a health risk to either people or pets when sprayed in low concentrations, according to both the environmental protection agency (pdf) and the centers for disease control and prevention however, in its own review of naled, the european union came to a different conclusion naled degrades to dichlorvos , a toxic chemical, in the presence of sunlight, and according to the eu scientific commission , this can cause genetic mutations as a result, the eu has banned agricultural use of products containing naled in puerto rico, where a public health emergency has been declared due to the sheer number of cases of zika, recommendations from the cdc and the epa to use aerial spraying to control the mosquito population there have been stymied by protests activists organized a june 28 demonstration outside the san juan cdc and raised concerns about the consequences for human health and their environment by contrast, in miami-dade county, the department of solid waste managements mosquito control section commonly sprays in response to state department of health investigations -- and when residents request the use of insecticide the mosquito control section has applied naled via an ultra-low-volume spray for many years, officials said in a news release in fact, dibrom has been used in the united states over the past 50 years, said timothy j donnelly, vice president, chief administrative officer and general counsel of amvac chemical corp , which makes the insecticide it is regularly sprayed in 12 states on over 15 million acres each year, donnelly said since the variety of mosquito that carries zika is most active predawn and at sunset, all spraying must take place at those times special precautions are not necessary, miami-dade county officials advised, though people with allergies may want to remain indoors during any insecticide operation, it is recommended that beekeepers cover their bees aerial spraying, which lasts about an hour, was recommended by the cdc and floridas department of health to reduce the population of adult mosquitoes, some of which may be capable of spreading viruses, including zika originally scheduled for wednesday, the aerial spraying operation was delayed because of poor weather conditions when naled gets sprayed, it knocks out the mosquitoes, but if sprayed over water, it breaks down quickly, said bryn phillips, a specialist in the university of california, davis environmental toxicology department his research indicates that the insecticide breaks down into different chemical versions of naled one of these versions, dichlorvos, is quite toxic to aquatic species at the low end of the food chain, like aquatic insects and frog larvae -- basically fish food, phillips said if the chemicals are rotated and managed properly, an environmental area can recover, phillips noted naled spray droplets stay airborne for an extended period, and the chemical begins to break down once exposed to sunlight or water very little of the low-concentration spray settles on the ground those who worry that they may have come into contact with the chemicals should wash, county officials advised; any food that may have been exposed should be rinsed before eating since concentrations are far below what is harmful to humans, symptoms, such as skin irritation or headache, are unlikely miami-dade countys aerial spraying alternates between naled and an insecticide called bti (bacillus thuringiensis israelensis, a naturally occurring bacterium), which targets mosquito larvae instead of adult mosquitoes bti has been registered with the epa since 1961 as a pesticide zika was discovered in 1947 in uganda an outbreak that began in brazil in 2015 has spread throughout the americas florida reported the nations first local transmission of zika from an infected mosquito in late july zika has been shown to be responsible for an alarming increase in microcephaly, in which babies are born with small brains and heads, as well as other hearing, vision and developmental disorders although spraying insecticides raises concerns about toxicity to aquatic life, policy-makers must weigh the potential costs to human health by not spraying and costs to environmental health by spraying, phillips said join the conversation see the latest news and share your comments with cnn health on facebook and twitter you talk to the mosquito spraying guys, and theyre all about human health, and theyre ok with some impacts to the environment, he said yet some environmentalists are not ok with any effects to land and sea, he said its a balancing act, phillips said

Article_Title - do birds fart?
Article - have you ever wondered, do birds fart? no? well maybe now we’ve sparked your curiosity they don’t fart—detectably there’s no reason to believe that birds are somehow exempt from passing gas, but it doesn’t seem like anyone has ever truly observed—or more importantly, measured—a bird fart but between ornithologists, veterinarians, and amateur bird watchers, how is it possible no one has ever seen the feathered creatures flatulate? as monterey bay aquarium veterinarian mike murray said in a 2009 article for popular science, birds are capable of passing gas, but they don’t because they lack the same combination of diet and gas-forming bacteria in their gut that gives mammals their odorous gas murray added that if he spotted gas in an x-ray of a bird’s gastrointestinal tract, he’d be concerned something was wrong with the bird but laura eriksen, a birder, educator, and blogger at the cornell lab of ornithology, has a different theory in a blog post on her website, she posits that birds have much shorter digestive tracts than mammals, so there’s less time for gas to build up, allowing farts to slip by undetected in another blog post, she describes the only written account she’s aware of describing a possible bird fart it comes from former cornell student alan richard weisbrod, in his 1965 master’s thesis on blue jays one of the birds in front of me defecated a small puff of whitish gas was expelled along with the feces the feces dropped from the bird while the gas wafted below and parallel to the slightly raised tail, until it dissipated rapidly into the cold air the gas could be clearly seen against the dark-colored eave that hangs over the sheltered perches, upon which the birds were fluffed and resting several days later a bird perched in the same position was observed to defecate with the accompanying wisp of whitish gas weisbrod goes on to describe how birds eat similar diets to many mammals who definitely flatulate but explains that he could not find any other accounts of bird flatulence at that time (and apparently no scientist has stepped up to the plate to follow up on weisbrod’s observation) he also acknowledges that the wisp of whitish gas could also have simply been water vapor—steam rising from the feces (just think of how your dog’s poop steams in the cold when you take him out for his daily business in the winter) it’s a little difficult to know for sure that birds rarely or never fart according to mental_floss, human farts are smelly due to a combination of our diets and the microbes in our guts that help digest the foods in our diets a video by asapscience adds that the longer the food stays in the gut, the more time it has to ferment and break down into its smellier components—namely sulfur so if birds don’t have the right food-microbe combo and intestinal length to produce smelly gas, then we wouldn’t smell it without a smell, bird farts rustle no one’s feathers but even if birds produced immaculate, odorless gas, would we hear it? that is less clear according to a q&a with proctologist lester gottesman in vice, farts make a sound due to the composition of gas and the shape (read: tightness) of the sphincter a lot of the gas that makes up a fart, gottesman said, is swallowed air and a lot of swallowed air leads to a lot of gas, which can make a bigger, beefier noise but how much air does a swallow swallow when a swallow swallows air? as far as we could tell, this isn’t a question any scientist has specifically tried to measure but the daily dot reached out to the cornell lab of ornithology for answers nonetheless according to an ornithologist there, relayed via email by the lab’s good-humored press officer miyoko chu, birds definitely swallow air but he thinks they expel it via burping rather than farting he added that he thinks birds do fart in some cases and would depend on what species, their diet, and whether it is observable he also said that he’s never personally noticed a bird fart lastly, maybe they do swallow enough air that would leave most animals saying excuse me after a butt-bellow, but perhaps something about the construction of the, erm, exit point keeps it from making a sound this is pure speculation, but maybe something about having feathers around the bird’s cloaca (its all-purpose back-end chute) helps the fart slip by unnoticed and without a smell, bird farts rustle no one’s feathers

Article - rolling into the office around 9:30 am every day may be killing your career, even if you stay late to put in a full days worth of work a new study from the university of washington’s foster school of business found that despite working the same amount of time, a worker who starts the day earlier will come off as more conscientious, and consequently receive better performance reviews, than someone who starts later past studies have shown that giving workers a little leeway in setting their hours makes them happier and more productive -- presumably a win for both the employee and the company thats why companies like google and microsoft let employees work from home or adjust their schedules to account for personal responsibilities, like taking a child to school in the morning but the study suggests a downside: your boss may be unconsciously judging you for giving yourself a later start time, regardless of how much work youre getting done in the study, which will be published in full in the journal of applied psychology later this year, researchers asked 149 supervisors to rate an employee’s performance; employee start times ranged from 5 am to 9:45 am even when employees who started later in the day worked the same number of hours as those who started earlier, supervisors were inclined to rate employees who began work earlier as more conscientious, and gave them higher performance ratings bosses who preferred to work later hours themselves were less inclined to display this morning bias in a second experiment, the researchers assigned a group of 141 college students the role of a supervisor, and asked each student to review a profile of a fictitious employee the performance of the fictional employee was the same in all cases, but start time varied across profiles researchers found that employees who worked from 7 am to 3 pm were consistently given higher ratings of conscientiousness and performance by the student supervisors than employees who worked from 11 am to 7 pm the researchers concluded that employees who can opt for flexible work schedules should shift their schedules earlier, not later, to account for managers morning bias it seems likely that some employees are experiencing a decrement in their performance ratings that is not based on anything having to do with their actual performance, the three researchers wrote in a post for the harvard business review this morning bias appears to be deeply ingrained in a word-association experiment designed to test the implicit stereotype that early risers are more diligent workers, the researchers also found that a majority of the 120 working adults surveyed linked words associated with the morning (like sunrise) with words associated with conscientiousness (like industriousness) another recent study covered by the new york times further suggests there may be an implicit view among some managers that employees who take advantage of flexible work policies in any way are less conscientious than employees who work more traditional hours most organizations still treat workplace flexibility as an accommodation, erin kelly, a sociology professor at the university of minnesota, told the times you are implicitly saying, ‘most of us will be working these traditional ways and the rewards will come to those working these traditional ways’ and that is where you have this stigma or career penalties although the study did not consider gender, it seems women could be more adversely affected by morning biases than men thats because more women than men are primary caregivers for their children and assume a disproportionate amount of household tasks, according to a 2013 bureau of labor statistics report studies have shown that women take advantage of workplace telecommuting policies more often than men for the same reason -- and that their careers may suffer as a result of not logging as much face time at the office

and not just any owner: only one of the most powerful owners of all time, lakers owner dr jerry buss and not just any coach: only the most successful nba coach of all time then there were hurdles, such as jeanie buss being the teams vice president in charge of business affairs at the time, and her brother jim buss being in charge of basketball operations so many tangled webs, and yet jeanie buss and jackson somehow made it work for 17 years during the best of times, when the lakers were winning nba championships, theyd ride to the arena together from their house in marina del rey at games, jeanie would sit with her girlfriends linda rambis and stacy kennedy in the second row, across the court from the lakers bench, where phil could see her and the players could hear her once on the drive in, jackson mentioned lamar odom needed a little extra encouragement as he adjusted to his new role as a sixth man so during the game, buss and her girlfriends made a point of cheering for odom as he checked into the game take your pants off! they yelled out, as odom shed his warm-ups near the scorers table he beamed at the attention it was a small thing, but it was those kind of gestures that made the impossible relationship work for so many years the way theyd work in tandem and share thoughts about the team with each other that was camelot once jackson retired as coach in 2011, things started changing at first he was home all the time, plotting his next moves he had no intention of coaching again -- his body couldnt take it and his spirit was leading him in other directions, toward a front-office career, which would allow him to test his principles from on high, way above the court but when dr buss was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2012, and the franchise needed a coach of some stature to come in and lead the team of superstars -- kobe bryant, pau gasol, dwight howard and steve nash -- for what appeared to be dr buss last ride, jackson raised his hand as always, he would do it for jeanie this time, the lakers didnt call on him or rather, general manager mitch kupchak called him around midnight to tell him the lakers had chosen to hire mike dantoni instead jackson was livid his agents issued a blistering statement, decrying the disrespect shown to the coach who had won five titles for la and was willing to come out of retirement to coach the team and help his fiancees family at a critical juncture it did not break apart their relationship though if anything, it strengthened it about six weeks later, jackson proposed to jeanie buss his knees and hips were too stiff to get down on one knee not that he is the grand gesture type, anyway what was important is that he knew getting engaged would make her happy, and give her father some peace as he lay dying the engagement was almost destined to stay at that level once jackson became president of the knicks in 2014 jackson and buss had to sign documents that ensured there would be no conflicts of interest between the two franchises according to sources, that included a provision that the nba and its owners be informed if they ever decided to marry so now not only were they living apart, they couldnt talk about their jobs when they were together if they ever did decide to marry, it would further complicate their business relationships as the years went by, jackson focused in on the knicks and buss focused on the lakers he would come to los angeles when he could, and she would see him in new york when she attended board of governors meetings, but friends say it got harder and harder to find time to connect both of their legacies are tied to what they do next buss must decide whether to reboot the lakers front office jackson needs to make the knicks into a contender those close to jackson say he intends to stay for the full five years of his contract with the knicks, despite the mutual option thats built into his contract this summer there had been speculation that jackson could return to the lakers this offseason, when they might need a new guide in the front office, and he could amicably part from new york those are the types of implausible things that happen in camelot it was never meant to be buss has been spending the past year supervising the development of the teams new practice facility, and working tirelessly on the leagues new collective bargaining agreement she also has maintained close ties with first-year coach luke walton, which is a departure from her distant relationships with previous lakers coaches those close to buss say she also has been giving more thought to the looming question of the teams front office all of those are massive things, that jackson and buss simply couldnt talk about given their current roles so the impossible relationship officially came to a loving end tuesday night camelot was over

jukes said but it was brooks bond with murdoch that served her even after ending up as the type of tabloid fodder that she had once fed on as the chairman and ceo of news corp, murdoch has been one of the most powerful global media figures for decades his affinity for her had been the source of no shortage of reporting in the uk, with some saying that she was like a daughter to him an odd fit even if some people believed that brooks would eventually return to a role at news corp, few expected her to land at storyful but reports on sunday said she would work with or oversee the subsidiary, which provides social media content to major newsrooms around the world storyful launched in 2010 with its headquarters in dublin, ireland founded by journalist mark little, the company sought to tap the emergence of citizen journalism on social media, particularly the posting of pictures and video the company worked to find and verify this kind of content this aggregated media would then be provided to its media partners the startup was quickly seen as being on the cutting edge of digital journalism, particularly the use of social media and crowdsourcing to provide almost real-time coverage of breaking news the company accrued an impressive list of clients, including the bbc, abc and the new york times, which use content found and vetted by storyful (mashable is also a storyful client) news corp bought storyful in december 2013 for $25 million, pledging that the startup would operate as a standalone company storyful had been built in part on a promise of veracity and accountability in a space that had been lacking credibility now, with brooks entering the fold, that promise has begun to ring hollow i feel so sorry for the people i know at @storyful if this is true http://tco/eupjzu5hvw they deserve better — jay rosen (@jayrosen_nyu) march 2, 2015 wait, what?

Article - were just as tired of overly-retouched ads as the next girls, so weve been championing rag & bones diy project since it started back in 2011 as the campaign closes its third year, were thrilled that the latest slew of ads starring julia stegner are as refreshing as ever in case youre not familiar with the concept, the diy project lets models take complete control of the shoot, including the styling and actual photography rag & bone simply gives the chosen model a bag of clothes and a digital camera -- the rest is entirely up to her, including whether or not she wears makeup with julia stegners new shots, the results are fresh, personal and seemingly makeup-free thus far, weve seen gorgeous rag & bone styling interpretations by industry powerhouses like lily aldridge, karolina kurkova, miranda kerr, candice swanepoel and carolyn murphy as for stegner, her beachy shoot features her adorable pup and one of the most effortless haircuts weve seen in a while with more publications swearing off photoshop (verily magazine might just be our favorite) and more brands eschewing makeup in ad campaigns, were happy that a project like this can add to this positive movement in the fashion industry

the number of co-sponsors on jolly’s bill has jumped from six all the way up to — um, eight no senator has come forward with similar legislation jolly, appearing monday morning at the national press club with his lead democratic co-sponsor, rep rick nolan (minn), was not surprised we’ve got six more co-sponsors than i thought we might have, he said it’s a heartbreaking reflection on what the priorities of the congress are    a member’s political survival depends on raising money — that’s the reality jolly speaks the truth lawmakers know what needs to be done to clean up the corrupt system — but nothing happens democrats talk about overturning the supreme court’s citizens united decision allowing corporations and unions to spend unlimited sums on politics but that ultimate fix isn’t happening soon in the house, rep john sarbanes (d-md) has recruited 160 co-sponsors for his system of public financing of elections — another good idea — but so far he has only one republican, gadfly walter jones (nc) republicans remain reflexively opposed to reform, including the idea of disclosure, which senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky) once championed this is why jolly’s idea deserves a look he calls it congressional reform, not campaign-finance reform the goal: to get lawmakers to spend more time lawmaking we’re here three days a week, and half your time is spent raising money, he said in the face of growing crises around the globe, you’ve got a part-time congress this, he said, is a first-rate scandal i’ve argued for other ways to get lawmakers to spend more time working — returning to the five-day week, cutting travel allowances, ending the corrosive practice of members targeting each other for defeat through party committees jolly, now a senate candidate in florida, offers another tack the republican party is predictably opposed the national republican congressional committee, in a letter to cbs after the 60 minutes segment, accused jolly of peddling fiction when he said party officials told him he had to raise $18,000 a day unfortunately, liberals have piled on campaign-finance reformer fred wertheimer told me the idea is not going to solve the problem, because those working for the members could still solicit funds lawrence lessig, a harvard law professor, wrote unfortunately, liberals have piled on campaign-finance reformer fred wertheimer told me the idea is not going to solve the problem, because those working for the members could still solicit funds lawrence lessig, a harvard law professor, wrote a piece in the orlando sentinel calling jolly’s bill a cynical example of fraudulent reform because all that would change is that congressmen wouldn’t have to do the dirty work but while jolly can be accused of election-year gimmickry, he voluntarily refused to solicit contributions for his senate run and though the bill wouldn’t by itself solve the campaign-finance mess, it could help to improve the woeful political culture in other ways jolly’s democratic sidekick, nolan, said that when he first served in congress in the 1970s, lawmakers worked full weeks, giving them time to develop respect for one another and to find common ground if you’ve already consumed 40, 50 hours of the week in travel and fundraising, there’s not a lot of time left over for governing, and we’re seeing the results of that, he said we’re looking at the last couple of sessions of the congress of the united states as being the most unproductive in the history of the country why? well, if everybody’s busy campaigning and raising money, there’s no time for governing the little support jolly has gained for the idea comes largely from florida, home to three of his eight co-sponsors, including democrat alan grayson, also a senate candidate a democratic congressional candidate in florida, businessman randy perkins, went one step further, announcing he would stop soliciting or accepting financial contributions but jolly, a former lobbyist and longtime staffer to the late congressman cw bill young, continues to agitate he said he’s not paying his $400,000 in dues to the nrcc, and he said i don’t buy the notion that he needs more sponsors before house leadership grants a hearing on his bill jolly is a potential ally of democrats on campaign-finance reform, saying that citizens united could be revisited and that we can do better until then, surely more lawmakers on both sides can see the virtue of his cause you think you get elected to represent 700,000 people, he said but you actually got elected to be one more marble on our side of the aisle to keep the majority, and to do that you’ve got to go raise $2 million — and that makes members angry or at least it should

Article - jeff longo was wandering in the intense florida heat when he saw a tiny ball of fluff on the sidewalk what’s more, then and there, despite having no experience of rearing animals, he vowed to nurse the poor baby back to health this took place in 2013 on the sizzling streets of tampa longo, a florida native, thought that the little thing didn’t look good, and he knew that the unrelenting sunshine was taking its toll indeed, longo later recounted how the helpless baby was half-dead when they first met and so, despite having no clue even as to what the animal was, he decided to take it back to his home in st petersburg consequently, longo christened the critter biscuits and began to hand-rear her himself clearly, then, the first order of the day was to give the adorable and tiny creature, which was just over an inch in length, some major tlc however, without an inkling of even which species biscuits belonged to, longo didn’t have the first idea about how best to raise her so, this being the 21st century and all, he began to research his new-found friend online first, longo went to reddit to ask the website’s online community for help however, most of the responses were from people telling him, simply, that there was no way he’d manage to raise biscuits on his own undeterred, though, longo continued his research and eventually discovered the answer he was looking for it turned out that he was going to be looking after a southern flying squirrel naturally, this species of squirrel usually resides in forests and woods, using trees as their habitat they furthermore survive on a diet of nuts, seeds, fruit and insects as well as eggs and birds the gliding rodents are nocturnal, and young squirrels tend to stay with their mothers until they are at least two months old since biscuits had somehow become separated from her family, then, it was now down to longo to fill her mother’s shoes so, for two months, longo took biscuits everywhere with him – even to work he even bottle-fed her with a mix of puppy formula and heavy cream as each day passed, biscuits grew bigger and stronger, until she eventually became a healthy adult squirrel in addition to getting the gift of life, though, biscuits had also, again thanks to her encounter with longo, gained a new family indeed, alongside her surrogate mother, biscuits gained some four-legged family friends – in the shape of longo’s dogs that said, given their difference in stature, longo admitted that he had to watch them so they don’t accidentally squish her

Article_Title - i was really bad at sports in high school this study helps me understand why
Article - i was a horrible lacrosse player in high school: bad at catching the ball, slow, and not very aggressive yet id spend hours at a handball wall with my stick: throwing, catching, repeating i played on winter leagues, and woke up early for 6 am pickup games freshman and sophomore years, i made it onto the junior varsity team — a miracle by 11th grade, it was time to try out for varsity lacrosse this is when my history teacher — the varsity coach — pulled me aside and suggested i shouldnt bother id probably be cut, he said (adding that i was getting very good grades) for me, practice did not make perfect lo and behold, i now have scientific validation a meta-analysis in perspectives in psychological science looked at 33 studies on the relationship between deliberate practice and athletic achievement and found that practice just doesnt matter that much more precisely, the analysis found, practice can account for 18 percent of the difference in athletic success put another way, if we compare batting averages between two baseball players, the amount of time the players spent in the batting cage would only account for 18 percent of the reason one players average is better than the other even more simply: some people are just better at sports than others, and the difference cannot be made up by practice alone there was a reason i lagged behind my peers on the lacrosse field they probably had a natural advantage on me one important thing — thats easy to misunderstand— is that this is looking at variance across people, not within an individual, brooke macnamara, the lead author of the perspectives paper, tells me so if a person practices, they will get better almost across the board, practice should improve one’s performance but it also means that for the same amount of practice, some will end up being better at sports than others essentially, learning rates vary, macnamara says some people improve very quickly with less practice, while others require much more practice the analysis found this 18 percent figure is roughly true no matter what type of sport is being played practice accounts for the same difference in performance in bowling as it does field hockey, two completely different activities practice also explains fewer differences in ability the further an athlete ascends into higher levels of play which suggests deliberate practice loses its predictive power beyond a certain level of skill, the study reports the analysis also found that the age when athletes started their sports didnt change this figure much either so what, then, explains the remaining 82 percent? heres where we should note a limitation of studying practice: researchers typically ask athletes to recall their schedules and practice hours, and memories can be faulty but macnamara doesnt think better measurements of practice would make that 18 percent figure leap up to near 100 there’s probably not one huge contributor that’s accounting for everything else, she says instead, theres likely a whole constellation of factors — some of which are genetic or biological in nature — that explain why some people are better athletes than others they include: personality and perseverance propensity to get injured propensity to choke under pressure individual differences in maximum oxygen uptake differences in how we acquire muscle mass coordination height enjoyment of competition we have so many factors within a person that can contribute to [athletic performance] — different genes, different cognitive abilities, different physical attributes, she says all of those things are important and interact with each other which is why it is so hard to pin down what predicts performance overall, she says the finding is a strike against the popular 10,000 hour rule, which implies anyone can become master at an activity if they were to just devote the time to it the research in sports, and in other activities such as music, games, and education, just doesnt back that hypothesis up on the other hand, its not like these findings are an excuse not to try eighteen percent is big, macnamara says were trying to argue against these ideas that its so important it accounts for nearly everything practice matters, but its unlikely to bridge the gap between inborn superstars and your average, or perhaps clumsy, kid for the athletically un-inclined, like myself, its a bit of a relief its okay if you cant make up the difference with practice, or if youre just a slow learner when it comes to sports its also okay to just enjoy being on a team, trying hard but knowing youll unlikely be the best growing up, my dad was on a quest to find my sport — the activity id finally master lacrosse was the closest we came but it was mostly a parade of failures baseball: throw a ball at me and ill be more likely to bruise than catch it soccer: i was much too slow basketball: all of the above tennis: i was cut from the middle school team im not a well-coordinated person, and thats just fine these days i stick to activities that dont involve hand-eye coordination: hiking, biking, running, skiing i love physical activity lifes just too short to spend it on activities youre horrible at

Article_Title - true detective season two: how big is justin biebers penis?
Article - a single question now plagues the minds of all americans, weighing down our brains as we slump in our office chairs, then slump in our cars, then slump in our couches, and then slump into bed: how big is justin biebers penis really? the swaggy lil pop star and his cavalry of minders would have us believe that justin bieber has a huge dick last week, calvin klein released photos of bieber modeling their underwear for a new ad campaign one memorable shot showed off the singers protruding package in arresting profile shortly after the photos hit the internet, a web site called breathe heavy posted what it claimed was the same image prior to re-touching if that claim were accurate, it would mean that calvin klein (well, not him personally, although maybe) had stuffed biebers stocking nearly to bursting here are the two images side-by-side: biebers team immediately insisted that breathe heavys photo was fake, and requested the web site take it down breathe heavy complied, originally replacing the photos with an editors note, but eventually removing the entire post altogether in that since-deleted note, breathe heavys editor seems to accept biebers explanation at gunpoint bieber denies the photo is real, and i respect that and will believe him the question, therefore, is: are the claims of the bieber camp correct, and the photo fake? or did breathe heavy have the real photo, and capitulate in the face of legal intimidation? (its easy to make a case that breathe heavys photos are the real deal: we know that at least one photo was significantly retouched prior to publication, as biebers camp did not dispute an earlier tmz story alleging that calvin klein sculpted biebers pecs, filled out his abs and bestowed him pubes in this ad from the campaign; furthermore, virtually every celebrity photoshoot in america gets touched up at some point why would biebers dick be a grand outlier?) but in many ways this dispute is just a lead-in to an essential american question: what exactly is bieber packing? lets be true detectives this is a screencap taken from a video of the calvin klein shoot that bieber himself posted to instagram here we have a direct, unaltered view of his package and can plainly see that it looks quite different than the massive knot he is sporting in the photo advertisement front-bulge will almost always look less impressive than side-bluge, granted, and this is a fine bulge, certainly, but one that seems far off of calvin kleins idealized burmese python last september, bieber appeared onstage at the fashion rocks concert for some reason he stripped down to his underwear, which produced a number of generally alarming photos such as this one there are a number of things we can glean from this photo one is that justin bieber has muscles look at the strong boy! another is that his happy trail does indeed appear to stop abruptly right about where it does in the pre-photoshop version of the calvin klein shot in which a model gropes him but because bieber wore jet black briefs that reveal no hint of bulge, this photo doesnt help us understand how big his dick actually is for that, we must consult more candid shots in 2013, bieber went to hawaii and jumped off a cliff after exiting the water, he was photographed walking on the beach, resulting in the image you see here: this is perhaps the most revealing shot of biebers bulge in the wild does it look exceedingly large? id say not in fact, it looks like any mans normal penis of course, it should be noted that its unfair to judge a dick by what it looks like immediately after being submerged in the sea however we can only work with the materials we have next we will consult a tumblr called justin biebers bulge, a blog dedicated to justin biebers glorious, wonderful bulge, which is not run by me for a tumblr devoted to one mans dick, its a pretty boring blog, but there is one compelling photo here is a fan shot of justin bieber in concert, his leather drop-crotch pants dropped well below his crotch we can see a hint of bulge, and from this angle it does not look like justin bieber is trying to smuggle a butternut squash through airport security, as calvin klein might want us to believe that is evidence supporting the theory that justin bieber is adequately endowed arguing in favor of justin biebers alleged big dick are two people: tati neves, a brazilian model, and biebers trainer patrick nilsson these two claim to have seen biebers flesh in the flesh, and if were to believe them, calvin klein has staked its reputation on the right massive dong neves claims to have slept with bieber during his infamous brazilian sex romp here is what she told a british tabloid about biebers d: speaking to the sun, brazilian model tati nevas said: take it from me, hes well endowed - and very good in bed nilsson, meanwhile, was shuttled out to do damage control in the wake of the calvin klein photoshop controversy here, according to breathe heavy, is his assessment: and to make up it, heres a new quote from justins trainer patrick nilsson, who says jb is packing i can definitely confirm that he is a well-endowed guy i sound weird saying that, but yes indeed you do two people claim to have personal connections with justin biebers dick and claim it is large, but one is on justin biebers payroll while we will consider their opinions, the overwhelming visual evidence suggests that justin biebers penis is perfectly average—large enough to adequately fill out a pair of briefs, but not so large that it could arouse envy and terror when plastered across sprawling billboards, or choke a cow, without enhancement in this case, it appears, justin bieber is the same as any man still, we dont know for sure, and here is where we turn to you, our readers: have you ever had sex with justin bieber? have you ever seen his dick? do you know someone who has? are you scooter braun? lets settle this debate once and for all email me at jordan@gawkercom or leave a comment below

Article - we were always thinking there would be more contagious cancer out there, but we didn’t know where they would be discovered, said elizabeth p murchison, a cancer biologist at the university of cambridge who was not involved in the new study in the traditional view of cancer, mutations strike a cell these mutations have several causes, including toxins and viruses however they arise, they drive a cell to multiply uncontrollably until the cancer is wiped out by the immune system or kills its victim either way, the cancer stays inside the body where it started a decade ago, scientists discovered two exceptions in the 1990s tasmanian devils in australia began developing deadly face tumors but dna in the tumor cells did not match that of the affected animals, studies showed tasmanian facial tumor disease, as it was eventually called, appears to have had its start in a single tasmanian devil that lived in the 1980s transmitted by bites, the cancer spread to other tasmanian devils and acquired mutations along the way that helped make it even more infectious a second strain of the cancer was identified last year dogs, too, can get a type of contagious cancer called canine transmissible venereal tumor, which jumps from host to host during sex the tumor usually disappears in a few months, however scientists have determined that the cancer originated in dogs 11,000 years ago for years, tasmanian devils and dogs were the only species known to contract contagious cancer but last year, stephen p goff, a molecular biologist at columbia university, and his colleagues found contagious cancer in soft-shell clams from new york to prince edward island, these clams have suffered from aggressive tumors since the 1970s carol reinisch, a marine biologist at environment canada, found that the cancer clustered in populations, as if it was caused by an outbreak of some sort she suspected a cancer-causing virus moving from host to host for help, dr reinisch turned to dr goff the two researchers found no evidence of a virus in the soft-shell clams but they did discover that dna in the tumor cells carried a genetic sequence not found in healthy cells in the clams after examining the dna, they confirmed that the cancer cells in different clams all came from a single common ancestor somehow, this cancer has been spreading from clam to clam up the coast, dr goff said he and his colleagues began to wonder if other species of clams or related animals — known collectively as bivalves — had contagious cancers of their own, and, if so, why they chose to study cancers in mussels, cockles and golden carpet shell clams in every case, the researchers reported in the journal nature, the cancers in the animals were contagious we are now at four for four, dr goff said as it turned out, the cancer in cockles comprises two separate strains even stranger, the cancer cells in the golden carpet shell clams did not develop from the species’s own cells instead, the scientists matched the cancer’s dna to pullet shell clams, which live in the same intertidal beds off the coast of spain but dr goff and his colleagues could not locate any pullet shell clams with this disease they concluded that this strain of contagious cancer must have started in pullet shell clams and then jumped species, infecting golden carpet shell clams it killed all the vulnerable pullet shell clams, leaving only resistant ones behind that’s really quite incredible, dr murchison said, noting that scientists had tried without success to infect foxes and other dog relatives with canine cancer the new study, she said, shows that contagious cancer can indeed cross the species barrier with eight contagious cancers now on the books, dr murchison has started to wonder if they are not as peculiar as previously thought they might be emerging fairly often, she said so should people worry about an outbreak of infectious cancer? i don’t think we should be starting to panic, dr murchison said there have been rare reports of people transmitting cancer an estimated 004 percent of organ transplant recipients contract cancer from the donor organ, for example but in these cases, the cancer does not spread like a true parasite from host to host yet it’s not inconceivable that a human cancer might gain that power in 1965, scientists put mosquitoes in a cage with hamsters, one of which had cancer the mosquito carried the cancer cells to the healthy hamsters the new research does raise the possibility that these types of diseases could arise in humans, dr murchison said dr goff and his colleagues are now trying to turn the contagious cancer in shellfish into a model for human cancers they hope to find clues to metastasis, the way cancer spreads through the body the evolution of a contagious cancer in some ways may mirror the evolution of a single tumor in the body in shellfish, dr murchison said, we can see the effect of evolution on their genomes in a more pronounced way

Article_Title - syria conflict indicates armageddon, say one third of americans (survey)
Article - most things arent really the end of the world, but one-third of americans who were surveyed believe that the syria conflict is an indication that our days are numbered a biblical passage which prophesies the destruction of damascus and links it to the coming of armageddon is leading many people to think that the current violence is an apocalyptic omen a lifeway research poll asked 1,001 people if they agreed with the statement, i believe the battles in syria are all part of the prophecies of the book of revelation, and 32 percent of them said yes twenty-six percent agreed with the assertion that us military intervention in syria might lead to the battle of armageddon that’s spoken about in the book of revelation gender played a role in responses, as women were more likely than men to draw a corollary between biblical prophecy and the current situation in syria location and income also skewed the results, with southerners and members of households making less than $25,000 per year being much more likely to connect syria with the end of days in addition, one in five people polled agreed with the statement, i believe the world will end in my lifetime the rev mark hitchcock of faith bible church in edmond, okla, speculates that people looking for answers in tough economic and political times want to know that god is in charge they want to know that someone has his hands on the wheel, according to lifeway though he believes the bible does predict future events in the middle east, the author of the end: a complete overview of bible prophecy and the end of days said that he does not think the trouble in syria was predicted in the bible isaiah 17:1 is one of the passages most frequently referenced when relating syria to the end of the world it states: the burden of damascus behold, damascus is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap (king james version) ed stetzer, president of lifeway research, was surprised by the results of the survey he said that previous us military actions like the war in afghanistan or 1990s air strikes on bosnia didnt get the same reaction however, syrias shared border with israel, as well as the explicit biblical mention of damascus, may account for the significant number of affirmative responses stetzer said that he could see why attaching biblical significance to the syria conflict would appeal to many christians, because, for christians, the end of the world doesn’t mean despair the end is really a new beginning

Article - when examining the benefits of a drug that extends life expectancy, it’s not enough to look at how many years are being added on, but the quality of the years being added researchers at the university of washington’s dog aging project are quick to point that out when they talk about their hopes for rapamycin the drug, also known as sirolimus, was originally developed and prescribed to prevent rejection of transplanted organs in humans, and also to fight cancer however, in low doses, rapamycin was shown to slow aging processes and increase the lifespan of mice the drug is currently being tested on 32 middle-aged dogs (6-9 years old) for its affects on both increase canine longevity and dogs’ overall health the trial will last up to six months, after which, the dogs will continue to be monitored to hopefully determine an increase in life expectancy geneticist daniel promislow told the telegraph: if rapamycin has a similar effect in dogs – and it’s important to keep in mind we don’t know this yet – then a typical large dog could live two to three years longer, and a smaller dog might live four years longer a longer trial is underway to determine how extended treatments with rapamycin affect the longevity in dogs after the results that have been seen in the mice study, the researchers believe that they could see a dog’s life extended by up to five years by making them more impervious to health issues such as cancer, kidney failure, and dementia not only would it increase the length of dogs’ overall lives, but it would compound that by increasing their number of good years promislow remains optimistic on both fronts, saying, if we can understand how to improve the quality and length of life, it’s good for our pets and good for us it’s win-win

Article - a second catholic university in california this week has dropped elective abortion coverage for its staff in a letter dated oct 3, santa clara university president michael engh announced the 2014 change to the jesuit universitys 1,600 employees our core commitments as a catholic university are incompatible with the inclusion of elective abortion coverage in the universitys health plans, engh wrote in the letter the move appears to be part of a trend among catholic campuses seeking to uphold their religious beliefs while employing and enrolling many non-catholics, the los angeles times notes just this week, loyola marymount university, a catholic university in los angeles, also announced that it will eliminate elective abortion coverage for its staff starting next year the move by both universities was met with outrage by some of its staff, who thought there should have been more dialogue before a decision was made the policy comes as quite a shock, nancy unger, a history professor at santa clara, said to nbc there was no discussion there was a request for discussion afterwards, which many of us felt was really sort of patronizing president obamas affordable care act requires that birth control be covered but allows employers to restrict abortion coverage health plans must cover birth control under the affordable care act, but obamacare allows employers to offer plans that restrict abortion coverage father jim bretzke, a professor of moral theology at boston college, sympathized with santa claras decision an elective abortion is a serious moral evil, and if it’s in our power to end that on whatever level we can operate, we should do our best to end that moral evil, bretzke said to cbs they believe that that is a moral evil and so they’re pursuing dropping that from their packages the change by the universities moves in the opposite direction of californias abortion law just this week, gov jerry brown, himself a former jesuit seminarian, signed a bill allowing nurses and midwives to perform abortions

Article - this fall, protests at yale, princeton, duke and the university of missouri — where the chancellor and system president resigned in the midst of turmoil — drew national attention to the concerns many students have about how minorities are treated on campus the protests have also prompted debate about freedom of speech and whether students should be protected from words and ideas that make them uncomfortable everett piper, president of oklahoma wesleyan university, weighed in with a letter to the campus community: this past week, i actually had a student come forward after a university chapel service and complain because he felt victimized by a sermon on the topic of 1 corinthians 13 it appears that this young scholar felt offended because a homily on love made him feel bad for not showing love! in his mind, the speaker was wrong for making him, and his peers, feel uncomfortable i’m not making this up our culture has actually taught our kids to be this self-absorbed and narcissistic! any time their feelings are hurt, they are the victims! anyone who dares challenge them and, thus, makes them feel bad about themselves, is a hater, a bigot, an oppressor, and a victimizer i have a message for this young man and all others who care to listen that feeling of discomfort you have after listening to a sermon is called a conscience! an altar call is supposed to make you feel bad! it is supposed to make you feel guilty! the goal of many a good sermon is to get you to confess your sins — not coddle you in your selfishness the primary objective of the church and the christian faith is your confession, not your self-actualization! so here’s my advice: if you want the chaplain to tell you you’re a victim rather than tell you that you need virtue, this may not be the university you’re looking for if you want to complain about a sermon that makes you feel less than loving for not showing love, this might be the wrong place if you’re more interested in playing the hater card than you are in confessing your own hate; if you want to arrogantly lecture, rather than humbly learn; if you don’t want to feel guilt in your soul when you are guilty of sin; if you want to be enabled rather than confronted, there are many universities across the land (in missouri and elsewhere) that will give you exactly what you want, but oklahoma wesleyan isn’t one of them at okwu, we teach you to be selfless rather than self-centered we are more interested in you practicing personal forgiveness than political revenge we want you to model interpersonal reconciliation rather than foment personal conflict we believe the content of your character is more important than the color of your skin we don’t believe that you have been victimized every time you feel guilty and we don’t issue trigger warnings before altar calls oklahoma wesleyan is not a safe place, but rather, a place to learn: to learn that life isn’t about you, but about others; that the bad feeling you have while listening to a sermon is called guilt; that the way to address it is to repent of everything that’s wrong with you rather than blame others for everything that’s wrong with them this is a place where you will quickly learn that you need to grow up! this is not a day care this is a university!

Article - they have a reputation for nodding off afterwards – and now it seems making love can make some men depressed, too in fact, they can become so sad and emotional that they suffer ‘post-coital dysphoria’ (pcd), according to a report until now it was assumed only women suffer pcd, with nearly half reporting feelings of sadness, anxiety and tearfulness at some point  but in recent years doctors have heard complaints from male patients that they can go into deep depression and feel achy and irritable for hours after sex the report’s author, professor robert schweitzer, of queensland university of technology in australia, has studied data from both genders, and says pcd is ‘not uncommon’ in men he said: ‘there are a wide range of responses in the period of time immediately following sexual activity, known as the resolution phase  some people like to cuddle, others like to be alone and there are others who experience what is described as post-sex blues’ psychotherapist and sex therapist phillip hodson, author of how to make great love to a man, said: ‘the sadness some men feel at this point may be due to the contrast between the joy of arousal and feeling like a superhero and the sensation of the feel-good hormones wearing off’ and while women have a reputation for becoming emotional after sex, he added: ‘i think men get emotional too, but they don’t show it’

Article - i felt kind of icky to be benefiting from this fight, ms lepucki said at the same time, the opportunity to reach readers is a fantasy i did still wonder whether anyone would care, she added oh, they care california, which arrives on tuesday, is now one of the most preordered debut titles in hachette history, according to a company spokeswoman ms lepucki’s agent is negotiating rights with the producer gregg fienberg and killer films little, brown and company, the hachette division behind california, has increased the initial print order and doubled the length of her author tour ms lepucki found herself in portland, ore, this week to sign 10,000 copies of her novel for the independent superstore powell’s books, where california hit no 1 on the best-seller list after mr colbert directed viewers there occasionally, my brain would overheat, and i’d forget how to write, she said of her signing session my signature is like a squished spider how ms lepucki ended up as perhaps the only author to benefit from the amazon-hachette spat over pricing is a tale of almost unbelievable luck and it has a twist: her husband, patrick brown, is employed, in a sense, by amazon he works for goodreads, a social network and peer recommendation engine for books; amazon acquired it last year amazon has historically been a bully, and i don’t shop there, ms lepucki said but i love goodreads for the record and my marriage mr colbert’s promotion of california started with sherman alexie, an anti-amazonian and national book award winner for the absolutely true diary of a part-time indian mr colbert invited mr alexie on his show and asked him to bring a book by an author penalized by amazon’s refusal to take hachette preorders mr alexie said that he asked hachette for a few advance copies of books by debut authors to peruse california was on the top of the stack i honestly suspected it wasn’t going to be my kind of book — too earnest, mr alexie said in a telephone interview but i started reading it, and it turned out to be an earnest page turner with its post-apocalyptic setting, california mines a very busy vein in contemporary fiction but ms lepucki sees it as a love story a young couple, frida and cal, have fled the ruins of los angeles to make a home in the wilderness everything changes when frida becomes pregnant, and they leave isolation for a strange settlement filled with threats it seems impossible that a story with such dark undercurrents could spring from someone so laid-back and gregarious over breakfast in los angeles, where she grew up, the freckled ms lepucki displayed a surferish vibe, right down to the wet blond hair that she twisted to the side as she spoke still, her eyes, which are a striking shade of blue, had a tendency to flash mischievously i have a darker imagination than most people, she said if you don’t ponder the end of the world on a regular basis, i don’t think you’re really human ms lepucki winced when asked if the couple in california is modeled on her and her husband it’s an easy guess to make, especially since she became pregnant with their 3-year-old son, dixon bean, while writing but no i’m madly in love with my husband, but it’s not us, she said people seem to hate frida, so i hope i’m not her (her mother-in-law’s response to the book: i’m sad she killed me in a blizzard) ms lepucki is a graduate of oberlin college and the university of iowa writers’ workshop, and is the founder and director of writing workshops los angeles, which has drawn 1,300 participants since it began in 2008 she is also known in book circles as a writer for the millions, a highbrow literary website california is actually her second novel but the first, a disturbing story about teenage girls that her agent, erin hosier, called the novel equivalent of a harmony korine movie, failed to sell to a publisher it was overly ambitious, ms hosier said we finally stopped trying to sell it, because the rejection became too embarrassing and painful that put more pressure on california you really can’t fail twice in a row if you have her credentials, ms hosier said even before the boost from mr colbert, california was receiving praise from respected novelists like jennifer egan and ben fountain and popping up on summer reading lists little, brown ultimately printed 60,000 hardcovers but insta-fame feels more than a little weird, and she confessed to feeling awkward about the experience of being interviewed she had another confession to make, too: yes, she shuns amazon, but just to be honest she did once buy a tin of bag balm, a salve first developed to soothe cow udders i had a chapped elbow, she explained

Article_Title - this nfl player slept in a utility closet in college to save money
Article - green bay packers punter tim masthay was obsessed with saving money before he even had any so much so that he slept in a utility closet in college because it reduced his rent to only $100 a month tim and his wife amanda recently attended the nfl’s personal finance camp, which educates players on how to make their money last long after they stop playing personal finance acumen is important for everyone it doesn’t matter if you’re a high income or a low income earner or somewhere in between if you’re old or young or single or married it’s important for everyone you would think one of the professors leading the classes at the camp said this, but tim did, after being asked why he attended spouses of players were invited to the event, which was held between april 4 and april 7 in fort lauderdale, fla meet the nfl player who lived in a utility closet in college to save money (1:31) tim masthay, of the green bay packers, and his wife amanda are the best team in the nfl when it comes to personal finance when we asked the masthays what they did with his first big nfl paycheck, they said a big chunk went toward the league’s 401(k) plan and another went into an education fund for their young children and when asked if he ever had to switch financial advisers like many athletes do because they’re not happy with the advice or returns they’re getting, tim said he’s never had one he invests his money himself in low-cost index funds and if you’re wondering how many credit cards they have they have one also see: what it’s like to take a finance class with a lot of nfl players tim, 29, met his wife amanda while they were sophomores at the university of kentucky they married soon after graduating and have two children and a third on the way they’re clearly a great team, but what made them so smart about money? here’s what they shared with us what it’s like to make so much money while you’re in your 20s tim wasn’t drafted out of college but was signed — and released — by the indianapolis colts before the 2009 season started he later signed with the green bay packers and has had great success with them he signed a five-year, $6 million contract in 2012 that included a $12 million signing bonus and he won a super bowl with the packers in 2011 i almost fell on the floor when i saw his first paycheck amanda masthay while tim was trying to make an nfl roster, amanda was working as a bank teller making $9 an hour that was all the money we had so we went from getting by to the first paycheck that he got i almost fell on the floor when i saw it i had never seen that much money in my life, amanda said they were tempted to buy things when they got the check it took a lot of restraint and we sort of had to wrap our heads around it so that we didn’t buy some car that we really couldn’t afford, she said tim says that first paycheck was for $9,000, and that while it was a lot of money to him, too, it was at the league minimum there was this influx of money at a young age where we were accustomed to being on scholarship, but it wasn’t quite as traumatic as what some players who are top draft picks experience the unique financial challenges of being an nfl player — and the wife of a player when you start making a lot of money in the league, you have to figure out what to do with it, tim said how do i spend it? how do i save it? how do i budget? how am i going to play? because it’s very difficult to project how much you’re going to earn in an nfl career it might be a one-year career, and it might be a five-year career how the nfl keeps its players from going broke (1:58) see what its like to attend the nfls personal finance camp, which trains players on how to make their money last long after they stop playing he said another challenge is that they’re only paid during the season, except for a small off-season stipend we receive eight or nine paychecks throughout the year and you’ve got to do all of your budgeting and saving based off of those checks it’s a little different way of being paid than i think most people are, tim said but he also acknowledged that if you have some vision for the future, it’s a fantastic opportunity in terms of investment how they got so smart about money the masthays said their educations at the university at kentucky — he was an economics major and she was a marketing major — were helpful, and that lessons they learned at a young age were also influential if we ever went on vacation as kids, i remember being 6 or 7 and my mom would give me a check register and i would do chores around the house and go wash people’s cars and save up for my spending money, amanda said tim said that at kentucky’s business school he took a class in his sophomore year — in which he met amanda, incidentally — and the professor said if you can save $10,000 when you’re 20 years old and if the stock market were to return what it’s historically returned, you’d have $1 million when you were 60 i remember thinking, wow that’s interesting, he said that made him think of ways he could save some of his scholarship money, which was $750 a month one way he did that was to live in a utility closet for $100 a month in a house that four of his friends lived in he said it was just big enough to fit a bed by the time i graduated i had saved $10,000 while living on a scholarship check that’s what i bought her wedding ring with, he said (he spent part of it on the ring) tom szczerbowski/getty images tim masthay punting in a game against the buffalo bills on dec 14, 2014 one mistake? tim said one area they could have been smarter in is real estate they bought a house in kentucky for the off-season while also owning a home in green bay they’ve since sold the kentucky home but say they didn’t like owning a home they only used for part of the year marriage and money amanda said one of the reasons she was interested in attending the personal finance camp was to see what they could do to minimize financial stress during the season finance is one of the biggest elements of stress for most people, so if there’s something we can do that’s going to make something else a little bit easier, then why wouldn’t we want to learn about that and try to implement it in our lives? during the interview, amanda and tim were in agreement on most things and at times finished each other’s sentences when we asked tim what he thought helped him go from being waived by the colts in 2009 to setting records with the packers in 2011, amanda said: he married me

Article - a group of conservative tennessee lawmakers plan to punish the states flagship public university over a student-organized event in early march called sex week -- by dramatically cutting back its ability to host guest speakers state lawmakers are moving forward this week with a vote on legislation that would bar the university of tennessee (ut) and other public institutions of higher education from using institutional revenue to engage and pay visiting or guest speakers for events even commencement speakers who asked the school to cover travel and lodging costs or who sought a speaker fee would be eliminated (the legislation would not prevent the hiring of guest faculty to conduct classes for which students receive credit) another bill would require state colleges to distribute student fees to pay for guest speakers proportionally based on membership of the student groups inviting the speaker both of these bills were authored by state sen stacey campfield (r-knoxville) and were scheduled for their first committee vote on wednesday they are being pushed in response to sex week, a week-long student-organized and student-funded event at uts knoxville campus discussing sexuality, lgbt issues, sexual health and related topics campfield previously gained national recognition -- and stirred national controversy -- in 2012 for his dont say gay bill, which would have prevented schoolteachers from discussing homosexuality the legislation ultimately did not pass that year or when it was resurrected in 2013 last week, two other state senators -- education committee chairwoman dolores gresham (r-somerville) and government operations committee chairman mike bell (r-riceville) -- issued a letter to university leaders warning that state funding for the university may be in jeopardy, even though no taxpayer funds went toward sex week gov bill haslam (r) has not said whether he would sign the bills into law university leaders have repeatedly explained to lawmakers that they could not block sex week because the first amendment protects college students right to speak, and legal experts have backed them up bell and gresham argued in their letter that the university could have shut down the event on the grounds that it was obscene but ut system president joe dipietro told the chattanooga times free press that the university did not have any indication from anybody that theres an obscenity situation at all in this program attendance at sex week increased this year, according to the schools daily beacon sex week organizers told huffpost that there have been no protests against it on campus, while an ut administrator said in february that the university had received no calls of complaint from local community members or alumni nonetheless, the tennessee state house has already passed a resolution condemning the students who organized sex week, which the house called an atrocious event on monday, a petition opposing campfields bills, signed by 3,500 students, was presented at the statehouse in addition, 650 student letters were sent to lawmakers friday a ut-knoxville graduate student provided the huffington post with a form email she received from campfield in response to her objections to his legislation the lawmaker said: while i support diversity of thought at the university, what is currently in place is not diversity sadly, when you look at a list of the paid speakers for the university the vast majority are from one point of view and balancing points of view are minimized ut administration and faculty leaders, who firmly oppose both bills, agree with campfield on that one point -- that a university should be a place where many voices are heard if people realize were an institution that doesnt allow outside speakers, i think that could have a significant impact, ut faculty senate president david golden told the tv station wate i can think of no better place for contradictory, conflicting, controversial ideas to be presented than on a university campus

Article - photo credit: pixabaycom looking at the star signs from a scientific standpoint a hospital in argentina is reportedly using astrology to help treat some mental health conditions, like depression and anxiety, by giving patients an understanding of their astrological personalities the guidance is given based on the patient’s sign — whether he or she is an aries, taurus, or so forth — and the leading astrologist develops a star chart for each patient unsurprisingly, the astrology workshop is being met with criticism over its scientific validity diego andrés golombek, a professor at the university of quilmes in argentina, told quartz, astrology can be harmless, of course, unless it gives directions and instructions into how to proceed with, for example, an illness or medical treatment see also: 6 questions to ask before sharing science on the internet and, indeed, having such a program organized by a hospital leads into the completely false assumption that astrology might have some kind of scientific background which, of course, it completely lacks i am horrified by this prospect! so, based on the evidence (or lack thereof), is there any real science to support astrology? there are a few foundational ways to evaluate whether a concept is scientific, and the university of california, berkeley’s understanding science website lays out a science checklist 1 does astrology use testable ideas? for something to have a true scientific basis, it has to encompass testable ideas however, as understanding science explains, some expectations generated by astrology are so general that any outcome could be interpreted as fitting the expectations; if treated this way, astrology is not testable 2 does it rely on evidence? there haven’t been many studies that investigate the science behind astrology, but of the few that have, the results have failed to support the validity of astrological views for instance, a study tested the accuracy of astrological charts in describing the personality traits of 193 study participants, and the results indicated that the scores were at a level consistent with chance so far, it can’t be said that astrology relies on replicable scientific evidence — and replicability is a must for an idea to prove itself as valid 3 does it attempt to explain the natural world? yes, astrology’s basic premise is that the sun, moon, planets, and constellations have an effect on humans and earthly events further, it uses a set of rules about the relative positions and movements of the stars and planets to predict and explain worldly events and human personality however, as understanding science explains, although astrologers seek to explain the natural world, they dont usually attempt to critically evaluate whether those explanations are valid — and this is a key part of science plus, astrology doesn’t lead to ongoing research, which is another key part of science so, unfortunately for everyone who swears their daily horoscope is always on point or blames their stubbornness on being a scorpio or a taurus, it appears that there’s not much scientific evidence to back those claims until then, astrology will have to remain in the realm of pseudoscience you should read this next: science explainer: why gmos aren’t harmful to your health

Article - an unlikely company has suddenly catapulted to the top of the fashion world: amazon amazon is now the biggest seller of clothes online in the us, with its apparel sales totaling $163 billion last year, bloomberg reports thats more than the combined online sales of macys, nordstrom, kohls, gap, and victorias secret parent l brands in the same period, according to bloomberg amazon is now second only to walmart in terms of overall apparel market share, according to morgan stanley analysts the companys rise as a leader in apparel sales has been swift and relatively quiet amazon made one of its first major pushes into the category 10 years ago with the purchase of the clothing website shopbop three years later, amazon bought the online shoe retailer zappos for $850 million over the past couple of years, amazon has ramped up its investment in fashion by launching its own private-label clothing brands and sponsoring the first new york mens fashion week the company has also hired executives from luxury fashion companies, such as julie gilhart, the barneys new york fashion director whom amazon reportedly hired as a consultant, and vogue editor caroline palmer also in the past few years, amazon has started to shift its fashion strategy toward offering more high-end designer names, such as zac posen and stuart weitzman that shift has had some industry experts scratching their heads luxury fashion websites are typically well-merchandised and highly curated — not things for which amazon is necessarily known but amazons strategy appears to be working morgan stanley analysts estimate that amazons apparel sales grew by $11 billion in the most recent quarter, while the department stores nordstrom, sears, macys, kohls, jcpenney, and dillards collectively lost $225 million in apparel sales in the same period department-store executives have blamed declining apparel sales on the weather and on consumers changing shopping habits, which in recent years have gravitated more toward big-ticket items like televisions and vacations over clothing the apparel market has only grown 1% annually in the past 15 years, according to morgan stanley but department stores loss so far has been amazons gain, according to morgan stanley analysts we expect online (primarily amazon) will continue to take share from department stores, but at an accelerating pace over the next five years given new evidence that amazon is gaining traction in fashion, the analysts wrote in a recent note in a 2012 interview with the new york times, amazon ceo jeff bezos gave a simple reason that amazon was investing in fashion: gross profit dollars per unit will be much higher on a fashion item, than with cheaper products, he said

that answer eluded researchers for years after but what was causing it? that answer eluded researchers for years after ruling out an exhaustive list of contaminants, they thought it must be genetic so in 1961, lindenbaum traveled from village to village mapping family trees so researchers could settle the issue but lindenbaum, who continues to but lindenbaum, who continues to write about the epidemic, knew it couldnt be genetic, because it affected women and children in the same social groups, but not in the same genetic groups she also knew that it had started in villages in the north around the turn of the century, and then moved south over the decades lindenbaum had a hunch about what was going on, and she turned out to be right it had to do with funerals specifically, it had to do with eating dead bodies at funerals in many villages, when a person died, they would be cooked and consumed it was an act of love and grief as one medical researcher as one medical researcher described , if the body was buried it was eaten by worms; if it was placed on a platform it was eaten by maggots; the fore believed it was much better that the body was eaten by people who loved the deceased than by worms and insects women removed the brain, women removed the brain, mixed it with ferns, and cooked it in tubes of bamboo they fire-roasted and ate everything except the gall bladder it was primarily adult women who did so, says lindenbaum, because their bodies were thought to be capable of housing and taming the dangerous spirit that would accompany a dead body so, the women took on the role of consuming the dead body and giving it a safe place inside their own body — taming it, for a period of time, during this dangerous period of mortuary ceremonies, says lindenbaum but women would occasionally pass pieces of the feast to children snacks, says lindenbaum they ate what their mothers gave them, she says, until the boys hit a certain age and went off to live with the men then, they were told not to touch that stuff finally, after urging from researchers like lindenbaum, biologists came around to the idea that the strange disease stemmed from eating dead people the case was closed after a group at the us national institutes of health injected infected human brain into chimpanzees, and watched symptoms of kuru develop in the animals months later the group, which finally, after urging from researchers like lindenbaum, biologists came around to the idea that the strange disease stemmed from eating dead people the case was closed after a group at the us national institutes of health injected infected human brain into chimpanzees, and watched symptoms of kuru develop in the animals months later the group, which won a nobel prize for the findings, dubbed it a slow virus but it wasnt a virus — or a bacterium, fungus, or parasite it was an entirely new infectious agent, one that had no genetic material, could survive being boiled, and wasnt even alive as as another group would find years later, it was just a twisted protein, capable of performing the microscopic equivalent of a jedi mind trick, compelling normal proteins on the surface of nerve cells in the brain to contort just like them the so-called prions, or proteinaceous infectious particles, would eventually misfold enough proteins to kill pockets of nerve cells in the brain, leaving the cerebellum riddled with holes, like a sponge the process was so odd that the process was so odd that some compared it to dr jekylls transformation to mr hyde: the same entity but in two manifestations — a kind, innocuous one and a vicious, lethal one the epidemic likely started when one person in a fore village developed sporadic — the difference is that others rarely come into contact with infected human tissue the epidemic likely started when one person in a fore village developed sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease , a degenerative neurological disorder similar to kuru according to the centers for disease control and prevention, about one in a million people in the us develop cjdthe difference is that others rarely come into contact with infected human tissue though the fore stopped the practice of mortuary feasts more than 50 years ago, cases of kuru continued to surface over the years, because the prions could take decades to show their effects according to according to michael alpers , a medical researcher at curtin university in australia who tracked kuru cases for decades, the last person with kuru died in 2009 his team continued surveillance until 2012, when the epidemic was officially declared over i have followed up a few rumoured cases since then but they were not kuru, he wrote in an email enlarge this image when shirley lindenbaum visited a south fore village in 2008, one man said excitedly, see how many children we have now?

kuru showed that people could get a prion disease from eating infected people mad cow disease showed that people can get a prion disease from eating infected cow but what about other prion diseases in other animals? could, say, hunters get sick from eating infected deer? thats what researchers in north america, including belay, are trying to find out right now  chronic wasting disease in north america is spreading fast, says belay the disease causes infected wild deer and elk to starve to death in early 2000, we had about three states that reported cwd in the wild in deer and elk today , that number is 21 belay says the disease is a little bit concerning because, unlike mad cow disease and kuru, where infectious prions were concentrated in the brain and nervous system tissue, in an animal with chronic wasting disease, the misfolded prions show up all over the body they can even be found in saliva, feces and urine, which could explain how the disease is spreading so quickly among wild deer and elk the cdc is working with public health authorities in wyoming and colorado to monitor hunters for signs of prion disease unfortunately, because these diseases have long incubation periods, its not easy to monitor transmission, says belay he says he and his colleagues have yet to find any evidence that hunters have picked up chronic wasting disease from the meat of infected wild animals and that, in itself, is good news for us, he says but, as with kuru, it will take years — maybe even decades — before he can know for sure

Article_Title - if donald trump were black, would the gop base accept him? the answer is obvious
Article - last summer, a black real estate developer and reality television show host — let’s call him donell trump — announced his candidacy for president of the united states a notorious adulterer, donell trump has fathered five children with three different wives over decades in the media spotlight, he has insulted a slew of women by calling them, among many other slurs, fat, ugly and pigs; he told one female journalist she had the face of a dog once the proprietor of a global beauty pageant, whose contestants he routinely demeaned, donell trump is obsessed with boasting about his sexual prowess he joked about the size of his anatomy during a live televised debate and riffed about dating his adult daughter if donell trump’s attitude toward the fairer sex could be distilled into a single sentence, it’s what he told esquire in 1991: it really doesn’t matter what [the media] write about you as long as you’ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass then there’s money donell trump can’t get enough of it he’s obsessed with ostentatious displays of wealth donell trump constantly exaggerates his personal net worth, and his larger-than-life existence — shiny watches, fast cars, big yachts, massive cribs — resembles that of a rap star a substantial part of his fortune was made through shady business ventures that took advantage of working-class people, but donell trump has no apologies donell trump also displays rank ignorance about every single political issue he’s asked about, speaks at a fifth-grade reading level, and has trouble forming grammatically correct sentences he routinely nudges attendees at his rallies to beat up protestors, has boasted that he could shoot someone on manhattan’s 5th avenue to prove his voters’ loyalty to him, and has dropped hints that his supporters should kill his opponent presented with such a presidential candidate — one who seemingly went out of his way to personify every negative stereotype our society holds about black male sexuality, avarice and propensity to violence — how would the republican party base and conservative entertainment industry respond? would bill o’reilly and jerry falwell jr praise donell trump as a model american businessman and moral leader? or would they lament how this habitual homewrecker and baby daddy to three separate women symbolized the epidemic of african american absentee fatherhood? would rush limbaugh insist that donell trump’s half-literate tirades were the heartfelt pleas of a down-to-earth, blue-collar billionaire? or instead treat his listeners to a rant about the inanities of ebonics?  a racial double standard exists at the core of the republican party and conservative media world f t in a sense, we already know how this segment of the right would respond to such a hypothetical black politician, given the way theyve treated president obama an intellectual, ivy league-educated, cool-tempered family man, obama has nevertheless been portrayed by much of the right-wing media as nothing short of the anti-christ, a crypto-muslim manchurian candidate secretly plotting to destroy america meanwhile, many of the same people who claim with a straight face that the plagiarizing former nude model melania trump would make an ideal first lady slam michelle obama’s innocuous healthy-eating initiative as nothing less than a maoist reeducation scheme granted, if conservatives rejected donell trump as unfit for office, they wouldn’t be in the wrong the values donell trump exemplifies — pride, greed, envy, a literal catalog of the seven deadly sins — are ones we ought to recoil from when choosing a president my point is that the very voters and media personalities who would almost certainly condemn donell have embraced donald, which indicates the degree to which a racial double standard exists at the core of the republican party and conservative media world replace the outer-borough white ethnic vulgarity with african american ghetto vernacular and they’d call the man a thug some conservatives may respond to this thought exercise by claiming that, actually, republican voters would enthusiastically welcome a black candidate, a donell trump — so long as he, too, championed nationalist, politically incorrect, anti-immigrant populism but the closest the gop ever had to a black trump, 2012 contender herman cain, fizzled out as soon as sexual harassment allegations against him became public moreover, so much of donald trump’s popularity is based on unsubtle appeals to white nationalism that — despite the thought exercise above — it’s impossible to imagine a true black analogue trump’s hesitance to condemn david duke, his law and order mantra evocative of richard nixon’s southern strategy, and his conspiracy theories about the president’s birth certificate are all intended to whip up white racial resentment which brings us to the crux of the matter: whether the subject is poverty, police brutality or affirmative action, conservatives are loath to acknowledge the presence of racism in american society yet it’s far from hidden; it courses through the presidential campaign, as the notion of a donell trump candidacy clearly shows james kirchick is a fellow with the foreign policy initiative his book the end of europe is forthcoming from yale university press

Article - on television and on the stump, at debates and in speeches, donald trump is reminding the american people that they are going to die the reminders aren’t explicit, and they probably aren’t part of an intentional strategy all the same, much of trump’s rhetoric could have the effect of bringing his viewers’ omnipresent fear of death closer to their conscious minds, according to sheldon solomon, a psychologist at skidmore college in saratoga springs, ny that includes his emphasis on terrorism, unsurprisingly, but also his preoccupation with immigration this focus might be helping trump, since solomon’s recent research shows that people who are thinking about death are more likely to say they support him study subjects who were prompted to talk about their own death later rated their support for trump 166 points higher on a five-point scale than those who were prompted to talk about pain generally i’m not suggesting that any of this is calculated, but almost everything that he does is demonstrably effective for raising these non-conscious, existential concerns that in turn make his kind of candidacy all the more alluring, solomon said solomon is part of a group of researchers that has spent decades investigating the connections between death and a broad variety of human beliefs and behavior their inspiration has been the work of ernest becker, an anthropologist who argued that the fear of death was a kind of fundamental principle in explaining human psychology becker won a pulitzer prize for his 1973 book  solomon is part of a group of researchers that has spent decades investigating the connections between death and a broad variety of human beliefs and behavior their inspiration has been the work of ernest becker, an anthropologist who argued that the fear of death was a kind of fundamental principle in explaining human psychology becker won a pulitzer prize for his 1973 book  the denial of death , but he was shunned in the academic community for what his peers saw as a lack of rigor it was existential, psychodynamic, philosophical speculation for which there was no empirical proof, solomon said he and his colleagues have tried to supply that proof through experimentation their research is still preliminary and controversial, and they haven’t worked out a complete theory, but they have discovered a number of startling facts about how people think about death for example, solomon and florette cohen of the city university of new york, college of staten island recently found evidence that asking people to think about immigrants also gets them thinking about death solomon and cohen asked a small group of volunteers at the college of staten island to respond to one of three prompts one group was asked to write down what they thought would happen, in as much detail as possible, if immigrants moved into their neighborhoods, and what emotions they would feel the other two groups were asked to answer the same questions, but about their own deaths and about feeling intense pain instead of about immigration then the two researchers gave the participants a set of words with letters missing and asked them to fill in the blanks to get an idea of what the participants were thinking about shown c o f f _ _, for example, many people might write coffee, especially students in college if they were thinking about death, however, they might write coffin instead the participants who had been asked to think about immigration had death on their minds, too — almost to the same extent as those who had been asked to think about death explicitly assigned scores from zero to one based on how many words related to death they produced, those who had been asked to think about immigration scored 092 on average, while those who had been asked to think about death scored 096 those asked to think about pain scored just 019 there was no evidence that the effect was greater for conservative participants in the study solomon said he hopes to replicate the study, which was completed with a small group of a few dozen students at the college of staten island yet the results accord with those of similar studies that suggest people interpret challenges to their culture as threats to their very existence yet the results accord with those of similar studies that suggest people interpret challenges to their culture as threats to their very existence a different group of researchers found that after a group of canadians read an article in which canadian cultural tropes were mocked, they were thinking about death, too the pattern extends to religious beliefs the pattern extends to religious beliefs another study found a comparable effect in atheists confronted with arguments in favor of intelligent design, and a third concluded that pointing out logical inconsistencies in the bible made thoughts of death also more accessible to fundamentalist christians for solomon, the research suggests that when people create meaning in their lives — whether through religion, nationality or staying at home with a 30-pack of beer and spraying some cheez whiz on a cracker, in solomon’s words — they are protecting themselves from their constant awareness of death he and his colleagues for solomon, the research suggests that when people create meaning in their lives — whether through religion, nationality or staying at home with a 30-pack of beer and spraying some cheez whiz on a cracker, in solomon’s words — they are protecting themselves from their constant awareness of death he and his colleagues have argued that the same is true of clothing and grooming, and that humans conceal their nature as animals from themselves to avoid thinking about their mortality solomon and his colleagues also have found that thinking about death makes charismatic, resolute leaders more appealing they solomon and his colleagues also have found that thinking about death makes charismatic, resolute leaders more appealing they showed that to be true during president george w bush’s successful campaign for reelection against john f kerry, now the secretary of state, in 2004, and solomon’s new research with cohen has produced similar results for trump they rated participants’ support for trump on a scale out of five points based on their answers to several questions the average rating for those who had been reminded of their mortality was 38 points, but it was just 22 points for those who had been asked to think about pain solomon said these results suggest that the fear of death is one of several interrelated psychological concepts that could help explain why trump has been so successful, including authoritarianism, an aversion to uncertainty and racial prejudice it sure seems like an existentially shaky historical moment where it has become increasingly difficult for the average american to perceive that they have any basis for either meaning or self-worth, solomon said it is a factor, and in a very close election, it could matter

Article - the cataclysmic collision between earth and a mars-size object that forged the moon may have occurred about 447 billion years ago, suggests a study of meteorites with ancient fragments from that cosmic impact this finding suggests that, one day, it may be possible to find samples of what the primordial earth was like before the giant impact that formed the moon, or to uncover bits of the impacting rock itself earth was born about 45 billion years ago, and scientists think the moon formed shortly afterward the leading explanation for the moons origin, known as the giant impact hypothesis, suggests that the moon resulted from the collision of two protoplanets, or embryonic worlds one of those was the young earth, and the other was a potentially mars-size object called theia the moon then coalesced from the rubble [how earths moon was made (a photo timeline)] by understanding the moon, we can tell the story of the early bombardment of earth, study lead author william bottke, a planetary scientist at the southwest research institute in boulder, colorado, told spacecom however, the precise timeline of this giant impact event is under dispute the ages of the most ancient lunar samples the apollo astronauts brought back are still debated, since these samples have typically been battered and heated by subsequent cosmic impacts to understand the formation and evolution of our world as well as those in the inner solar system, we need to understand the timing of major events during the planet-formation era, bottke said to find out more about this giant impact, scientists developed a computer model of the event they found that the impact not only created a disk of debris near earth that formed the moon, but it also ejected huge amounts of rubble — as much as several percent of earths mass — away from earth and the moon the simulations found that numerous fragments from the moon-forming impact — hundreds of millions of which were at least a mile (16 kilometers) long — blasted the asteroid belt, striking asteroids there at speeds of more than 22,370 mph (36,000 km/h), more than twice as fast as typical crashes in the belt these collisions from the moon-forming impact would have generated superheated material, the researchers said in an explosion, there is often collateral damage, where nearby buildings and innocent bystanders are affected, bottke said investigators can learn about the explosive device and the explosion itself by studying what happened to people, infrastructure, and whether trace amounts of the explosive device can be found among the blast damage here, the innocent bystanders were the main-belt asteroids collisions against these asteroids in more recent times returned these remnants to earth in stony meteorites, which the scientists now have analyzed and used to date the age of the impact in a sense, the asteroid belt has been an eyewitness to multiple drive-by shootings from the earliest time in solar system history, bottke said by reading the traces left behind, we can use asteroid samples to tell us who did it, when they did it and how they did it the researchers deduced that the moon-forming impact occurred about 447 billion years ago, in agreement with many previous estimates we can now use asteroids, for the first time, to tell us about many of the major events that took place in the inner solar system during the planet-formation era, bottke said this gives us a new window on a time period which has been virtually unknown up to now this research raises the intriguing possibility that trace amounts of the primordial earth or moon-forming impactor called theia may still be found on asteroids today, or possibly within some of our meteorites, bottke said it may be simply a matter of looking and asking the right questions finding these materials would be one of the holy grails of geology — we have no rocks older than 4 billion years old on earth, and no one knows the exact nature of the original building blocks of our planet if future research can uncover examples of this impact in asteroid samples, possibly by getting them from an asteroid sample return mission like osiris-rex, we would have one of the key pieces of the puzzle explaining why our world is the way it is, and what has changed since its infancy, bottke said the scientists detailed their findings in the april 17 issue of the journal science

Article - a lot of people have large change jars somewhere in their home these repositories are nice to collect our coins in one place, but more often than not, pennies tend to dominate the bulk of the volume the reason for this is not only that pennies are the lowest denomination, but that people don’t want to use pennies anymore it actually costs more for the united states to produce a new penny than a penny is worth, meaning they are literal black holes of value however, just because they may be as good as obsolete in a monetary sense, there are still a lot of things that pennies can be used for with the help of a little creativity that’s exactly what one mom did with her spare pennies knowing her daughter’s love for dancing and playing, she decided to take some of her old pennies and glue them to the bottom of her daughter’s play shoes, and the results were amazing the shoes were transformed into make-shift tap shoes, giving her daughter an extra level of excitement during her play time you might think the sound would be overwhelming, but it was actually quite pleasant to both her and her daughter it wasn’t too different from the sound of actual tap shoes creative mothers like this one will always find a way to bring a little extra joy to their children with whatever means they have at their disposal more parents should take a cue from this nurturing woman

Article - gov rick snyder (r-michigan) will shut down a secret fund that paid salaries to his trusted advisors, living expenses for detroits emergency manager, and new furniture and security for the governors residences, one of his spokepersons confirmed to the huffington post the nerd fund, an acronym for new energy to reinvent and diversify fund, is a nonprofit, but all the donors names have been kept anonymous from the public gov snyder testified in bankruptcy court last week that he did not know any of their identities there’s an independent board that does that work, snyder said under oath, according to the detroit news in 2011, the secretive fund raised more than $13 million but theres been a sharp drop-off in donations for 2012, with only $368,000 being raised, according to a copy of the 2012 irs return obtained by the detroit free press sara wurfel, a spokeswoman for snyder, told the huffington post that the fund had had simply become an unnecessary distraction but she was confident that it had obeyed applicable state and federal laws, none of which require donor names to be disclosed, and all state and federal tax and election laws and regulations were met and followed closely she confirmed that a new fund to solicit donations will go far above and beyond what the law requires -- including full disclosure of donors, gift amounts and expenditure details she also defended snyders need for the fund to subsidize additional government expenses the function and purposed of the fund is essential to continued reinvention efforts, saving taxpayer dollars, and helping ensure responsive, accessible government, wurfel said snyder still has a solid lead over gubernatorial opponent mark schauer in the 2014 election, according to a recent poll published by mirs but the fund has become one of the biggest controversies in the michigan governors tenure many wonder whether donors or special interest groups contributed to the fund in secret have received any favoritism from the governors office nerd is fundamentally involved in remaking the form and purposes of state government, and the interests who benefit from that financially would certainly have an interest in supporting it financially, rich robinson, head of the michigan campaign finance network, told the detroit free press shutting down this slush fund in an attempt to avoid transparency only raises more red flags, said michigan state afl-cio president karla swift in a statement sent to the huffington post republican gov snyder should keep his promises of transparency and immediately disclose which corporate special interests are backing the nerd fund, lon johnson, michigan democratic party chair, added in a statement sent to the huffington post theres still no word on whether gov snyder will make the names of donors to the nerd fund public a new website, secretivesnydercom, asks, when will snyder come clean? how was the nerd fund money spent? paying for the upscale condo rented at the westin book cadillac by detroit emergency manager kevyn orr, as well as other expenses of orrs the condo is rented at a price of $4,200 per month; the fund also paid for travel expenses for orr to see his family, which resides in maryland wurfel told the detroit free press that one of the funds stated purposes is to offset the cost of governance orrs salary is $275,000 given the financial straits of the city, the limited resources of the state, and the very big and challenging job that kevyn was hired to do, it was deemed appropriate and necessary to help save taxpayer dollars, wurfel said $130,638 spent on a security system and new furniture for the state-owned residences used by gov snyder, according to the detroit free press $100,000 in consulting fees to mi partners llc gov snyder was the sole client of the consulting firm run by rich baird, who gov snyder calls his transformation manager, according to the detroit news baird, a snyder adviser who was the architect of the governors successful campaign team, retired as a global partner from pricewaterhousecoopers baird was appointed a state employee on wednesday, according to the detroit news he will take home an annual salary of $140,000 rich dibartolomeo was snyders deputy campaign manager and director of finance he was paid $48,366 for 10 hours of weekly work as assistant secretary and treasurer of the nerd fund (the 501 (c)4s only paid employee of 2011) at the same time, he was also collecting a salary from gov snyders campaign committee, according to citizensforethicsorg he left both positions in june 2012 for another government job: a $115,000-a-year position as the investment administrator for the michigan treasury department (which manages cities and school districts in financial emergencies)

Article - president obama reacts after putting on the first green (manuel balce ceneta/ap) two important things happened today in the political world of president obama the first was that the advocate, a louisiana newspaper chain, the first was that the advocate, a louisiana newspaper chain, published an editorial calling on the president to come to the state to see the horrible flooding first-hand it read, in part: we’ve seen this story before in louisiana, and we don’t deserve a sequel in 2005, a fly-over by a vacationing president george w bush became a symbol of official neglect for the victims of hurricane katrina the current president was among those making political hay out of bush’s aloofness sometimes, presidential visits can get in the way of emergency response, doing more harm than good but we don’t see that as a factor now that flood waters are subsiding, even if at an agonizing pace it’s past time for the president to pay a personal visit, showing his solidarity with suffering americans tough stuff, right? the second thing that happened was the second thing that happened was this tweet obama playing golf at marthas vineyard with larry david today — manu raju (@mkraju) — manu raju (@mkraju) august 18, 2016 cue outrage the i-cant-believe-he-is-on-vacation-while-terrible-news-event-happens narrative is neither new nor unique to obama george w bush was regularly pilloried by his political opponents for extended vacations at his ranch in crawford, tex ( the i-cant-believe-he-is-on-vacation-while-terrible-news-event-happens narrative is neither new nor unique to obama george w bush was regularly pilloried by his political opponents for extended vacations at his ranch in crawford, tex ( bush once took a five-week break during the summer of 2005 ) and, and, as has been documented ad nauseam , theres really no such thing as a vacation for a president of the united statespresidents don’t get vacations — they just get a change of scenery, nancy reagan famously told critics of her husbands regular trips to the familys ranch work, especially in this digital age, follows you around still, its worth noting this moment and thats because it speaks to obamas unique and long-lasting commitment to not playing by a core rule of modern politics: making at least some decisions based on how it looks and/or how it will play obama has long been a rejectionist on this front his stubborn refusal to rebut claims regarding what was in the affordable care act badly hamstrung his partys attempt to win the fight for public perception on the law his unwillingness to say the words radical islamic terror have become a hobbyhorse for conservatives and republican presidential nominee donald trump and so on and so forth obama just doesnt like to fake it if he doesnt want to do something or thinks its stupid to do it — regardless of whether it actually is stupid — he wont do it obama just doesnt like to fake it if he doesnt want to do something or thinks its stupid to do it — regardless of whether it actuallyisstupid — he wont do it this riff in response to republican criticism of how obama describes the threat posed by the islamic state militant group, which is also known as isis and isil, captures his view on perception politics nicely: for a while now, the main contribution of some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have made in the fight against isil is to criticize this administration and me for not using the phrase radical islam that’s the key, they tell us — we can’t beat isil unless we call them radical islamists what exactly would using this label accomplish? what exactly would it change? would it make isil less committed to trying to kill americans? would it bring in more allies? is there a military strategy that is served by this? the answer is none of the above calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away this is a political distraction there has not been a moment in my seven and a half years as president where we have not been able to pursue a strategy because we didn’t use the label radical islam not once has an adviser of mine said, man, if we really use that phrase, were going to turn this whole thing around not once so if someone seriously thinks that we don’t know who were fighting, if theres anyone out there who thinks were confused about who our enemies are, that would come as a surprise to the thousands of terrorists who weve taken off the battlefield hes genuinely angry — not an emotion you see all that much from any politician at that level but particularly the usually calm and professorial obama and hes angry because in obamas mind the sort of performance-for-the-sake-of-performance that republicans are demanding is everything thats wrong with politics (nota bene: for all of you all he does is perform readers, i know that is a view of obama that many people hold i am not blind to it but this piece is about how obama thinks of himself  not how you or i think of him now back to our regularly scheduled programming) thats why obama wont break off his vacation in marthas vineyard — or stop playing golf on said vacation — to travel to louisiana because he believes he can monitor the situation as well — or better — from where he is and that the sole reason to go to louisiana is for the theatrical piece of politics, a piece that he not only rejects but detests

it seems new zealand, with a population of 44 million, has become the best option for a new breed of american survivalist when the new zealand herald revealed this week that silicon valley tech billionaire peter thiel had become a citizen and purchased a lake-front estate it perhaps shouldnt have been a surprise mr thiel, who previously said new zealand was a utopia and has invested heavily there, is just one of several us migrants who have realised what the country has to offer punching above its weight new zealand recently overtook singapore as the best place to do business, according to the world bank transparency international ranks it as the worlds least corrupt country, and the 2016 global peace index said it was the fourth safest behind iceland, denmark and austria weve definitely had an increase in american inquiries, and at least one sale that has been a direct run-off from the presidential result in the united states, says nick horton, an agent specialising in luxury real estate theres just a feeling that people want to create a bolthole in the southern hemisphere thats away from some of the problems facing the western world, he says recently, the new yorker magazine ran a piece titled doomsday prep for the super-rich it detailed the rise in wealthy investors who see new zealand as their escape from a volatile world it is safe and clean the west coast of the united states is a 13-hour flight away, and modern technology has tamed the tyranny of distance the temperate, mountainous country is also comparably well-placed to deal with rising sea levels, and its most recent major attack was in 1985, when french spies blew up a greenpeace vessel in auckland harbour however, as horton explains, the interest from the united states is not new the same happened after the global financial crisis, and the same thing happened after obama was elected, when some people thought the united states wouldnt tolerate having a black leader us surge according to immigration new zealand, in november 2016 when the us presidential election was held, 17,584 people registered their interest to study, work or invest in the country, compared with 1,272 in november 2015 in the two days following the election, the agency said its website received 88,353 visits from the united states - compared to a usual daily average of 2,300 visits a day registrations have remained higher than average, with 3,159 received this month, compared to 1,724 in january 2016 however, registrations are far higher than actual visa applications between october and december last year, 348 residency visas were granted to people from the united states, compared with 338 in the same period in 2015 work visas rose from 2,296 to 2,699 over the same period what we are experiencing at the moment is a slight increase in visas issued to american nationals, both temporary work visas and permanent resident visas, steve mcgill, general manager at immigration new zealand, told the bbc we have had a pretty active strategy of identifying investors out of america over the past few years its a combination of our marketing effort, and a bit of global uncertainty that means new zealand is a pretty attractive place, mr mcgill said the revelation that mr thiel had quietly become a new zealand citizen has raised some questions about the processes for foreign investors, with some politicians asking how, exactly, he was able to secure it and whether he was given special treatment but mr mcgill said opposition to wealthy investors, who can secure a residency visa by spending a minimum amount in the country, was not a major issue i am aware of the recent commentary around mr thiel, but there is no evidence of any backlash against migrant investors coming in what we do know is that many of the investors who come out deliver significant value in the form of job creation in the communities we are a small island nation at the bottom of the world with lots of resources and opportunities and we need to maximise that, and some of the way we can do that is bringing in investors, he said better lifestyle it isnt just the mega-wealthy that are attracted to new zealand sarah coombes-crome, an immigration consultant, said that traffic to her firms website was up approximately 600% the day after donald trump won the election and has remained higher than average they are from all over the united states and are educated, looking to either work in new zealand or invest if they have a considerable amount of capital behind them i think new zealand and the united states are very similar, she said they are both english speaking countries, they think similar, they have the same values and similar religious beliefs its also very easy to buy a property or do business in new zealand, you can move your money around freely chris whelan, the chief executive of the wellington regional economic development agency, says the country offers plenty of career opportunities, but with a much better lifestyle that you would find elsewhere i was talking to someone out of san diego this morning and hes looking to invest potentially tens of millions of dollars in new zealand for him its got excellent skills, excellent talent, and what was previous a boundary (distance) with modern technology youre connected to the world all the time its a country with a similar land mass to britain but with 44 million people

Article - white wine, beer and brussels sprouts can be major sources of the toxic metal arsenic in peoples diets, according to a new study researchers analyzed the diets of 852 people in new hampshire, and the levels of arsenic in their toenails, which show long-term exposure to the chemical of the 120 foods the researchers looked at, four turned out to significantly raise peoples arsenic levels: beer, white wine (and to a lesser extent, red wine), brussels sprouts and dark-meat fish such as salmon, tuna and sardines, according to the study, published last week (nov 16) in the nutrition journal the most significant source of arsenic in most peoples diets is drinking water the new study is the first to take into account the levels of arsenic in the participants household water when looking at the amount of arsenic coming from foods the results suggest that diet can be an important source of peoples arsenic exposure over the long term, regardless of arsenic concentrations in their drinking water, the researchers said the element arsenic occurs naturally in the environment long-term exposure to arsenic, even at low levels, has been linked to increased risks of bladder, lung and skin cancer, as well as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease the environmental protection agency (epa) limits the arsenic in drinking water to 10 micrograms per litter for drinking water, but there are few limits set for foods [5 things you should know about arsenic] in the study, the arsenic levels in the participants household tap water were well below the epa limit, at 030 micrograms per liter, on average however, 52 participants had tap water arsenic levels higher than the epas limits the arsenic levels in participants toenails were 012 micrograms per gram, on average however, it is unclear what level of concentration found in toenail samples might signal an unsafe level of arsenic exposure, said study author kathryn cottingham, researcher at dartmouth college in new hampshire the toenail measurements in the study served only as a way to compare levels among people, the researchers said people who reported drinking on average two and half beers or a glass of white wine every day had arsenic levels 20 to 30 percent higher than those of people who didnt drink the study wasnt designed to find why higher consumption of beer and wine was linked to higher arsenic levels, but a few scenarios are possible, cottingham said [7 ways alcohol affects your health] one possibility is that the ingredients in beer and wine are high in arsenic it is also possible that arsenic is added during the filtration process that gives beer and wine their sparkly, clear looks, as one recent study suggested, cottingham said and lastly, alcohol itself may be to blame for the higher arsenic levels, by impairing the bodys ability to detoxify arsenic the mechanisms that our bodies use to try to get rid of the stuff that is not good for us can be impaired by alcohol consumption, cottingham said the researchers didnt find a link between arsenic levels and intake of rice, which is thought to be relatively high in arsenic but in line with previous studies, they found that the more dark-meat fish people ate, the higher were their arsenic levels people who ate dark-meat fish once a week had about a 7 percent higher arsenic concentration in their toenails compared with people who consumed these fish less than once a month although some foods are high in arsenic, people dont need to avoid them entirely, cottingham said probably the best way to avoid exposure from diet is to mix it up in the foods, and not eat the same thing every day its also important to keep water sources safe, she said if someone is drinking water from a private well, they should get it tested water is something we are drinking and using every day, cottingham said so knowing what your water exposure is, i think, is a big piece of the puzzle

Article_Title - heres what donald trump rejects when he undermines the election results
Article - in what immediately became the headline moment at the third and final presidential debate on wednesday night, republican candidate donald trump sparked widespread outrage by saying he would keep the nation in suspense about whether he will accept the results of the election next month but, sir, there is a tradition in this country—in fact, one of the prides of this country is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner, said moderator chris wallace not saying that you’re necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country indeed, the nations ability to regularly and peacefully replace the president was, to the world of the 1700s, one of the most striking elements of the american experiment as john adams himself wrote to his wife upon his becoming the second president in 1797, the transfer of power was the sublimest thing ever exhibited in america but while adams was the first to experience that transition, it wasnt until four years later that the principle was put to the test after all, george washington didnt want to run again for the 1796 election and adams kept power within the same party in 1800, on the other hand , the united states saw its first hotly contested election and its first transfer of power between political parties the result was close, and it also left thomas jefferson and aaron burr tied, with the house spending a week deciding who would be president (at the time, the vice president was whoever came in second) it was easily conceivable that the entire system would fall apart, but instead jefferson became president and his rivals—the incumbent adams as well as burr—accepted the result as jefferson would later write , the revolution of 1800 was a big deal: [it was] as real a revolution in the principles of our government as that of 1776 was in its form; not effected indeed by the sword, as that, but by the rational and peaceable instrument of reform, the suffrage of the people the nation declared its will by dismissing functionaries of one principle, and electing those of another, in the two branches, executive and legislative, submitted to their election this principle—that the nation declares its will by voting, and the functionaries of government peacefully accept the choice—has even been upheld when perhaps the candidate might have wished to do otherwise for example, some believe that the 1960 presidential election was subject to substantial enough voting irregularities that richard nixon should have won (in fact, there is no concrete evidence either way ) but, even though it was an extremely close race and some of his supporters urged him to fight the result, nixon decided that, in keeping with tradition, it was better to accept the fact that early returns indicated john f kennedy had won in a late-night speech to supporters, he explained why: as all of you in this room know, and as all of you millions who are listening on television and radio realize, it is normally the custom for a candidate for the presidencynot to appear until after the decision is definitely known, and all the votes are counted beyond doubt however, i have been keeping some pretty late hours recently as some of you havei know too that many who are listening in the eastern part of the united states will find that it is now about 3:15 in the morning i want to say that one of the great features of america is that we have political contests, that they are very hard fought, as this one was hard fought, and once the decision is made, we unite behind the man who is elected i want senator kennedy to know, and i want all of you to know, that certainly if this trend continues, and if he does become our next president, he will have my whole-hearted support that tradition even held true in 2000 as times david von drehle has pointed out , that years concession from al gore to george w bush was a long time in coming not because gore refused to accept the results of the vote, but because there was no result to accept yet in fact, when it became clear what the result would be, gore followed the precedent of hundreds of years worth of elections, as he peacefully accepted the outcome of the vote as he explained in his concession speech, that was what patriotism required: almost a century and a half ago, senator stephen douglas told abraham lincoln, who had just defeated him for the presidency, partisan feeling must yield to patriotism im with you, mr president, and god bless you well, in that same spirit, i say to president-elect bush that what remains of partisan rancor must now be put aside, and may god bless his stewardship of this country neither he nor i anticipated this long and difficult road certainly neither of us wanted it to happen yet it came, and now it has ended, resolved, as it must be resolved, through the honored institutions of our democracy that doesnt mean the tradition has always been honored by everyone in 1860, after abraham lincoln was elected, stephen douglas (the runner-up for the popular vote) had cause to utter those words later quoted by gore, as he conceded the result but, even before the election took place, the south had already warned the nation that a victory by lincoln and the republican party would be unacceptable in their eyes south carolina seceded from the union that december, declaring that the north was united in the election of a man to the high office of president of the united states whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery rather than accept the electoral result, the state convention announced that public opinion at the north has invested a great political error and that south carolina would not go along with the outcome the rest of the confederacy would soon follow south carolinas lead by april, the civil war had begun

someone believed in them today panhandlers are hired to beautify the city (city of albuquerque mayor’s office) berry’s effort is a shift from the movement across the country to criminalize panhandling a berry’s effort is a shift from the movement across the country to criminalize panhandling a recent national law center on homelessness & poverty report found a noticeable increase, with 24 percent of cities banning it altogether and 76 percent banning it in particular areas there is a persisting stigma that people begging for money are either drug addicts or too lazy to work and are looking for an easy handout but that’s not necessarily the reality panhandling is not especially lucrative, but for some people it can seem as if it’s the only option when they’ve been approached in albuquerque with the offer of work, most have been eager for the opportunity to earn money, berry said they just needed a lift one man told him no one had said a kind word to him in 25 years kellie tillerson, director of employment services at st martin’s hospitality center, the organization that facilitates the city’s program, said the way to dispel people of the negative associations with panhandlers is for them to do what the mayor did and engage on a human level kellie tillerson, director of employment services at st martin’s hospitality center, the organization that facilitates the city’s program, said the way to dispel people of the negative associations with panhandlers is for them to do what the mayor did and engage on a human level genuinely ask why they are in the predicament they are, tillerson said many have medical conditions, they don’t have the proper identification — you can’t get a job without one they don’t have a social security card those little things we take for granted prohibit people from getting a job don’t assume they are lazy the there’s a better way van employs about 10 workers a day but could easily take more when the van fills, people have begged to get a spot next time, she said that’s why the city has increased funding for the program to expand it from two to four days a week and it inspired st martin’s to start its own day labor program, connecting the jobless to employers in the area who could offer side jobs tillerson said a lot of the people who get picked up by the van were not aware of all the services available to them one man who recently got out of prison returned to st martin’s the day after taking one of the city’s jobs she said it enrolled him in the day-labor program, told him about behavioral health services and are helping him get an id he now has a support system he didn’t know he needed and definitely didn’t know existed, she said it’s life-changing for them he was one that said, ‘i would much rather earn my money than have someone hand it to me’  dozens of cities around the country have reached out to berry wanting to copy the program it’s a testament, he said, to the work mayors do regardless of political party he was the first republican mayor elected in albuquerque in 30 years, and he’s proactively tackling homelessness the program hasn’t weeded out all panhandling in the city, and supporters say that’s not really the point it’s connecting people who would otherwise not seek help to needed services and it’s showing them when they are at their lowest that they have real value, and that others are willing to show them kindness to help them have a better life it’s helping hundreds of people, berry said, and our city is more beautiful than ever

a corn is actually a type of callus it’s a round bump of hard, dead skin and is usually found on the thin skin of your body, like the tops of your fingers and toes like a callus, corns form where the skin regularly rubs against something, like where the knuckles of your toes run against the top of your shoes unlike a callus, corns are often painful due to being a hard, ball-like shape that digs in, rather than a broader surface so, if you have issues with corns and calluses, what can you do? remedy #1: apple cider vinegar and castor oil in a bowl or basin of hot, soapy water, add 1 cup apple cider vinegar and soak your feet this will soften calluses enough to file down with a pumice stone for corns, rub a dab of castor oil on each one after each soak do this daily, and your feet will be soft and smooth in about 10 days a word about filing down calluses: be gentle it will take longer, but rubbing hard with a pumice stone will actually just make the callus worse remedy #2: vitamin e or vitamin a while they’re meant to be taken internally, you can also topically use the gel inside of vitamin capsules by breaking them open and squeezing a bit out rubbing the oil inside a vitamin e or vitamin a capsule is a great treatment for corns rub the contents of a capsule on a corn before going to bed, then cover with a clean cotton sock do this every night until the corn disappears remedy #3: lemon peel slice off a piece of lemon peel the width of the toe with the corn on it press it pith-side down on the corn and secure with a bandage keep everything in place with a clean cotton sock and wear overnight repeat every night until the corn is gone remedy #4: onion and white vinegar like the lemon peel, a piece of onion soaked for about a day in white vinegar, secured to the foot and left on overnight, also breaks down corns but be forewarned that the smell will be much stronger! just like the lemon peel, the vinegar-soaked onion piece should be attached with a bandage, covered with a sock, and left on overnight remedy #5: bread and apple cider vinegar half a slice of stale bread soaked in apple cider vinegar is a great way to get rid of a callus that takes up a large area, like across the heel or ball of your foot attach the soaked piece of bread to the foot with some plastic wrap to make sure it doesn’t leak, and then cover with a sock the callus will be softened and ready to file, or gone completely by morning remedy #6: castor oil this remedy can be done during the day and worn under socks and shoes as you go about your business it’s also great for corns on small, hard-to-bandage places take a non-medicated corn pad and place around the corn dab a few drops of castor oil onto the corn, and then cover with some adhesive tape to keep everything in place if you’re wearing socks, wear old ones in case the oil leaks remedy #7: aspirin crush about five uncoated aspirin tablets into powder, and mix with equal parts apple cider vinegar and water to form a paste rub the paste generously onto a corn or callus, and wrap with a bandage to hold in place leave the paste on for at least 10 minutes, then rub the corn or callus with a pumice stone, and it should come off

Article - tim connor stands by a sign his neighbor purchased to thwart commuters from cutting through their quiet residential street in takoma park, md (evelyn hockstein/for the washington post) when the traffic on timothy connor’s quiet maryland street suddenly jumped by several hundred cars an hour, he knew who was partly to blame: the disembodied female voice he could hear through the occasional open window saying, continue on elm avenue     the marked detour around a months-long road repair was several blocks away but plenty of drivers were finding a shortcut past connor’s takoma park house, slaloming around dog walkers and curbside basketball hoops, thanks to waze and other navigation apps i could see them looking down at their phones, said connor, a water engineer at a federal agency we had traffic jams, people were honking it was pretty harrowing and so connor borrowed a tactic he read about from the car wars of southern california and other traffic-weary regions: he became a waze impostor every rush hour, he went on the google-owned social-media app and posted false reports of a wreck, speed trap or other blockage on his street, hoping to deflect some of the flow he continued his guerrilla counterattack for two weeks before the app booted him off, apparently detecting a saboteur in its ranks that made connor a casualty in the social-media skirmishes erupting across the country as neighborhoods try to contend with suddenly savvy drivers finding their way on routes that were once all but secret waze is a navigation app that uses user-collected data to calculate the quickest and safest routes to users destinations heres what you need to know about the app (jhaan elker/the washington post) [a warning left on a nanny’s car license plates stolen and a pentagon official in big trouble] it used to be that only locals knew all the cut-through routes, but google maps and waze are letting everyone know, said bates mattison, a city councilman in the atlanta suburb of brookhaven, ga in some extreme cases, we have to address it to preserve the sanctity of a residential neighborhood when population growth began to overwhelm a set of major intersections in his district, there was an increase of 45,000 cars a day on some residential streets, as app-armed commuters fought their way to nearby interstate 85 in response, the city is posting signs to restrict left or right turns at key intersections the apps didn’t create the traffic, mattison said, but they gave drivers options they wouldn’t have known about otherwise waze, with 50 million users worldwide, provides navigation guidance by combining its map database with data it collects in real time from every logged-on driver average speed, backups and fleeting hazards such as a car pulled over to change a flat appear almost instantly on the app’s cartoonish interface when the first waze-enabled car finds its way to a promising shortcut, thousands can follow in portland, ore, for example, when drivers trying to avoid local construction began flooding a street that had been redesigned as a greenway bike route, city officials had to put up barrels on some stretches to filter out the vehicular through-traffic it worked the apps reacted pretty quickly to that, said jonathan maus, publisher of bikeportlandorg in california, where navigation apps are as common to drivers as sunglasses, several communities are contending with overwhelmed local streets that residents blame at least in part on the programs in the los angeles region, waze’s biggest us market, a city council person representing sherman oaks is considering a motion asking the programs to exclude some small residential streets from their algorithms it was here that connor learned that some waze warriors had launched concerted campaigns to fool the app neighbors filed false reports of blockages, sometimes with multiple users reporting the same issue to boost their credibility but waze was way ahead of them [a marine fights to prove he’s innocent of sexual misconduct then a lost cellphone is found] it’s not possible to fool the system for long, according to waze officials for one thing, the system knows if you’re not actually in motion more important, it constantly self-corrects, based on data from other drivers the nature of crowdsourcing is that if you put in a fake accident, the next 10 people are going to report that it’s not there, said julie mossler, waze’s head of communications the company will suspend users they suspect of tampering with the map, she said waze’s mission is to distribute traffic more efficiently across the grid of public streets, mossler said, not to create traffic jams that said, the traffic has to go somewhere, she said although the app will continue to route drivers down any legal street, waze programmers are working to build in alerts about school zones and other slow-speed zones, mossler said traffic engineers say the side street flare-ups are a downside to the otherwise positive effect that navigation apps can have on vehicle flow they have proved to be a powerful force in moving cars past bottlenecks, and in many jurisdictions, including maryland and the district, officials have begun working directly with waze to glean information about potholes, backups and other real-time data the cut-through disputes are an unintended consequence of this great technology that is supposed to help people avoid sitting in traffic, said paul silberman, a traffic engineer with sabra, wang & associates in columbia, md those who live on side streets have been complaining for years about becoming through routes, but now it’s happening at internet speed these great shortcuts used to spread by word of mouth, but now they just spread like wildfire, silberman said [three workers once died rebuilding this bridge now a new makeover is under way] in takoma park, connor complained to the city’s public works and police departments, but nothing stemmed the flow he put out two plastic watch-for-children figures, but one was hit by a car and the other was stolen connor and his neighbors put up no through traffic signs and their city councilman, tim male, tried to get google maps to take note of the official detour, by calling the company and flagging it through the apps’ feedback feature but still they came one afternoon, connor counted a vehicle every two seconds on a street with a single lane available between parked cars one morning, neighbors awoke to a cacophony of honks and went out to find a backup dozens of cars deep, two drivers in the middle about to come to blows soon after, connor went rogue he experimented with waze, confirmed it was sending drivers down his street and began filing his false reports it didn’t do much and within two weeks they stopped showing up on the map all together, connor said they were on to me the traffic flow began to wane when the road construction ended, connor said, but remains three or four times higher than before it began for some drivers, their app-inspired shortcut became a permanent route

six months before i graduated, i received a letter stating how much i would owe every month when i graduated it was going to be $500 a month or so i dont remember the number, but it was a number i felt was way too high for my income i decided i didnt want it hanging over my head for the rest of my life, so i figured i would try to pay it off as quickly as i could so i didnt have to worry about it 10 years from now i figured a little bit of pain now would be worthwhile later so in addition to being a financial analyst, i also did a bunch of side jobs altogether, i was working 100 hours a week my side jobs consisted of taking surveys, mystery shopping, doing staff writing, doing research phone calls for companies and other things as soon as i earned any extra money, i put it toward my student loan debt so it wouldnt be sitting in my bank account and i wouldnt be thinking of other ways to spend it what were your expenses during this time? my boyfriend at the time (now my husband) and i had bought a house when we were 20, and our mortgage was less than $1,000, but i had other regular expenses like transportation, groceries, etc we also had combined our finances, so it helped that we shared our bills when did the blog start coming into the picture? i had actually started my blog in august 2011, before i graduated with my finance mba i got the idea one day when i was reading cosmo and they had an article featuring the personal finance site daily worth i started reading that website and i became super-interested in personal finance blogs i started my blog as a hobby i didnt start it thinking id make an income from it six months later, i made my first $100 from my blog when a blogger friend who was already profiting from her blog connected me with an advertiser i didnt even know blogs could make money until then, my blog had genuinely just been fun for me but once i realized i could make money, it boosted my motivation i sought out deals and wanted to see if companies wanted to sponsor my blog also, companies would approach me when my blog had been just a hobby, they would approach me, but i would ignore all those emails once i realized i could make money from my blog, i took them more seriously and gave them my rates at that time, i charged $100 for a sponsored post on my blog or $150 for an advertisement on my sidebar  i also made a little bit on google adsense and affiliate income, where i was promoting other companies products, and if one of my readers bought through me, the company would pay me my advertisers were mainly financial companies like coupon websites and cell phone apps and other services that helped people save money at that time, it wasnt so much banks, but i do have bank advertisers now and i charge them much more than that of course i also started looking for opportunities writing for other bloggers and immersing myself into the blogging community how much did you earn from the blog to begin with? in the beginning, in may of 2012, i earned $500 and by december 2012, i was up to $5,700 that month the month i paid off my student loans, july of 2013, i earned $11,000 that month how exactly does the blog bring in money? now, im making money in much different ways from just a few years ago before i was making money from sponsored posts and by writing for other blogs, and now the majority is through affiliate marketing   $50,000 a month is from that, and thats the bulk of my income there are 15-20 companies i actively promote on my social media and blog platform the other big revenue stream is my affiliate marketing course, in which i teach other bloggers how to create affiliate income in november 2016, that accounted for $38,000 of my income i created that because i had so many bloggers email me asking them to teach them how to increase their affiliate marketing earnings now its more a form of passive income, since i already created the source and people just purchase it and all the instructions and lessons are already done my third biggest source of income from my blog is advertising in those instances, maybe i partner with a bank and they ask me to advertise a certain service or product that they are currently selling or i participate in a twitter chat with the company, or they do some kind of advertisement on my social media platforms why did your income roughly triple from 2015 to 2016? in 2015, i decided to stop doing all my freelancing i stopped doing virtual assisting and decided to focus entirely on my blogging business i was nervous to get rid of all my clients, but i realized i truly loved blogging myself and not blogging for others by focusing on my business, i was finally able to find ways to diversify my income, improve my blog, increase my traffic, and come up with extra ideas for my blog, such as the course, which now accounts for a big chunk of my income   20%-30% i also was able to focus on affiliate marketing and improving my traffic, which directly relates to making more money blogging as well it only took me a few months after i dropped all those clients to start seeing the jump in my income i was making $12,000-$15,000 monthly when i decided i was going to focus just on my own business, then i made a jump to the $20,000-$30,000 range, and it just kept going to $40,000, then $50,000, to where i am now at $100,000 how has your changing income changed your lifestyle? as a full-time blogger i have a flexible schedule and am my own boss and now travel full-time my husband, who used to be a new car salesman, quit his day job at the same time i quit mine in october 2013 when i was making $10,000 a month from the blog   and now works on the blog too at the time, we were making more from our day jobs put together than from the blog, but we knew we could live off our blog if we did it full-time the main lifestyle change is that we live in an rv, are location-independent and work wherever we can we sold our house in missouri in july 2015 and now we work from wherever why did you start living in an rv? my husband has always wanted to live in an rv, and he spent a long time convincing me to live in an rv theres always a joke in the rv community that theres always one person who wants to do it and then the other person has to spend years convincing the other person to do it  thats pretty much how it was but i stepped into an rv one day   we just decided to look at one   and i loved being in it so we decided to give rving a shot it was just going to be a weekend thing to see family or do short weekend or week trips, but we came to love it and never went home we would be gone for a month or two at a time, so we just decided to turn the rv thing into a full-time venture and havent looked back since how big was your house?  we had a finished basement, and so if you count that, 2,500 square feet if you dont, it was 1,200 square feet with three bedrooms how big is the rv? its 400 square feet if you include all the slides being out did you have to get rid of a lot of stuff? yes, the salvation army came and took a bunch of stuff, and we rented a dumpster to collect broken appliances and junk and we had neighbors come and just take whatever they wanted for free we kept clothing and photo albums how does living in an rv make your finances different from other peoples? it doesnt really change our rv cost more than our house, but rving can be as cheap or expensive as you want it to be   just like with a normal home there are cheap rvs, and there are rvs worth millions of dollars its comparable to living in a home, but i have a different view all the time there are free places to stay, but we mainly choose private campgrounds or state parks that cost money we usually stay in one place for a month we like to follow the weather, so we like to stay in a forever 70-degree weather area, and we like to follow activities we like such as riding our bikes outside and going for a hike, so 70-degree weather is what were looking for all year long how has all this newfound wealth changed you? im not as stressed about money as i was just a few years ago but im just as frugal as before its not below me to use a coupon i just dont like to be wasteful if theres a way to save money, im not going to waste time to find ways to save money, but if a money saver is there, ill go for it how has your wealth changed your relationships? it really hasnt changed them too much were often told that people are surprised were the same and that you would expect people making $100,000 a month to not be as nice or down to earth but many of our friends still call us down-to-earth how was money handled when you were growing up and what habits or attitudes did you carry into adulthood?  my mom wasnt super good with money, but my dad was better, so i learned what to do from him he taught me how to live within my budget and also how to use a credit card correctly a lot of people think credit cards are the root of all evil, but you can use them to build your credit score and you can earn rewards points with them im still very frugal i dont pay for any form of tv, i dont have cable, netflix, hulu or anything like that we havent spent any money on tv since february 2015 to save money and also to not spend as much time watching tv i feel like theres plenty of things to watch on local channels if i had any more channels, id be in front of the tv all day long how much time do you spend on your blog? between 40 and 60 hours a week i work longer hours when im trying to get far ahead in my blog content i currently do three blog posts a week do you have help? i do have an editor who edits my site and a tech person to make sure my site is always up and live and no one is hacking it what do you do with your extra income?  we invest a lot in vanguard funds and are saving for retirement one day by next year, we should have plenty of money to retire early if we chose too but i still love blogging, so i dont see that ending anytime soon for the next few years, we plan on rving here and in canada, and then afterward sailing full-time and go to other countries id have to find ways to manage my internet access but we do know many bloggers who blog full-time and sail, so its not impossible

one reporter following trump has taken to logging the falsehoods he tells each day: no small task take two areas where you’d assume that to be caught in untruth would be terminal for a presidential candidate trump has been exposed for serial lying over 9/11 , falsely claiming to have lost hundreds of friends that day; to have seen thousands of muslims cheering the fall of the twin towers; and to have helped in the rescue effort he even milked cash from a 9/11 relief fund this week he was found to have raided $258,000 from the charitable foundation that bears his name to settle assorted legal problems earlier he dipped into that same charity box, filled by others’ donations, to pay for a larger than life $10,000 painting – of himself he lies about 9/11 he lies about charity but on he strides but trump himself presents her with an unprecedented conundrum how does she take on a candidate who lies and lies and lies?’ so where can hillary begin? if she calls him a liar, he’ll hit back over her use of a private email server, calling her crooked hillary, knowing that some 60% of americans believe she’s dishonest the risk is that he’ll use her experience and expertise against her, casting her as the boring know-it-all against the freewheeling, entertaining guy who relies on good old gut instinct if that sounds familiar, that’s because it’s a show we’ve already seen in 2000 al gore was clearly the more accomplished, ready-for-office candidate but he came across as impatient and pompous against the looser, backslapping george w bush never mind that one was a visionary on the issue of climate change while the other would lead the us into the catastrophic invasion of iraq on the night, bush came across better on tv which brings us to a core problem facing hillary clinton polls show there are millions of voters, especially young ones, who agree in big numbers that trump is a racist and a sexist, unqualified for america’s highest office – but who are refusing to back clinton one survey of 18- to 34-year-olds recorded dire numbers for trump, but still found only 31% supporting clinton, with 29% preferring libertarian gary johnson and 15% the green candidate jill stein if those numbers are replicated on election day, trump will win this too stirs queasy memories of 2000 in that year, a small but significant bloc on the left voted for ralph nader instead of gore more than 90,000 voted for nader in florida, a state gore was eventually deemed to have lost by just 537 votes had even a tiny fraction of those naderites decided to hold their nose and choose gore instead, there would have been no bush presidency – and no iraq war i know this is a sore, and contested, point among those who chose nader, who to this day blame gore for not doing enough to appeal to the left (forgetting perhaps that he also had to appeal to centrist voters in order to win the election) but the basic case is surely clear in a two-party system like america’s, if you want to stop trump, then a vote for johnson or stein will not do it only a vote for clinton can prevent a white nationalist bigot becoming the next us president you might think this is all so obvious that it barely needs stating but 2000 can seem like ancient history to those who don’t remember it and here, younger voters are not to blame older liberals haven’t seared the bush calamity into the minds of the next generation they never turned 2000 into a cautionary tale of the cost of third-party indulgence as the new republic put it this week, liberals have failed to teach millennials about the horror of george w bush (republicans, meanwhile, bang on about the supposedly dismal presidency of jimmy carter to this day, just as british conservatives invoked the 1979 winter of discontent for over three decades it is the centre-left that is oddly reticent about exploiting its opponents’ history of failure) so now, even though the hour is late, this is the case democrats must make that this is an exceptional election because donald trump represents an exceptional menace, to america and to the world it is indeed a referendum on trump and the only way to vote no in that referendum is to vote clinton she may not be the candidate of your dreams, but she’s all that stands between you and an american nightmare you don’t have to love her you don’t even have to like her you’re not saying she’s flawless (though the current democratic platform is its most progressive in 30 years, thanks in part to the challenge of bernie sanders) as joe biden puts it, don’t compare her to the almighty compare her to the alternative and the alternative is president trump

Article - apple is expected to unveil its next iphone in a few weeks and, as is usual pattern, more and more credible leaks have come out about what will presumably be called the iphone 7 bloomberg probably has the most accurate reporting thus far (thanks to its hiring of apple reporter mark gurman) in a report that basically confirms what has leaked out about the iphone over the next few months the big news is that the form factor will remain largely the same, there will be a dual-lens camera system for the larger iphone, and the home button will provide haptic feedback rather than depress like a physical button oh yeah, and the headphone jack ? its dead dunzo lets all take a moment of silence for the headphone jack not to downplay the new stuff (though i have thoughts on that, just wait), its worth noting that this follows my playbook for bulletproof iphone predictions to a tee in case you need a reminder, this is what we can always expect from a new iphone: it will be apples fastest iphone ever it will have apples most advanced optics there will be at least one extra feature you cant get on any other iphone it will come in rose gold and now, i guess we can add, it wont have a headphone jack still, im sure im not the only person who looks at the leaks of the next iphone and says, huh ok     if were being honest, this probably wont be the most exciting iphone release weve seen this isnt to say i wont still buy the next iphone — im totally going to buy the new iphone in september — but if were being honest, this probably wont be the most exciting iphone release weve seen personally, i think thats ok im not completely sure how i feel about apple potentially shifting the design upgrade from every two years to every three — new colors aside, that makes it really hard to show off that youve got the latest and greatest phone — but now that were nearly a decade into the modern smartphone era, it might not be realistic to expect new designs every other year regardless of what other whiz-bang goodness apple introduces this year — and im sure there will be at least one feature that will make even the most jaded amongst us salivate — the reality is that this will absolutely be the iphone remembered as the one where apple dropped the headphone jack thats it pack it up waterproof casing, wireless charging, better battery life and more powerful optics could all be things we see and these would be amazing upgrades — old design or not — but the real headline is that this is the first iphone without a headphone jack i can say with absolute certainty that every major review of the device is going to focus substantially on this fact and thinking about it, i have to wonder: is apple making such an enormous and potentially unpopular change this year so that next years iphone — you know, the one that might have an all-glass display and an ultra-sharp amoled screen — wont suffer? thats the phone that might ditch the home button altogether its also the phone that will coincidentally be released the same year as the 10th anniversary of the original iphone and apple loves to celebrate anniversaries     a 20th anniversary edition macintosh from 1997 fun fact: this was one of the first product designs from jony ive image: christies auction house downplaying the iphone 7 so the next iphone can thrive maybe im reading too much into the tea leaves, but it strikes me that apple could be deliberately cutting the headphone jack this year — a year that is already going to be less exciting by virtue of no major redesign — in order to protect the next iphone from the inevitable backlash over the headphone jacks removal     the backlash will be angrier than when apple changed from the 30-pin connector to the lightning port yes, yes, ive been telling everyone to accept that the headphone jack is dead since january  a frequent point of discussion on our podcast, mashtalk , has been about the headphone jack and where all of us are in facing reality even tech editor pete pachal has come around to see the light the jack is dead and there will be backlash the backlash will be angrier than when apple changed from the 30-pin connector to the lightning port (making all of those old dock accessories obsolete) and the rallying cry from pundits is already louder than it was when apple decided to not include a floppy drive on the original imac i feel very certain that, backlash aside, the ultimate fallout of a headphone jack-free iphone will be minimal people will grumble adapters will be annoying and well all bitch and moan about how bluetooth just isnt good enough but well survive and within a year, most of us will be used to using either lightning headphones, dongles or snazzy wireless options well have moved on which of course, means that the buzz around the 2017 iphone will be all positive new design, new screen and some other snazzy feature but that missing headphone jack? so last years problem and thats why, the more i think about it, the more i feel like the iphone 7 has to be a little bit boring so that we can get really hyped about the next big iphone, and it needs to drop the headphone jack now, so the 10th anniversary iphone doesnt carry that particular scarlet letter despite the inevitable death of the headphone jack, im still going to buy the iphone 7 but i mostly just want to get this release over with so i can start looking forward to the iphone 8 so, i suspect, does apple

Article - at least once a day, pam retzlaff answered a call from parents concerned about her decision to allow a transgender student at edgar road elementary school to use a bathroom different from his biological gender it was hard in the beginning, very hard, she said you can imagine my first open house i had more parents in my office than ever before it was new territory for retzlaff, then principal of the school in webster groves, missouri, a st louis suburb, but it was never a question of whether she would or wouldn’t open the bathroom and as time passed, the calls slowly began to subside, going from once a day, to once a week, to once a month  that was more than two years ago – a blip in the schoolwide effort to help the soon-to-be third-grader transition as seamlessly as possible from female to male – yet still no cohesive policy exists nationwide on the issue of bathroom access for transgender students  even before controversy erupted earlier this year over new state laws limiting transgender rights, or this month’s deadly mass shooting at an lgbt nightclub in orlando, many schools across the country had taken proactive steps to make the school environment safer and more welcoming to transgender students opponents of policies that accommodate the bathroom needs of transgender students have argued that it’s an issue of safety for non-transgender students in reality, however, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students face the greater risk of harassment and assault, especially transgender students, and supporters say the bathroom discussion should be focused on protecting their safety  according to fbi statistics, more than 20 percent of reported hate crimes were attacks based on sexual orientation and gender identity – second only to race, and more than attacks based on religious bias although some state attorneys general and legislators have taken the federal government to court over its directive instructing all public school districts to allow transgender students to use restrooms that match their gender identity, school districts in those very states have quietly dealt with the issue with relative ease  and students, rather than state officials or school administrators, are often at the forefront in pushing for the change eliza byard, executive director of the gay, lesbian and straight education network, a new york-based organization that supports lgbt-inclusive policies for teachers and students, said school leaders and students live with the issue and understand it better than elected officials do if they were listening to local authorities, she said, they’d get out of the way atherton high school in louisville, kentucky, has had a policy in place for two years that allows transgender students to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity, and principal thomas aberli says there have been no problems  the most recent federal guidelines are aligned with what we’ve been doing for the past two years, aberli said in an interview despite some concerns that permitting transgender students to use the appropriate bathroom might threaten the safety and privacy of other students, aberli said that hasn’t happened at atherton we have several transgender students now, he said it’s just kind of a non-issue in march, springfield central high school in massachusetts converted two single-user faculty bathrooms into two gender-neutral bathrooms, one each for faculty and students principal thaddeus tokarz said transgender students aren’t required to use it, though some choose to do so i believe we make it a point to have them use the bathroom they feel most comfortable with, tokarz said in camas, wash, across the columbia river from portland, ore, liberty middle school principal marilyn boerke said she was prepared for an onslaught of complaints from parents in the conservative district when the school adopted its policy in 2014, but it just didn’t happen  the 770-student school allows its five or so transgender students to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity only two parents objected, boerke said in response, boerke told those parents that if their children were uncomfortable sharing a restroom with a trans student, they could opt to use another  part of that could be how our community at liberty is really all about family, she said we just don’t accept that kind of intolerance but the backlash is only beginning elsewhere in texas, lt gov dan patrick has demanded the resignation of kent scribner, fort worth’s school superintendent, over the district’s transgender-inclusive bathroom policy patrick also argued for its repeal, calling it social engineering texas is leading a multistate lawsuit in federal court against the obama administration’s policy  last month, the us department of education and the us justice department told schools across the country that title ix of a 1972 federal education law protects transgender students from discrimination based on sex, including the use of bathrooms, locker rooms and showering facilities the department reminded schools that those that did not comply with title ix requirements risked losing federal funds  in a virginia case, a federal court agreed with the federal government and sided with a transgender student who challenged his school’s policy that forces him to a bathroom that does not match his gender identity  nevertheless, texas and 10 other states sued the obama administration last month, with mississippi, kentucky and kansas later joining the effort this month, the kansas board of education voted unanimously to oppose the obama administration’s policy, though the board will allow school districts to continue policies that accommodate transgender students according to the gay, lesbian and straight education network’s 2013 school climate survey, transgender and gender-nonconforming students faced more hostility than lesbian, gay or bisexual students did four in 10 said they felt unsafe at school because of their gender expression about half reported being verbally harassed, and about 1 in 5 reported being physically assaulted the majority of students surveyed said they didn’t report the harassment or assault to school officials because of doubt the staff would do anything about it or fear that it could make things worse some schools that have accommodated transgender students say the move has improved the learning environment this was probably the best decision we made as a school all year, said kevin biggs, principal of roosevelt high school in des moines, iowa although he said students were always able to use the most appropriate bathroom for their needs, biggs said a student visited him in november and explained that some transgender students didn’t feel comfortable using the bathrooms that were available  the school created two all-gender, single-stall restrooms in february students can still choose what works best for them those little things make a huge difference in a student’s day they’re distractions that can keep students from learning to their highest possible potential, biggs said we wanted to make that possible  student alonzo hernandez, 16, helped kick-start the process of creating a multi-stalled gender-neutral bathroom at the santee education complex, a high school in los angeles, where he is a junior  hernandez is in transition from female to male, and his effort was driven, in part, by his own discomfort in using the school’s existing bathrooms he’d sometimes avoid going to the bathroom the whole day to avoid harassment there’d be times when i would personally wait in the stall to make sure everyone in the bathroom was cleared out so i could come out of the stall, he said in an interview the concerns weren’t unfounded jose lara, dean of students and faculty adviser for the los angeles school’s gay-straight alliance, said the discussion generated a small but vocal protest there were some protesters sending hate message to the students, telling them they are perverts, going to burn in hell, targeting the principal, saying he’s a pedophile, lara said but ultimately, students, teachers and parents embraced the plan the students wanted to have a voice, and they wanted to make a change, and they made a change, lara said

Article_Title - how one theory you never heard of explains everything donald trump does
Article - when donald trump declared his candidacy for president a year ago, nate silver’s fivethirtyeight political blog said he had a better chance of cameoing in another ‘home alone’ movie with macaulay culkin—or playing in the nba finals—than winning the republican nomination with a net favorability rating of -32 percent according to fivethirtyeight and exactly zero chance of winning, according to the atlantic, how has trump seemingly emerged victorious from a pool of 17 republican hopefuls? to try to answer that question would be to travel down a rabbit hole of speculation that has swallowed so many one thing is sure, though: while donald trump has thus far appeared to accomplish the impossible, even he has limits the reality is that trump—like policymakers and politicians past, present and future—is operating within the confines of the overton window of political possibility the overton window: when you think about it, it’s so true this theory, named for the late joseph p overton of the mackinac center for public policy, is a way to explain how opinions about public policies shift over time and the constraints within which policymakers operate the overton window is the spectrum of ideas that are politically palatable to voters although there is no limit to the number of policy ideas available, elected officials are limited to only actively supporting ideas within this window for example, consider federal welfare policy even though there are loads of ideas about how to address poverty in the united states, politicians support and debate only a select few, such as the minimum wage, earned income tax credit, medicaid, etc these are within the overton window other ideas, such as a guaranteed basic income, even though they may be debated in other countries and supported by economists on both the left and the right, are never seriously considered by politicians because they lie outside the window trump’s public policy, explained with this in mind, now consider trump’s recent about-face after he said the victims of the recent orlando shooting should have been permitted to carry guns into the pulse nightclub about a week after making the statement, trump appeared to backtrack and said he meant nightclub employees and guards should have been armed, not patrons this wasn’t just a flip-flop or mere pandering — it’s more likely that trump’s movement on the issue is evidence he realized his initial stance was a step outside the overton window while many of his supporters are no doubt staunch believers in the second amendment, even the nra—which endorsed him—said, no one thinks that people should go into a nightclub drinking and carrying firearms using the overton window theory to your advantage it is important to remember that politicians rarely move the window; more often than not, they only support policies that are deemed acceptable by their constituents when trump said orlando nightclub patrons should have been armed, the backlash showed him that position was outside the window, so he stepped his stance back to one more acceptable to voters the lesson in all this is that politicians, as friedrich hayek once wrote, are like corks bobbing in the sea they only go where the current leads them, and it is us — you, me and our neighbors — who determine the direction of the current in other words, if you want to see policy change—if you want to expand the overton window—appeal to the hearts and minds of your fellow citizens and the politicians will soon follow

Article - well, we all knew it was coming you can’t have a mass shooting without some political ladder-climber coming down hard on the rights of law-abiding americans and this time it is massachusetts attorney general maura healey she published this in the boston globe today the massachusetts assault weapons ban mirrors the federal ban congress allowed to expire in 2004 it prohibits the sale of specific weapons like the colt ar-15 and ak-47 and explicitly bans copies or duplicates of those weapons but gun manufacturers have taken it upon themselves to define what a copy or duplicate weapon is they market state compliant copycat versions of their assault weapons to massachusetts buyers they sell guns without a flash suppressor or folding or telescoping stock, for example, small tweaks that do nothing to limit the lethalness of the weapon that will end now on wednesday, we are sending a directive to all gun manufacturers and dealers that makes clear that the sale of these copycat assault weapons is illegal in massachusetts with this directive, we will ensure we get the full protection intended when lawmakers enacted our assault weapons ban, not the watered-down version of those protections offered by gun manufacturers the directive specifically outlines two tests to determine what constitutes a copy or duplicate of a prohibited weapon if a gun’s operating system is essentially the same as that of a banned weapon, or if the gun has components that are interchangeable with those of a banned weapon, it’s a copy or duplicate, and it is illegal assault weapons prohibited under our laws cannot be altered in any way to make their sale or possession legal in massachusetts yes, you’ve read correctly every black rifle, and all of the variants, compliant versions, and anything that any of these yokels think might be used for an assault is now strictly illegal what about all of those guns currently in the law-abiding hands of law-abiding gun owners? we recognize that most residents who purchased these guns in the past believed they were doing so legally, so this directive will not apply to possession of guns purchased before wednesday in the dozen years since the federal assault weapons ban lapsed, only seven states have instituted their own assault weapons ban many of those bans have been challenged (unsuccessfully) by the gun industry, and we anticipate our directive may be too but our job is to enforce state laws and to keep people safe this directive does both right because the criminals who are shooting up campuses and theaters and police protests–they’re all easily stopped by enacting a simple bit of legislation i could tell you just how many mass murders were thwarted when the perpetrator ran up against a law like this, but i wouldn’t want to let the wind out of the ag’s sail in the face of utter inaction by congress, states have a duty to enact and enforce laws that protect people from gun violence if washington won’t use its power to get these guns off our streets, we will not only do we have the legal authority to do so, we have a moral obligation to do so wait–to get the guns off the street? i thought she’d just said it was legal to own them if you’d bought them before wednesday now she’s got a moral obligation to get them off our streets if i were in massachusetts, i’d be feeling a bit paranoid right now what does the state consider an assault weapon? assault weapon, shall have the same meaning as a semiautomatic assault weapon as defined in the federal public safety and recreational firearms use protection act, 18 usc section 921(a)(30) as appearing in such section on september 13, 1994, and shall include, but not be limited to, any of the weapons, or copies or duplicates of the weapons, of any caliber, known as: (i) avtomat kalashnikov (ak) (all models); (ii) action arms israeli military industries uzi and galil; (iii) beretta ar70 (sc-70); (iv) colt ar-15; (v) fabrique national fn/fal, fn/lar and fnc; (vi) swd m-10, m-11, m-11/9 and m-12; (vi) steyr aug; (vii) intratec tec-9, tec-dc9 and tec-22; and (viii) revolving cylinder shotguns, such as, or similar to, the street sweeper and striker 12; provided, however, that the term assault weapon shall not include: (i) any of the weapons, or replicas or duplicates of such weapons, specified in appendix a to 18 usc section 922 as appearing in such appendix on september 13, 1994, as such weapons were manufactured on october 1, 1993; (ii) any weapon that is operated by manual bolt, pump, lever or slide action; (iii) any weapon that has been rendered permanently inoperable or otherwise rendered permanently unable to be designated a semiautomatic assault weapon; (iv) any weapon that was manufactured prior to the year 1899; (v) any weapon that is an antique or relic, theatrical prop or other weapon that is not capable of firing a projectile and which is not intended for use as a functional weapon and cannot be readily modified through a combination of available parts into an operable assault weapon; (vi) any semiautomatic rifle that cannot accept a detachable magazine that holds more than five rounds of ammunition; or (vii) any semiautomatic shotgun that cannot hold more than five rounds of ammunition in a fixed or detachable magazine time for some crafty legal eagles to start dismantling this gibberish

Article_Title - is there really a 2 billion-year-old nuclear reactor in africa?
Article - an ancient nuclear reactor that was churning away 2 billion years ago sounds like a myth maybe its because the term reactor usually implies a manmade structure but in this case, the reactor is a region of natural uranium within the earths crust, found in okla, gabon uranium is naturally radioactive, and the conditions in this rocky area happened to be just right to cook up some nuclear reactions the natural reactor must have annoyed nuclear scientists: the first nuclear reactor to produce electricity started up in 1951, and this only produced a trivial amount of energy the pile of rock in the ground in okla, on the other hand, created nuclear power around 2 billion years ago! it was discovered in 1972, when some french scientists took uranium ore from the mine in gabon to test its uranium content typically, uranium ore is made up of three types (isotopes) of uranium, each one with a different number of neutrons: uranium 238, which is the most abundant, uranium 234, which is the rarest, and uranium 235, which nuclear scientists are most interested in because it can sustain nuclear chain reactions one would expect to find that the uranium ore is composed of 0720% uranium 235, since that is the percentage found in other rock samples from the earths crust, the moon and even meteorites however, these french scientists found something fishy: the uranium sample only contained 0717% of uranium 235 what might seem to be a minor discrepancy of 0003% is very significant with regards to uranium that meant that, back at the mine, around 200 kilograms (around 440 pounds) of uranium 235 appeared to be missing it hadnt been lost or stolen instead, this missing 0003% had undergone nuclear fission and split into other atoms this conclusion may very well have furrowed some brows since there are three very specific conditions that a reactor needs to churn out energy continuously and as even scientists had struggled to create a nuclear reactor, it seemed unlikely that nature just happened to create one purely by accident unlikely, but not impossible, because that is exactly what happened the conditions that the natural reactor happened to fulfill are as follows the first was owning a good percentage of uranium 235 to fuel the reaction while 0720% might seem small, its perfect for nuclear fission, and when the ore samples from okla are compared to other samples from all over the world, it is likely that this was the percentage over 2 billion years ago when the reactor started the second condition is a source of neutrons uranium 235 decays naturally into thorium and releases a neutron in the process this neutron can then whoosh towards another uranium 235 atom and start the fission process nuclear fission is when an atom breaks apart into smaller atoms, usually releasing energy in the process this neutron fuses with a uranium 235, and together they combine to form uranium 236, which is unstable the uranium 236 is then overwhelmed with instability and splits, creating a variety of smaller, stable atoms and some neutrons these neutrons can then happily shoot towards other atoms and continue the chain reaction the nuclear reactor had a supply of a regulating substance as well: a flow of natural groundwater as the atoms started to split, they released neutrons as well as energy the water would slow down the neutrons, but the energy would heat up the water after a time, the water would get so hot that it would start to boil off eventually, enough of the water would have boiled away until there wasnt enough left in the reactor to slow down the neutrons the neutrons started shooting off into the ground without reacting with anything, and the reaction would stop then, the natural flow of groundwater would trickle in until there was enough water to start the whole process again this watery cycle probably continued for hundreds of thousands of years sadly, all good days are numbered, even for a happy natural reactor: the levels of uranium 235 got used up and the level was too low to sustain any more meaningful reactions the reactor eventually slowed to a stop, leaving only a few traces behind that it ever existed – including the enigma of the missing uranium featured image: danilo russo/flickr source: naturally occurring nuclear fission

Article_Title - digital immortality: how technology will bring loved ones back to life
Article - the theory that humans will eventually be able to upload our brains to computers has fascinated futurists and neuroscientists for years by transferring our minds into machines we could live forever, unmoored from the feebleness of our physical bodies the concepts of death and bereavement as we know them now would cease to exist currently the idea lives within whitepapers and sci-fi movies, and the only thing (most) researchers agree on is that it wont be possible for a really long time but while were far from achieving that pinnacle of immorality, technology in the here-and-now has already started giving us a sliver of eternal life while shaping how we grieve our loved ones if and when they die the silicon valley-startup eternime aims to let people preserve their most important thoughts, stories, and memories in an artificially intelligent system that could ultimately communicate conversationally with others once its creator is gone such an avatar could both soothe the bereaved and allow future generations to know much more about their great-great-grandparents since the company had a splashy launch two years ago it has progressed with crypt-like quietness their site is mostly unchanged, save for the counter of people signed up for early access that rises each day but now it says it plans to launch revamped version of its app to a test group in early 2017 the app will connect to a persons facebook account (with other social integration planned) and launch micro-conversations based on their daily activities ultimately that process will build the ais understanding of its subject, and be able to function like a smarter, more personalized version of the chatbots you can already interact with today we chose this approach because we would like to help people solve the blank page syndrome we have often seen when somebody tries to write in their diary, explains eternime founder marius ursache we want to encourage people to start curating their digital legacy and we will do that by triggering conversations based on previously collected data of what they did, felt, or experienced though eternimes new app will be collecting all this information, the neural network backbone wont be able to turn that mass of unruly data into engaging conversations yet the artificial intelligence that we need requires a lot of effort and time — it may take years, ursache says a lot of the people who expressed interest in eternime dont have this time this forces us to use more or less the the approach of the cryonics initiatives — preservation first, technology second meanwhile, a semblance of the companys vision has already come to life earlier this year, entrepreneur eugenia kudya created an ai-powered chatbot in honor of her friend roman mazurenko, who died tragically in 2015 kudya and other mourners could speak with roman by talking to the bot or asking it questions — its responses would be based on the thousands of texts messages and photos she had fed the neural network controlling its artificial intelligence while the roman bot couldnt narrate stories in the same way that eternime envisions, it wrote in his voice talking to the bot helped kudya grieve and made her feel more connected to her friend inspired by the personal conversations that other people had with romans bot, shes now working on replika, a new product that, like eternime, will collect a persons stories and memories and learn to mimic their conversational mannerisms by texting with them the bot would first ask you about the past and eventually prod you about your daily life your friends could talk to your replika, too, asking it personal questions or using it to schedule plans with the real you its all about making people a little bit more open about themselves  a little more vulnerable, kudya says now even the first replikas we have on the app can tell you a lot about the person that trained it the goal of the platform, she explains, isnt to let everyone create their own roman that will live on after they die, but to give everyone a kind of friend that is there every day to talk to, to make you more connected with your friends and yourself but intention or not, a persons replika bot would be able to keep responding like you and telling your stories after you died in the same way that eternimes avatars could over 100,000 people have reserved their replika name and 17,000 applied for early testing of the app, but only 1,200 were given access to the beta version kudya was vague about when she thinks the technology will actually be good enough for the general public the natural progression of eternime or replikas ideas would be to combine the ai with realistic digital 3d avatars (something eternime eventually plans to do to, but has back-burnered while it works on the first part of its mission) facebook is researching how to create life-like virtual reality avatars as are a host of different startups, including one called xxarray that explicitly envisions helping people create a digital legacy long-time vr researcher jacki morie coined the phrase the ultimate selfie to describe how she predicts that current technologies could eventually combine to create digital avatars that would not only would look like us, but move like us, and learn from us, too she imagines that in the not-so-distant future, when using an avatar in vr is fairly common practice, people will be able to train a digital surrogate that could live on after theyre gone youll be scanned and have this 3d construct that can then walk around in virtual worlds and it will retain the things that you did within an ai, she says this kind of avatar could become a repository for our experiences and our memories while the idea of talking to a dead relative through a digitized ghost may seem creepy — edging into bizarre uncanny valley territory — experts say that, on principle, its actually a completely natural progression of the way that people have always grieved heather servaty-seib, a grief researcher and purdue professor says that its in line with the continuing bonds theory of bereavement death changes the form of your relationship with someone, not the fact that you have one many already talk to the dead through a smartphone screen instead of at a graveyard (or through a phone booth, like in otsuchi, japan where tsunami survivors call their lost loved ones) facebook allows people to memorialize the pages of the deceased and those pages often become a public and wide-reaching digital wake where friends and family share photos, memories, or their messages to the dead aftertalk prompts the bereaved to write letters to their loved ones that can either be private or shared with a therapist or family member deadsocial allows users to set up a curated facebook-page of sorts where their love ones can commune once theyve passed they can even choose to schedule personal messages that will send from beyond the grave if people have always found ways now to talk to the dead, could it be problematic if they start talking back? both servaty-seib and grief therapist dr bob neymeyer agree that new ways to communicate with the dead could be healthy for many patients still, there are some potential pratfalls related to how we mourn it could be damaging to children, who generally dont fully grasp the concept of death, servaty-seib says or it could be addictive to people already prone to focusing too much on the dead, deemphasizing other relationships and not moving forward, says neymeyer hes had patients who have listened to the deads voicemail over and over or spent days on end at their grave now imagine if someone had an extensive, almost inexhaustible archive of conversation available with the deceased, he says beyond the psychological implications, palliative care doctor mark taubert says that he doesnt think that it will be technically feasible for the tech to answer the kinds of burning questions people will have for their digitized loved ones i often find that the questions a grieving friend or relative may have for the deceased are often quite difficult to answer, for example, did you ever forgive me for what i did in ? he says how could an artificially intelligent system taught simply to mimic your style and echo your memories tackle that difficult question in any real way? digital legacy tools like eternime or deathlogic dont just serve the people left behind they are very, very much about the person who is dying or thinking about their own eventual death

Article - breast cancer rates on the rise among black women though the reason is unknown, researchers say breast cancer rates increased 02 percent among black women but remained stable among whites between 2006 and 2010, the latest time period assessed historically, white women have had the highest breast cancer incidence rates among women aged 40 years and older, and they still do with about 127 cases per 100,000 compared with 118 cases per 100,000 black women however, incidence rates are now converging among white and african-american women, particularly among those aged 50 years to 59 years although the incidence havent declined, we have made strides in the effort to improve the survival rate death rates have declined by 34 percent since 1990 however, not all ethnic groups are enjoying this improved survival, dr stephanie bernik, chief of surgical oncology at lenox hill hospital in new york city, told healthday  breast cancer death rates have dropped by 34 percent since 1990 in all racial/ethnic groups except american indians/alaska natives, while african-american women continue to have the poorest breast cancer survival of any racial/ethnic group in june, a jama study showed that black women are less likely to survive a breast cancer diagnosis within five years because they undergo fewer screenings, have poorer health at the time of diagnosis and have more advanced disease by the time the cancer is found authors of of the acs report also noted that reproductive history and obesity are more strongly linked to er-positive breast cancer, the form of the disease more common among white women, while lower socioeconomic status has been linked to raised risk for er-negative breast cancer, which is more common among african americans

off on an international trip to catch the pokémon elsewhere in the world — underwritten by an international travel company marriott rewards has offered to sponsor johnson to go to europe, japan and australia to catch the regionally based pokémon and finish his collection, he told usa today friday a marriott spokesman confirmed the trip ​using gps and augmented reality, the game developed by niantic labs invites players to catch the colorful pokémon monsters best known from nintendo games and trading cards of the 1990s in the game, the monsters appear on real-life sidewalks and park benches when a player has the app open — a scenario thats encouraged a mass public-walking binge by millions i feel great, johnson said i was getting a lot of rest and exercise and meeting new people i’m a lot healthier — i think i lost about 8-10 pounds launched in early july , the hardcore users are now looking for the rare pokémon mr mime , farfetchd and kangaskhan are reportedly only available in the wild in europe, asia and australiasia, respectively however, it is rumored these pokemon can be hatched from rare eggs in north america that users can pick up at pokestops i’ve talked to dozens and dozens of people who have hatched 100s of eggs and no one can hatch or catch them (in north america) as far as i know, johnson said the brooklyn-based tech worker announced this week he had nabbed the 142 local monsters on reddit with a screenshot of his pokedex, and later confirmed this feat to business insider he owes his new fame to plain old shoe leather central park  many times they would get to know fellow pokémon trainers (players) searching in the park and then they would wait for the top or the bottom of the hour when pokémon tend to spawn after getting off at work around 6:00 pm at applico, a platform innovation company , johnson would meet up with his girlfriend, have dinner and then together head down to pokémon hotspots such as grand army plaza in many times they would get to know fellow pokémon trainers (players) searching in the park and then they would wait for the top or the bottom of the hour when pokémon tend to spawn if she decided to leave before him, he said she would give him her phone to help her collect more monsters and he usually found himself heading home around 12 am or 1 pm, the normal time he goes to sleep johnsons iphone health app stated he has walked an average of 8 miles per day since the game was released on july 6th johnson said that he had a couple of nights, when he got around the 135 pokémon mark, that kept him out till 2 am to 5 am this trainers solution: heavy doses of black tea in the morning even so, he said he doesnt feel like the game affected his professional life, stating that pokémon go is a gaming platform and he works for a platform innovation company, so he felt like the game translated back into the work he did everyday hes even recently co-authored a book about the platform business model he said his passion for platforms like these are a big part of what motivated him to play the game as much as he did beside growing up playing the pokémon games, of course but staying out till 5 am isnt what johnson considers to be the most drastic measure he took for pokémon, citing a story of trying to catch a porygon he said when he noticed there was one close-by, he went to search for it, but the pokémon go radar was down so he had to order an uber drive to drive him around until he eventually found it that is above and beyond anything else i did to catch one, johnson said i was close to the end so it was extra motivation as for other fellow trainers hoping to catch them all, his first piece of advice is to talk to trainers for tips on where to find certain pokémon i probably wouldn’t be here, having caught them all, if i hadnt got those great tips like the dratinis in jersey city, johnson said secondly, always make sure you walk in a straight line when trying to hatch an egg because the game uses a distance displacement calculation so walking in circles or zigzags wont do you any good i learned that the hard way, johnson said for now, hes playing casually as something fun to do with his girlfriend and friends but is pouring his energy back into applico at least for now until he takes his international pokémon catching trip my childhood dreams of being a pokémon master have come true

Article - look at a photo of a street scene from the 70s or early 80s, and a lot of things look pretty much the same as today most of the buildings are similar peoples clothes, on the whole, arent all that different, give or take a few shoulder pads one thing stands out: all of the cars look super boxy, especially compared with the curving, rounded exteriors of virtually every car on the market today this underappreciated transformation is probably the most distinct design change to come to cars over the past half-century, and for most us cars, it happened within just a few years, starting in 1986 you can even pinpoint the exact year curves arrived for some models — like the buick lesabre, which had much harder edges along its hood, roof, and trunk in 1991 (left) than 1992 (right): in the decades since, cars have just gotten curvier and curvier why the big shift? it turns out it was largely due to three interrelated factors: european style trends, a government-mandated push for fuel economy, and new technologies that allowed manufacturers to more easily design and create curved shapes it all started with european luxury designs by the 1980s, making curved cars wasnt an entirely novel idea — it had just largely gone out of fashion among us automakers the streamliners of the 1930s, such as the chrysler airflow, had a sleek look designed to minimize wind resistance but the airflow and other streamlined american models were commercial failures, outsold by bigger, boxier cars through the 1970s, almost every american-made car had hard, sharp edges, with few curves they were uniformly designed as a series of three connected boxes: the hood, the cabin, and the trunk in europe, though, fuel was always more expensive, and designers — especially in germany — explored aerodynamic designs much earlier on, says penny sparke, author of a century of car design in the 1960s and 70s, luxury automakers like porsche, bmw, audi, and mercedes-benz were some of the first to reintroduce curved exteriors one of the earliest, most well-known examples is the porsche 911, which was pretty curvy way back when it was introduced in 1963: this aesthetic eventually became associated with these luxury cars, both in europe and in the us, where they arrived as imports and inevitably, writes historian david gartman in auto opium: a social history of american automobile design, american automakers began to copy the european aerodynamic aesthetic in the mid-1980s as a way of courting upscale consumers ford, more than any other company, was responsible for bringing this design change to the mass market designer uwe bahnsen did it first in europe with the 1982 ford sierra, which was far more curved than similar cars of its era: reviewers panned the look (nicknaming it the jelly mould), and the car did not sell well at first over time, though, buyers got used it — especially as other manufacturers eventually copied the style for their own cars in the us, ford designer jack telnack — whod worked on the companys european design team before taking over north american design in 1980 — was most directly responsible for the shift to curves his 1983 ford thunderbird design was heavily shaped by wind tunnel testing, prioritizing aerodynamic lines the look soon filtered down to the mass market with the 1986 taurus: it might look unremarkable today, but the design was positively futuristic at the time the car was even used in the movie robocop, which was supposed to take place in the near future the taurus, writes gartman, was definitely aiming at the upscale market of young, well-educated buyers to whom the bmw appealed the strategy worked the taurus was a huge hit, with massive sales that saved the struggling company — and inspired a wave of copycat american cars automakers had to improve fuel economy part of the reason the curvy look proliferated so quickly and is still with us today is basic physics curved exteriors and more steeply pitched windshields make for less wind resistance, as air can flow more easily over them this means less gas has to be burned to move the car the same distance at the same speed right as the taurus premiered, automakers were dealing with corporate average fuel economy standards for the first time starting in 1978, the average fuel economy of each manufacturers passenger car fleet sold in the us had to reach higher and higher levels, before plateauing in 1990 at 275 miles per gallon while automakers had already achieved some gains in efficiency with improved engines and other components, the new curved aesthetic made it much easier and cheaper to achieve further improvements one ford designer claimed that while it would cost $200 to $300 million to achieve a one-tenth-mile-per-gallon increase by engineering under the hood, aero design achieved a three- to four-tenths mpg increase for almost nothing, gartman writes automakers began relying more heavily on wind tunnels and aerodynamic calculations when designing their cars, and engineers started working more closely with designers within just a few years, virtually every car on the market suddenly looked like the once-futuristic taurus they all looked the same because they were all being shaped in the wind tunnel, and were designed for fuel economy, says larry edsall, the author of several books on car design history technology made it easier to produce curves a few key technological developments made these designs possible — and have since allowed automakers to make their cars curvier and curvier for decades, designers had made car models using clay, wood, or other physical materials during the 1980s, they began using computer models its much easier to make these sorts of shapes with computer drawings, rather than wood, sparke says they gave automakers the means to produce those very soft curves manufacturing technologies also made it easier and cheaper to produce curved shapes in aluminum than before as a result, since that initial shift in the 1990s, exteriors have only become curvier you can get a good sense of how profound the change has been by looking at a newer car thought to be remarkably boxy: the scion xb sure, it has a big, blocky hatchback but its edges are still way more rounded than the truly boxy cars of the 80s — and even the groundbreaking, futuristic 1986 ford

Article - the good news is that a male venture capitalist thinks he has an innovative new solution to solve the gender gap in tech the bad news is that it involves women pretending that they are men in a column in the wall street journal, john greathouse of rincon venture partners outlined his belief that women will get more opportunities in tech if they create an online presence that obscures their gender bizarrely equating hiring practices in tech to blind orchestra auditions, greathouse suggested that women do things like only use their first initial and eliminate photos on both twitter and linkedin rather than call on tech companies to overcome the unconscious bias that can too easily be baked into hiring practices, greathouse thinks women should solve the problem themselves by hiding who they really are [the column] made me really mad said angela dalton , a managing director at guggenheim it’s wrong on so many levels it perpetuates the trap that women fall into that if i put my head down and just work, i will get noticed success is competency, yes, but it’s also personality and warmth i sat down with dalton as well as three other female investors for a panel discussion today at tap , a tech conference in new york the topic of our chat was the future of mobile investing, but with the industry abuzz with disbelief about the column, our conversation inevitably changed direction [greathouse did not respond to an email i sent him requesting comment in a tweet, he apologized for the column] heidi roizen , an operating partner at dfj, said that when she started in venture capital, she was routinely the only woman in the room after becoming aware of the gender bias that pervades the tech industry, roizen decided to give her two children gender-neutral names that way when their applied to jobs later in life, the recruiter wouldn’t know if they were male or female this is sad, but it is also true, said roizen yes we did to change things, but we need to recognize the reality for what it is nimi katragadda , a principal at boxgroup, agreed with roizen that you can’t ignore the problem, but said that hiding your identity entirely to overcome bias was asinine’ advice why should you hide your identity because the person on the other end of the table is backwards? she said you are making the problem worse that way the fact that all the investors on stage for my panel were women was not an accident in fact, the conference organizers were trying to combat the gender gap in tech by doing the exact opposite of what greathouse suggested after having a difficult time recruiting female speakers for last year’s conference -- a problem that plagues most tech events -- the organizers intentionally set out with the goal of having more than 50% female speakers highlighting female voices was the conference’s way of signaling to leaders in the room that diversity in leadership roles should be a priority we know that companies that have diverse teams do better, said susanne greenfield , a director at priceline group but there is this unconscious bias people want to hire and promote people who are similar to them you have to do something to fight that bias as a linkedin editor, i regularly work with thought leaders in tech who share their insights on our publishing platform rather than encourage female writers to mask their identity and experiences, i suggest they own it in order to combat the misguided notion that the tech industry is only comprised of male leaders, women must share their expertise on social networks so that audiences hear a diverse set of perspectives to get more women interested in pursuing careers in technology, current female leaders must continue to strive to be seen, rather than hide like greathouse suggests

Article - scores of psychological studies suggest that, for guys, attractiveness isnt just about the way you look from being a talented musician to walking a dog, there are plenty of traits and behaviors that can amp up your sex appeal to women — especially if youre looking to land a long-term relationship a growing body of research on romantic attraction has focused on the importance of altruism: men who display helping behaviors are generally perceived as more attractive than those who dont in a 2013 study on the topic, researchers had young, heterosexual men and women rate pictures of other men and women on how attractive they would be for short- and long-term relationships some of the people pictured were said to engage in altruistic behaviors, such as volunteering at a homeless shelter other people pictured were described in neutral ways, such as loves chinese food both men and women rated the altruistic people as more attractive for long-term relationships — but women showed a stronger preference for altruism than men did more recent research suggests that altruism could be even more appealing than good looks in a study published this year, researchers looked exclusively at heterosexual womens preferences for attractiveness and altruism in men about 200 women were asked to look at photographs of mens faces half those faces had been determined to be extremely physically attractive; the other half had been determined to be extremely physically unattractive the women saw two pairs of faces at a time, one attractive and one unattractive each pair of faces was displayed alongside a description of a scenario and how each man behaved for example: two people are walking through a busy town and see a homeless person sitting near a cafe one man goes into the cafe and buys a sandwich and tea for the homeless person; the other man pretends to use his cellphone and walks straight past the homeless person all the women were asked to rate each man on how attractive he was for a short- or long-term relationship the researchers walked away with several key findings first, as previous research had found, altruistic men were more attractive than nonaltruistic men second, altruistic men were more attractive for long-term than short-term relationships when it came to short-term relationships, nonaltruistic men were in fact more desirable than altruistic men perhaps the most striking finding was that altruism appeared to be even more appealing than physical attractiveness when it came to long-term relationships unattractive men high in altruism were rated more attractive for long-term relationships than attractive men low in altruism its hard to say whether these study findings apply to real-life interactions but they do suggest that, if youre a man looking for a committed relationship with a woman, you shouldnt hesitate to flaunt the fact that youre an unpaid mentor for elementary-school kids or that you help your elderly neighbor buy groceries every week it could be an easy way to gain an edge over the more self-oriented guys out there

Article - protecting the world’s endangered species from poachers is dangerous business over the past decade, more than 1,000 rangers have died in the line of duty, according to statistics released last week for world ranger day some deaths were caused by accidents or animals most, however, were murders committed by heavily armed poachers who enter national parks and other protected areas in search of species such as tigers, rhinos, and elephants at the same time, rangers have killed hundreds of poachers, often spurred by the shoot on sight policies that have become the norm in several parks the numbers add up: between 2011 and 2015, rangers at south africa’s kruger national park alone reportedly killed nearly 500 poachers while these rangers are undoubtedly heroes who all too often lay down their lives to protect the animals in their care, some organizations have begun to raise questions about the retaliatory bloodshed, asking if it is ethical or moral for rangers to kill suspected poachers without arrest or trial the issue came to bear most recently last month after a guard in india’s kaziranga national park, which has a shoot-to-kill policy, critically wounded a seven-year-old boy from a tribe that lives around the park we’re pretty horrified by the situation, said sophie grig, senior campaigner at survival international, a tribal rights organization that has criticized the recent kaziranga shooting and shoot-to-kill policies in general it seems to us a very worrying trend that is bad for both local people who get caught in the crossfire and for conservation grig also wonders if shooting poachers even solves the larger problem if you were arresting those people and then investigating them, you could trace back and work out who the kingpins are, she said if you shoot them dead, you can’t ask them any questions annette hübschle, who recently authored a report on rhino poaching for the global initiative against transnational organized crime, echoed those sentiments she said the current militarized approach is pushing people away from any chance they might have to participate in conservation there should be a greater focus on investigating the transporters and buyers, prosecuting organized criminals such as kingpins and smugglers, ‘follow the money’ approaches, and seizing assets of criminals, she said aside from legal strategies, the issue of whether or not poachers should be killed brings up several potential lines of ethical thought, said anna peterson, a professor in the department of religion at the university of florida and the author of being animal: beasts and boundaries in nature ethics one way of thinking about it, she said, is to ask if individual sentient beings have value and if there is a difference in that value between a human life and that of a rhinoceros she pointed to ethicist tom regan’s test, which asked if you would throw a dog out of a lifeboat to save yourself essentially, regan said you would always throw out the dog on the basis of complexity and what would be lost by a human’s death rather than a dog’s death, she said more broadly, peterson said, you could ask if a species is rare and significant and if its ecosystem would suffer in its absence this ecological perspective could come into play when discussing species such as rhinos, tigers, and elephants we have that debate here about florida panthers, which are both rare and important predators, she said finally, peterson looked at the question from the field of ethics known as war theory the just war theory, she said, lays out a series of criteria, such as do you have a just cause and have you tried to fix this peacefully? if we consider preserving ecosystems to be a just cause, then killing could be justified similarly, so could looking at poaching as an economic issue, as it threatens tourism, or as a national security issue, an important consideration involving organized crime, smuggling, national borders, and related crimes such as drugs and weapons no one has easy answers rangers are doing difficult jobs in difficult circumstances, grig said she added, though, that the often public enthusiasm for killing poachers seems contrary to the call to protect human rights in just about any other crime i think this is something we need to be discussing, she said

Article - it’s an experience many shoppers have had: you’re queued in line at the store prepared to make a purchase only to have your credit card declined for no apparent reason a perfectly legitimate charge has been flagged as fraudulent, and the result is an agitated customer and a retailer with unsold merchandise mastercard has now turned to artificial intelligence to better differentiate between real and mistaken fraud, hoping to tamp down on the former while allowing the latter to go through it’s the latest financial services company to see the potential for the burgeoning field of machine learning to improve security on its network and enhance the customer experience financial institutions have for years collected data on customers’ habits and routines, and used the information to pinpoint cards that may have been compromised that’s the reason your card may be declined if you make an unusually large purchase, shop at a store for the first time, or buy gas in a place far from home the system is essentially deciding whether that behavior seems normal according to predetermined questions, then accepting or declining the purchase based on its decision the old method was using tests and thresholds and other sorts of rules with a rules-based approach, you get a tremendous amount of false positives, said todd marlin, a principal in ernst & young’s forensic technology and discovery services practice what we’re seeing is sort of a gold rush into artificial intelligence, marlin said machine learning can help fraud-detection systems become smarter about what fraud actually looks like, both across the network and on an individual level for example, the system might detect that you haven’t shopped at a particular merchant in the past, but still accept the purchase because customers with a similar spending history shop there often or perhaps you travel to a certain state or country often enough that the system learns purchases there are likely to be legitimate citing a survey from javelin advisory services, mastercard estimates that $118 billion in sales were declined due to falsely identified fraud in the united states in 2014 — well more than the $9 billion lost to actual instances of fraud that’s a large sum of money that retailers — and credit card purveyors like mastercard — could be pocketing mastercard’s new decision intelligence software pulls in data, sometimes hundreds of pieces of data, about a specific transaction at the moment a customer swipes his or her credit card the system then combines all of that information to yield a score indicating how likely the transaction is to be fraudulent each score builds on the one before it and informs the one after it such that the computer’s algorithm gets better at detecting fraud without a programmer having to engineer every change the company called it the first use of ai being implemented on a global scale directly on the mastercard network for this to work we need all kinds of data coming in, said ajay bhalla, the president of enterprise risk and security at mastercard we’ve been working on a strategy of getting more data points into the network we see this as a critical component of our future strategy, bhalla added we are embedding ai in everything we’re looking at as a company for the last decade, visa has deployed its visa advanced authorization system to detect fraud the volume of data and the speed at which it’s processed have increased considerably over that time, said mark nelsen, the company’s senior vice president of risk products and business intelligence visa parses through those large sets of data to discern what characteristics distinguish legitimate and fraudulent spending, and then uses those characteristics to assess the veracity of future purchases we can look at that transaction and, knowing what we’ve seen in the past, we can predict if this is going to be good or bad, nelsen said digital payment platforms are also embracing machine learning, though fraud remains more difficult to detect in online or mobile commerce paypal has developed its own artificial intelligence software to combat fraud, allowing the company to move from a system that can analyze tens of data points to one that can analyze thousands there’s a magnitude of difference — you’ll be able to analyze a lot more information and identify patterns that are a lot more sophisticated, paypal’s senior director of global risk and data sciences, hui wang, told american banker but visa, mastercard and paypal have the financial heft and risk appetite to explore artificial intelligence in ways that smaller and more regional players in the financial services industry do not, said celent analyst arin ray while most in the industry think ai holds promise, there remain questions about how it will impact regulatory compliance and that makes some hesitant to embrace the technology, according to a report ray co-authored in august the concept of ai has been there for 50 years, but it really has had a rebirth of sorts in the last three or four years the volume of data has grown exponentially in recent times, so there is definitely the need for tools to [analyze it], ray said in an interview one [concern] is how this technology will impact their existing operations since it’s still unproven technology, they don’t want to take that risk if they have to make major changes to their existing infrastructure, he said

Article - if you were an american man working full-time in 1984, you earned, on average, a bit more than $22 an hour (adjusted for inflation to 2014 dollars) if you were particularly ambitious, or particularly in need of cash, you could make more money by working more hours, but on a per-hour basis, you’d still be making about the same — a bit more than $22 per hour fast-forward to 2015, though, and the picture looks a lot different the average man working a typical full-time job, 35 to 49 hours a week, now earns about $26 an hour but the man working 50 hours a week or more now earns close to $33 an hour hourly pay has risen more than twice as fast over the past three decades for men working long hours, as employers increasingly reward employees willing to work extra hours with raises or promotions (the pattern crosses educational and industry lines, and holds when excluding overtime pay) notice that i said men men make up a bit more than half the full-time workforce, but they account for more than 70 percent of those working 50 hours a week or more so as wage gains have gone disproportionately to people working long hours, they have also gone disproportionately to men, widening the earnings divide between men and women overall the gender wage gap has narrowed significantly over the past 50 years in 1964, according to data from the census bureau, the typical woman working full time made about 59 cents on the dollar earned by a man; by 2004, that had risen to 77 cents (these calculations don’t take into account differences in experience, industry or other factors) more recently, however, progress for women has nearly stalled out: in 2014, the latest data available, women earned 79 cents for every dollar earned by men, a 2-pennies-an-hour improvement over a decade other measures of women’s progress in the workforce — their rate of employment, the likelihood that they will work in a historically male-dominated field, the rate at which they run big companies — show a similar pattern of what researchers martha j bailey and thomas a diprete, in a new essay, call five decades of remarkable but slowing change for american women bailey and diprete’s essay serves as the introduction to a remarkable new collection of papers from the russell sage foundation that examines the progress that women have — and haven’t — made over the past half-century it isn’t a simple story the us has already made major, albeit incomplete, progress on many of the most obvious causes of gender inequality — explicit discrimination on pay, overt barriers to employment, taboos against working while raising children what is left is a tangle of cultural norms, implicit biases, individual preferences and other, subtler forms of discrimination that are much harder to change or even to measure take the long-hours anecdote i described above the rapid rise in pay for people working long hours has played a major role in the persistence of the overall gender wage gap, particularly for parents; new research in the russell sage foundation volume estimates that the wage gap between mothers and fathers would be 15 percent smaller if the extra-hours increase hadn’t occurred but that premium itself isn’t the result of discrimination, explicit or implicit; women who work long hours have seen even faster gains than men (although they still earn less on average) rather, the trend contributes to the wage gap because men are so much more likely than women to work those long hours that, in turn, is the result of a confluence of factors that are deeply embedded in the american economy and society: women, on average, spend much more time than men on housework, while men — especially a certain category of highly educated, elite men — are expected to work as much as possible and of course, most importantly, mothers are still far more likely than fathers to be the primary caregiver for their children government policies could make a difference — affordable child care, for example, could make it easier for women who want to work long hours to do so — but they can only go so far the russell sage foundation papers are full of such thorny issues a rising share of the gender wage gap is driven by pre-market factors such as choice of industry and occupation; those issues can also be the result of explicit or implicit discrimination but are much harder to address than wage differentials within a given job and even forces that should help close the gap, such as education, have proved insufficient: women have for decades been more likely to attend college than men — there are now for the first time more female than male college graduates — yet the pay gap is widest among the most educated workers girls now outperform boys in many science and math subjects in high school, but women are still much less likely than men to work in many of the most lucrative technical fields; women have actually lost ground to men in computer science in recent decades and the overall rate of occupational desegregation — women entering traditionally male-dominated fields and vice versa — has slowed there are some encouraging signs for women those who do go into science and technology fields earn nearly as much as equally experienced men (though that isn’t true in computer science), suggesting the overall wage gap would narrow if more women entered so-called stem fields moreover, the motherhood penalty — the relative decline in wages for women when they have children — has disappeared or even reversed for highly paid, highly educated women, perhaps because they are the most likely to have access to (and be able to afford) child care that suggests that making child care more widely available could help narrow the gender pay gap for less-educated women, too — something that is looking more likely now that both major presidential candidates are advocating affordable-child-care plans culture is changing, too: men are taking on a larger share of child-rearing responsibilities, though the division is still far from equal still, the overall picture painted by the russell sage foundation research is one of slow, grinding and unsteady progress, and of barriers that are hard to define and even harder to resolve hillary clinton may be poised to crack the ultimate glass ceiling, but true gender equality remains a long way off the olympic tax speaking of high-earning (and high-flying) women, the internet was abuzz this week with stories about the hefty tax bill that gymnast simone biles and other olympic medalists will face when they get back from rio the bbc estimated biles will owe more than $40,000 a bipartisan bill to exempt olympic winnings from taxes is gaining momentum in congress but the whole issue is getting blown out of proportion the us olympics committee awards bonuses to american medal winners: $25,000 for gold medals and smaller amounts for silver and bronze biles, with her five medals, will receive $110,000, which in theory could put her on the hook for more than $40,000 in taxes (the medals themselves are also taxable, but their actual value is modest) but it’s unlikely she’ll actually owe that much because biles and other olympians can deduct the cost of their training on their taxes and in the case of high-profile olympians such as biles and swimmer michael phelps, their actual winnings are dwarfed by far more lucrative (and very much taxable) endorsement deals by the time biles cashes all those checks from procter & gamble, her olympic tax bill will probably look like a rounding error the fed newly released minutes from the federal reserve’s july meeting this week suggest that board chair janet yellen and her colleagues are still weighing whether to raise interest rates in september or wait until the economy improves further separate comments from key fed officials this week indicated that new data since the fed’s meeting hasn’t resolved the question the fed is in a tricky spot the job market continues to show strength; may’s weak employment report looks more and more like a blip but overall economic growth has been disappointing, and there have been recent signs that consumer spending — a key pillar of strength in recent months — is beginning to weaken then there is the election, which complicates the fed’s task in two ways: policymakers don’t want to intervene too close to the election, lest they appear to be trying to influence the outcome, and they also have to grapple with the possibility that the election itself, and the uncertainty around it, will affect the economy most economists still think the fed will wait until after the election is over to raise rates number of the week back in july, i wrote about the long-term decline in teen summer employment, particularly among lower-income youths a report from the bureau of labor statistics this week indicates the recovery is gradually reversing that decline: 532 percent of americans ages 16 to 24 had jobs in july, up from 527 percent last year and 507 percent in 2013 the report didn’t break out teens specifically, but a look at the underlying data shows that the employment rate for teens rose, too moreover, the employment gap between low-income and more affluent teens narrowed somewhat, the latest sign that the improving economy is gradually benefiting the most vulnerable workers

Article - ann coulter can’t stop raging against hispanic voters the conservative pundit blasted house republicans as sell outs in a column on wednesday for crafting guidelines on immigration that would create a mechanism to grant legal status to undocumented immigrants, saying that the growing latino population will wreck the country leave aside the harm cheap labor being dumped on the country does to the millions of unemployed americans, coulter writes what does it mean for the republican party? casting aside conventional wisdom, coulter says that embracing immigration reform would make the republican party lose voters she argues that latinos and other immigrant groups, particularly asians, are so liberal on issues including obamacare, gun control and the role of government that they’ll never vote in large numbers for republicans coulter refuses to acknowledge public opinion on the immigration issue, writing: the only ones opposed to our current immigration policies are the people in fact, polls routinely show that a majority of americans support immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented -- a more liberal stance than the one released this week by house republicans, which would only create a pathway to legal residence to back her assertions, coulter cites a study by phyllis schlafly, a fellow conservative pundit who has called on the republicans to keep their party as white as possible coulter violated the embargo on the study, writing that it was too important to wait the study was not provided in the column, so it’s not clear what new information it contained coulter writes that the study brings together several different previously released surveys by pew, gallup, latino decisions, and other pollsters showing that immigrants and latinos tend to lean more liberal than the average us citizen the people that republicans ought to reach out to are white voters, schlaflly said last year during an appearance on conservative radio show focus today there is not any evidence at all that these hispanics coming in from mexico will vote republican actually, there is former president george w bush pulled 44 percent of the latino vote in 2004 avoiding the approach advocated by folks like coulter or schlafly, he spoke some spanish, supported immigration reform and refrained from ranting against latinos during interviews with the media many observers have concluded that the republican party would perform better among latinos if it moderated the intransigent stance on immigration adopted by hardliners like coulter instead, coulter has argued since barack obama’s reelection as president in november that republicans should ignore the country’s largest ethnic minority altogether

Article_Title - why a south carolina man got bail after he shot, buried and ‘slow-cooked’ two people
Article - early in the morning on march 5, james edward loftis found himself facing two men in his south carolina home the men were demanding cab fare for the ride loftis had just received i’ll get your money, he told them, according to his own account given to police and recorded in an arrest warrant soon after instead, the warrant said, loftis retrieved a 45-caliber semi-automatic handgun, returned to the living room and fired off eight shots, striking both men he then went to get gas, cleaned his home with bleach and burned the two bodies, along with his clothes and towels, in the back yard, according to the document on monday, his lawyer argued that loftis acted in self-defense and buried and burned the bodies in a state of panic, on monday, his lawyer argued that loftis acted in self-defense and buried and burned the bodies in a state of panic, according to the post and courier  a prosecutor said the prosecution was moving forward in its case against loftis nonetheless, a judge in the case granted bail to the 39-year-old, who faces murder charges for fatally shooting the cab driver, 46-year-old guma oz dubar, and the other man, 32-year-old james cody newland he’s a human being, defense attorney stephen harris said, according to the post and courier he freaked out and thought he was going to prison, so he tried to hide the bodies nobody knows how you’re going to react when you kill two people harris said what loftis did after the shooting was heinous, according to the post and courier berkeley county deputy solicitor bryan alfaro said the prosecution would continue pursuing the case, given loftis’s inconsistent accounts of whether the men forced their way into the home or whether he let them in — a crucial part of his defense, according to the post and courier, because of south carolina’s stand your ground law, which grants protection to homeowners who use deadly force against intruders stand-your-ground laws have sparked national debate, especially in the years following the 2012 shooting death of an unarmed african american teenager in florida an attorney for george zimmerman did not invoke it as part of his legal defense, although a member of the jury later told cnn that they had weighed florida’s stand-your-ground law before finding zimmerman not guilty in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old trayvon martin gun rights advocates say such laws codify the right to protect one’s home, while opponents say they legalize the sometimes-deadly use of force on monday, alfaro, the deputy solicitor, depicted loftis’s actions in gruesome detail they were essentially just slow-cooked inside the grave site, he said following the brutal events that early-march morning, loftis did not call police his wife did wilda loftis told the authorities that her husband was having suicidal thoughts and had told her that he had killed them and put them in the back yard, according to the original arrest-warrant affidavit after police arrived, she showed them bullet holes in the living room, above the couch investigators made their way to the backyard and discovered a disturbed patch of dirt then, they spoke to loftis, who explained what happened if and when loftis posts his $250,000 bail — probably this week, the post and courier reported — he will be on house arrest, allowed only to leave for work, church, or visits with a doctor or his lawyer, according to the post and courier

Article_Title - trumps order on abortion policy: what does it mean?
Article - a group of men standing around a desk: it is not the typical image that goes viral online the photograph in question was taken on us president donald trumps first day in the oval office on monday, when he signed a ban on federal money going to international groups that perform or provide information on abortions men making decisions about womens bodies was a much-repeated phrase on twitter, as it was shared hundreds of thousands of times, including by author jk rowling the concern over lack of women at the table comes as mr trumps cabinet attracts attention for the high proportion of white, male nominations and while some people welcomed the move on abortion, others on social media expressed alarm and confusion over what its impact could be viral images and headlines do not always tell the whole story so here is an at-a-glance look at what president trumps executive order means is this a step towards banning abortion in the us? not in itself this particular executive order is relevant outside of us borders the policy requires non-governmental organisations receiving federal funding to agree to neither perform nor actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations this particularly worries womens rights campaigners in developing countries, where funds or facilities are already limited although this policy does not directly affect services in the us, mr trump has said he supports an abortion ban at home his signing of this order as one of his first executive actions indicates he still sees the issue as a priority is president trump the first to introduce a ban on foreign funding? republicans and democrats have been involved in a political tug-of-war over the issue for decades republican president ronald reagan first created the mexico city policy in 1984, stopping funding for international groups which perform or provide information on abortions but democrats later rescinded it under the clinton administration it was reinstated when president george w bush took over in 2001 and overturned again by president barack obama in 2009 and now it is back what has all this got to do with mexico city? the orders official name is the mexico city policy because president reagan first implemented it at a united nations population conference in mexico city and why is it sometimes nicknamed the global gag law? critics of the policy say organisations working around the world feel censored by it because they cannot offer women full advice on family planning if they flout the rules, they lose funding which, in some cases, could threaten certain projects or the whole organisation however, pro-life groups have welcomed the new administrations swift move president trumps immediate action to promote respect for all human life, including vulnerable unborn children abroad, as well as conscience rights, sends a strong signal about his administrations pro-life priorities, said marjorie dannenfelser, president of us pro-life organisation susan anthony list is it unusual to have so many men at the table? no like many governmental decisions, the rules on abortion are often determined by male officials many on social media were quick to point out that the 1973 roe v wade ruling - seen as a landmark case for abortion rights in the us - was delivered by an all-male supreme court the roe v wade decision says abortion is legal until a foetus is viable, typically between 22 and 24 weeks what are mr trumps views on abortion? the new us president has previously changed his mind on the issue he has gone from being pro-choice in 1999 to being against abortion today, although he says he would allow exceptions such as in the case of rape or incest on the presidential campaign trail, he said he believed some form of punishment should be in place for women who have abortions, if the practice is banned but, after strong criticism, he released a statement saying that only the doctor or practitioner should be punished, not the woman in an interview with cbs news, mr trump said: the laws are set and i think we have to leave it that way he refused to say whether he believed abortion was murder, but he later conceded that he could not disagree with the statement

Article - dont panic, but scientists have stumbled across a new substance that may be the deadliest known to man a new variant of botulinum toxin, type h is so dangerous that researchers have decided to withhold publishing information about it, over concern it could be used as a bioweapon new scientist reported that inhaling just 13 billionths of a gram of the stuff, or an injection of just 2 billionths of a gram, could kill an adult yikes this is not the usual process for publishing manuscripts, dr david hooper, an editor at the journal of infectious diseases, told npr we thought in this case an exception was appropriate clostridium botulinum, the bacterium that produces the toxic protein, is found in soil once ingested, the protein acts as a neurotoxin and can cause a life-threatening paralytic illness known as botulism c botulinum has long been known to produce the highly dangerous toxins, giving scientists time to develop antitoxins with which to treat them but h type, the first new botulinum protein discovered in more than 40 years, is untreatable fortunately, the likelihood of an average person randomly encountering the new toxin is exceedingly small, hooper told the huffington post via email dr david a relman, a professor of medicine at stanford, wrote in an editorial commentary accompanying the initial report, until [a type h] antitoxin can be created, shown to be effective, and deployed, both the strain itself and the [dna] sequence of this toxin  pose serious risks to public health because of the unusually severe, widespread harm that could result from misuse of either seven other known strains of the bacterium, labeled after the first seven letters of the alphabet, a - g, are treatable, and only four of them -- a, b, e, and f -- are actually toxic to humans of course, c botulinum also has useful applications, ranging from neuromuscular treatments to botox for skin wrinkles

Article - time for your weekly edition of the deadspin funbag got something on your mind? email the funbag today, we’re covering egg whites, sex, cats that do dishes, and more i took my family on a short road trip for spring break, and on the way home, my 2-year-old asked me to pull over so he could go take a crap so i did i pulled into the gas station, and then my wife brought the kid to the bathroom, and he announced that he was bluffing he did not have to take a shit so he got back in the car, and we drove for another 30 minutes, and then he announced, for a second time, that he had to go poop you’re not lying this time, are you? i asked him if you’re lying, i’ll never stop for you to poop again but he said he had really had to go, so i pull over, and it’s the same thing he was either lying or he got stage fright in the mcdonald’s can so my wife puts him back in the car, and we get stuck in traffic on the beltway just as we’re getting home i think you know where this is going once again, the boy screamed out that he had to poop i told him he could hold it until we got home then he started clutching at his tummy and crying out to pull over i don’t think he’s lying this time, my wife said but i swear to you, we were just a mile from home at that point and the beltway is one of those horrible roads that offers very little in the way of ideal places to pull over home was the only logical destination for him to go void his bowels so i told him he had to hold on jussssst a minute longer begged him, really sponsored on the exit ramp, he suddenly stopped crying and i knew why i could hear him exhaling forcefully kids don’t hide that sort of thing we pulled into the driveway (not before hitting every light on the way there), and my wife rushed the boy into the house and into the bathroom green shit was caked on his legs it was everywhere some of it fell out of his pants (how?) and landed on the front stoop it was terrifying anyway, that’s parenting in a nutshell for you you take every precaution possible, and you still end up with green shit all over the place now, your letters: dan: i don’t know if this is a good question, because i doubt there’s any kind of satisfying answer to it but why do no nfl teams seem to care that jameis winston maybe raped a girl? the mock drafts all have him going at no 1 or 2 (most say no 1) how the fuck?! especially in light of the year the nfl has just had (and goodell’s publicity push for an end to violence towards women), would it be that crazy to suggest that nfl teams won’t want to risk spending their first-round pick on someone who many people believe has a capacity for actual evil? even if he never raped anyone, he has shown he’s a liability, at best, with the crab-legs thing and the fuck her right in the pussy thing how are bucky brooks and daniel jeremiah not even hedging their bets at this stage? i’m sure last year they talked ad fucking nauseum about johnny manziel’s partying and how that would affect his draft stock how does rape not??? why aren’t they even mentioning it? i think you’re wildly overgeneralizing to say teams don’t care of course they care you’d care if you were the gm who decided to risk his job by investing the no 1 pick in a seafood thief and alleged rapist but the bucs desperately need a qb (or else everyone gets fired anyway), so they’re probably best off drafting winston and then throwing out a bunch of some bullshit spiel to peter king about how they had private eyes talk to over 75 people about winston in studying him for the draft that strikes me as an obvious ass-covering move so they can draft winston, and then, if he fucks up, they can be like, don’t blame us! we talked to 75 whole people about him! they just want to make sure he doesn’t commit any future rapes and if he does, they want to make sure that they can blame winston and winston alone for it but it is strange that, in the public scouting process, winston’s past has been reduced to a handful of convenient euphemisms like immaturity and shit like that look at lovie smith gush about winston, even though he can’t possibly know him all that well: to me, i think he’s told us an awful lot with how he’s handled it, smith said it’s not like he’s getting ready to go into the nfl and scrutiny is coming his way he’s gone through it a couple years now, and he’s answered the bell that’s what you have to do you have to have tunnel vision and do your job looking from the outside, that’s what he’s been able to do i mean, that’s a hell of a way to twist a rape allegation into a positive look at him shake off defenders and circuit court judges with such ease! the fact that winston was never formally charged with rape, and the fact that the nfl and their broadcast partners probably have a great many lawyers who would prefer that the word rape not be thrown around when addressing winston, is all smith needs to sell you on the idea of drafting him  to concoct a narrative of an ambitious young man looking to redeem himself as a way of cleverly masking the fact that the bucs have an urgent, raw football need to fill, and they have little choice but to fill it with a guy who might be the scum of the fucking earth that’s why winston’s rape allegations haven’t necessarily affected his draft stock the way johnny manziel’s drinking did it’s because nfl teams think that winston is simply a better player if neither player had baggage going into the draft, winston would be taken before manziel every time that’s the reason the browns are ready to give up on manziel already it’s not the boozing it’s the fact that they don’t think the little fucker can play the nfl can chirp all they like about domestic violence and doing the right thing, but the bottom line is that the majority of their employees must win in order to keep their jobs, and that means they must place a bloodless premium on talent than the nfl would rather not acknowledge as still existing they constantly want to sell you on character or on potential character instead if jameis is gonna go no 1 no matter what, the nfl has no choice but to hold their noses and make it look like they didn’t willingly crown a psychopath prince of the draft you know what’s funny about all this? winston was awful last season, and i’m not talking about just his yakety sax play in the rose bowl he threw 18 picks last season against horrible, piddly-shit acc teams but scouts, for some reason, seem to be far more impressed by the fact that winston staged a number of winning comebacks that were necessitated almost exclusively because of his own boneheaded mistakes if you look the part, and you’ve got the arm, and you have that subjective mix of football iq and magical qb unicorn leadership skills, scouts will happily overlook all those turnovers and the rape stuff it’s quite something (by the way, superfuck jaws and mike mayock for their little mariota’s on top of my board now! spiel this week jaws is an empty-headed attention whore who will say basically anything and the only reason certain football fans enjoy mayock is because they haven’t learned to be sick of him yet) kyle: are big egg and big nutrition teaming up to push the egg white agenda? you have to have roughly double the egg whites to get the same amount of food, thus causing an increase in egg consumption i’m suspicious of the whole thing but the yolk has all the cholesterol! if you simply throw out the yolk, and then add bacon, ham, and cheese to your omelet, it can’t hurt you at all! that’s science i used to be huge on egg whites true story: in college, i would go to the dining hall, toast a bagel, grab a couple of hard-boiled eggs, remove the yolks, and then mush the whites onto the bagel and eat a sad egg-white bagel sandwich that way i thought this was a healthy lunch, conveniently ignoring the whole eating a whole bagel part of the enterprise sometimes i ate two in one sitting do not do this the truth is that egg whites are one of those foods you eat so that you can eat more food i hate small portions, so if i eat a 12-pound egg-white omelet, i feel like i just got away with something but in general, this is untrue you need portion control in your life, which means you should just splurge and eat the goddamn yolk anyway the yolk is the best part all golden and runny and seeping into the toast nooks  i could a 50-egg omelet i swear there are never enough eggs in the omelet for me why are eggs so small? i need eggs to be triple their current size i don’t like cracking so many of them i am not a crackpot danny: if tomorrow, you could appoint any current non-politician in america as the potus for the next eight years, who do you think would do the best job?

she says that summer is better because the heat makes it feel that much more steamy, summer bodies are great, and you can get fully nude without having to keep any layers on because of the cold i say fuck that september is the most common birth month in the united states, which means that we americans seem to prefer fucking in the winter, if only because there’s nothing else to do personally, i prefer summer i don’t want to worry about having to cover up all the sexy business with a comforter because everyone in the bed is colder than shit in january i want everything out in the open i want to be hot and sweaty and horny and dying to rip off my sexy striped polo shirt just for you, baby i want the covers off and the lights on and i want to see everything i need good material for when i’m alone summer is sexier tell them, y&t! halftime! william: would you rather have a dog that folds laundry, or a cat that does dishes? the dog, i guess my preference for dogs over cats is greater than my hatred for doing dishes over folding laundry, so there you have it doing dishes blows, but folding laundry is also horrible it’s 8:30 pm, and the kids are finally asleep ,and i’m just about ready to settle into the recliner when i see that fucking laundry basket filled to the brim over in the corner, and it never ceases to make my blood boil fuck that laundry i should only have to fold my clothes my clothes are big and sparse and easy to fold my laundry is awesome my wife should thank me for never wearing more than one pair of pants in a week corey: let’s say all members of the beatles and nwa are magically revived and/or returned to their artistic primes the beatles then have to go into the studio and record an album of nwa’s best hits, and vice versa which album ends up sounding better?

beyoncé could have the top 20 songwriters writing at all times, and the top producers and editors working year-round like christmas elves the masses never tire of pop music, so why not put out an album a month? because that’s too much product! even the nuttiest white-girl beyoncé fans would get sick of her if she put out 120 songs a year you can’t keep up with that kind of catalog those songs can’t all be great even if they were, you’d still grade them on a curve and have certain hits in your mind that would make your permanent rotation, with everything else falling by the wayside that’s easy to do now back in day, when i had to listen to tapes, i usually listened to all the songs on the album because i was too lazy to fast forward i heard back off bitch by gnr far more times than anyone should have to endure not their best work i don’t have to do that anymore technology has made me a supremely lazy music fan it’s just not possible to absorb that much music from one artist, no matter how hard you try ever have your favorite artist put out a double album? it’s a complete pain in the ass i need you to go away for a while so that i can grow to love you again whenever an artist says that they had 60 tracks to choose from or whatever for a single album, i can promise you that you never want to hear the 50 tracks they threw away half of those tracks are just the guy freestyling on the bongos while high on acid kevin: so i’m getting married in a month, and my fiancé and i are closing on a house next week instead of some over-the-top bachelor party, i am asking that my friends just help me move my friends feel that this is selfish, and i’m taking advantage of them we’re moving from a 1,000-square-foot apartment into a three-bedroom house it’s not like we have a ton of stuff the plan was that i rent the truck, and we move everything saturday morning, and then grill steaks and get drunk saturday night in the new house i think that this is way better than asking everyone to kick in hundreds of dollars to go golfing for a weekend or whatever; it’s my bachelor party, and i should be able to do what i want, right? but that’s not a party you’re asking for free manual labor instead that doesn’t count as a celebration, you monster if i threw a party, and everyone came, and then i was like, hey guys, this is a laundry folding party! now fold my laundry and i’ll get takeout! all my friends would have me killed you can’t do that if you want to ask your friends to help you move, that’s fine but you can’t apply that to your party credit do the move yourself, and then have the bachelor-party cookout afterward, without putting any work obligations on your friends steve: this actually happened close to six years ago, but it remains a contentious issue amongst our group of friends five of us were on a road trip from montreal to boston, rotating drivers evenly as one does on longish road trips as we got close to boston, the friend driving the last leg got pulled over for speeding since we were in college at the time, the $200+ ticket was nothing to sneeze at (who are we kidding? it’s still a lot of damn money) the issue was — does the ticket get split amongst the group, or paid solely by the driver? the four of us who drove first say no, since we drove our portion without incident the friend who got slapped with the bill argues that since the last leg was the toughest, and we were trying to get to our destination by a certain time, and nobody complained about his speed until the blue and whites started flashing, that we should split the ticket who is right? the last leg was the toughest? why? were there dragons lining the highway? your friend was driving, and thus he’s responsible for his own driving behavior, even if he had shit luck he pays the ticket if another friend riding in the car wants to pitch in, fine but that guy shouldn’t expect it these kids today never want to take responsibility smdh! i went to a basketball game last week, and i had an uber take me home, only the uber guy got a parking ticket outside the arena while he was waiting for me and i felt bad that he got the ticket, so when the ride ended, i gave him $20 in cash extra and that, of course, made me feel all generous and kind yes america, i helped pay a full one-tenth of that poor bastard’s ticket while exploiting regulation loopholes that force working-class people to act as private chauffeurs to uppity white dipshits with smartphones medal of honor for me, pleeeeeeez but screw your friend tom: where would the most opportune time/place for aliens to land to get the biggest initial audience, but not get shot out of the sky? the white house lawn would be a great spot, but they would have several fighter jets shooting at them before they land; a random field would have no one around i feel the best bet is a major sporting event that doesn’t have dedicated aerial security what do you think? all major sporting events have (in theory) patrolled airspace i would just vote for the sheep meadow in central park, dead center of manhattan news crews could get there quickly crowds would form roasted-nut vendors would make a killing and new yorkers would instantly try to take ownership of the first contact experience you guys don’t get these aliens it’s a new york thing actually, now that i think about it, let’s choose any large park space in any other city because central park is a complete fucking pain in the ass it’s hot and overcrowded, and there’s horseshit everywhere if aliens landed there, four million people would converge on the spot, and then i wouldn’t be able to get a good view, and the subways would be jammed, and i would just say fuck it and then go home and watch the aliens on tv instead mike: how does robocop poop?

what would his twitter handle be? would he put a picture and bio, or just keep the egg there like a weirdo? there are calls for obama’s impeachment and resignation on a daily basis right now, so i assume a @luther account would only amplify those daily complaints more like marco boob-io, amirite?! that tweet would probably help fill up a news cycle or two before everyone stopped giving a shit i don’t think he’d actually resign, though after all, plenty of politicians out there already use twitter for trolling purposes and we live in age where you can survive pretty much any scandal so long as you’re willing to sit there and ride it out you let 200 million people take a dump on your face for a week, nod politely, and then everything is back to normal i do think he’d have a picture and bio for his troll account, tho the obama machine knows too much about the internet to let that slide email of the week! ape chemist: suppose during the first round of the nfl draft, the camera cuts to a player talking on his cell phone and smiling and celebrating with his family and friends this all takes place while the team is on the clock, so goodell has yet to announce the pick while celebrating, the player—like lamarr houston or bill gramatica—tears his acl assume the team hasn’t officially announced the pick does the nfl let the team withdraw the pick? i remember when the vikings had to pass on a pick because they didn’t get their card in on time, so i could absolutely see some team arguing the pick wasn’t official until the card is turned in and read i hope this happens to some team like the cowboys, and jerry sends someone onstage to tackle goodell before he reaches the podium i might be wrong, but i think once you turn the card in, the pick is final no backsies, even if it hasn’t been formally announced if you haven’t turned the card in but glory boy decided to tear his knee up anyway, then fuck him switch it and draft todd gurley instead but once the ginger hammer has that card, you cannot bend his iron will drew magary writes for deadspin he’s also a correspondent for gq follow him on twitter @drewmagary and email him at drew@deadspincom you can also order drew’s book, someone could get hurt, through his homepage

Article - here’s a sample interaction between the chatbot and a student (courtesy ashok goel) to help with his class this spring, a georgia tech professor hired jill watson, a teaching assistant unlike any other in the world throughout the semester, she answered questions online for students, relieving the professor’s overworked teaching staff but, in fact, jill watson was an artificial intelligence bot ashok goel, a computer science professor, did not reveal watson’s true identity to students until after they’d turned in their final exams students were amazed i feel like i am part of history because of jill and this class! wrote one in the class’s online forum just when i wanted to nominate jill watson as an outstanding ta in the cios survey! said another now goel is forming a business to bring the chatbot to the wider world of education while he doesn’t foresee the chatbot replacing teaching assistants or professors, he expects the chatbot’s question-answering abilities to be an invaluable asset for massive online open courses, where students often drop out and generally don’t receive the chance to engage with a human instructor with more human-like interaction, goel expects online learning could become more appealing to students and lead to better educational outcomes to me this is a grand challenge, goel said education is such a huge priority for the entire human race at the start of this semester goel provided his students with a list of nine teaching assistants, including jill, the automated question and answering service goel developed with the help of some of his students and ibm goel and his teaching assistants receive more than 10,000 questions a semester from students on the course’s online forum sometimes the same questions are asked again and again last spring he began to wonder if he could automate the burden of answering so many repetitive questions as goel looked for a technology that could help, he settled on ibm watson, which he had used for several other projects watson, an artificial intelligence system, was designed to answer questions, so it seemed like a strong fit to train the system to answer questions correctly, goel fed it forum posts from the class’s previous semesters this gave jill an extensive background in common questions and how they should be answered goel tested the system privately for months, having his teaching assistants examine whether jill’s answers were correct initially the system struggled with similar questions such as where can i find assignment two? and when is assignment two due? goel tweaked the software, adding more layers of decision-making to it eventually jill reached the point where its answers were good enough i cannot create chaos in my classroom jill had to be almost perfect as a human ta or i am, goel said the system is only allowed to answer questions if it calculates that it is 97 percent or more confident in its answer goel found that was the threshold at which he could guarantee the system was accurate there are many questions jill can’t handle those questions were reserved for human teaching assistants goel plans to use jill again in a class this fall, but will likely change its name so students have the challenge of guessing which teaching assistant isn’t human

rubio has a script for this question climate change legislation hurts the economy it hurts the economy and has no real impact on the environment the better approach is to support innovators of american energy i say, ok, if we pass this bill how many feet of sea rise will it prevent? he explained, reasonably, as he has on this and many other occasions well, it wont prevent any sea rise ok, well how many degrees of temperature will it avoid going up? well, it wont do that either but afterwards, capt dan professed to be happy with rubios response last time i heard him say it, which just happened to be in manchester two days ago, he said it was too expensive, too difficult, wait this time he started to look to the side a little bit, see a different way to see it possibly so reframing climate change as a family issue, not an environmental one, could certainly cause rubio some cognitive dissonance very possibly that could be the conscious intent of folksy capt dan, who traveled all the way to new hampshire because this is such an intimate state where i have access to all the candidateswhere i can ask the questions i want to ask folksy capt dan kipnis, who traveled all the way to new hampshire on the dime of a climate change organization capt dan kipnis, member of the miami-dade county climate change advisory task force capt dan kipnis, director-at-large, florida wildlife federation capt dan kipnis, adviser to former vice president al gore capt dan kipnis, who has been trying to bring marco rubio to the climate change table for nearly 10 years now as the pancake-less attendees exited the school cafeteria, merrills very strong ground game was in action two young rubio volunteers tried to nail down the vote, asking attendees to sign an i pledge to vote for rubio the responses: im not from here no, new york im from out of state were from connecticut we just came up from massachusetts thank you for making the drive, one volunteer repeatedly responded it grew a little wearying nobody is, he started, and then corrected himself, there are a few people from new hampshire watching from a ledge behind him was kaity thomson, a recent university of new hampshire graduate, whod come to hear rubio with her co-worker and friend yuxi wang we were expecting pancakes, said thomson, who is now working for 350org, the international environmental citizens pressure group its crazy thomson, still undecided, did come away with something she could believe in, though: the visiting captains story  i think it was really moving and inspiring

Article - all this isn’t to suggest that americans never mark veterans day and memorial day in communities across the country, members of the military, members of government, and military families gather on both holidays to raise and lower flags, decorate graves, and participate in processions and parades on memorial day, some people observe the national one-minute moment of remembrance at 3 pm, which was passed into law by congress in 2000 observation of the moment is left up to participating organizations, such as amtrak and major league baseball and, as in the uk and canada, the veterans of foreign wars (vfw) distributes poppies on veterans day and memorial day so that people can publicly commemorate the fallen the numbers don’t lie, though: according to the vfw, only 9 million poppies will be distributed in the us (population: 316 million) this year by comparison, 45 million poppies will be distributed in the uk (population: 64 million) for armistice day, according to the royal british legion why doesn’t the united states have a common culture of commemoration? one potential explanation lies in the fact that the us hasn’t recently experienced the kind of generational destruction that, say, the first and second world wars brought to britain and russia, respectively britain lost approximately 2 percent of its population in the great war, resulting in a lost generation jay winter of yale university told me that those men left behind  a void, an absence, a black hole in the center of thousands of families defined in part by who wasn’t there the soviet union suffered an even more dramatic loss in the second world war—amounting to roughly 15 percent of its population by comparison, us losses in the second world war constituted about 03 percent of the population, and 01 percent in the first world war the only american war that incurred such steep losses was the civil war, in which 2 percent of the population perished it should come as no surprise, then, that the trauma of that conflict led to the establishment of decoration day, the precursor of memorial day differences in how military holidays are observed can’t be reduced to a numbers game, though in the united states, at least, they may also stem from a strain of american thinking that highlights historical triumphs and skips over what those triumphs have cost lindsey tepe of the new america foundation, for instance, has written about the ways in which public education has become a battleground between those who view american history as a sweeping tale filled with  grand heroes, epic battles, and the continuing struggle for the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and those who recognize that american history is also full of inconvenient truths  and the injustices perpetrated throughout the course of building this nation winter argues that what makes us commemoration different is the emphasis on redemption in american narratives of war in the uk, on the other hand, the absence of the lost generation mattered more when america’s national mythology and political discourse preach a tale of endless victory and exceptionalism, there is less of an incentive to focus on those men and women who didn’t come home from battle what makes us commemoration different is the emphasis on redemption in its narratives of war the finer details make a difference as well joe davis, director of public affairs at the vfw, believes the all-volunteer force, established in 1973, drove a wedge between the military community and an ever-growing civilian population during the second world war, the united states fielded a conscription-based military of approximately 16 million people, out of a population of 135 million today, the professional military is well below its troop level during world war ii, and the us population has more than doubled in the interim davis also cited as a factor the shifting of memorial day from its original, fixed date of may 30 to the last monday of may when you link a military holiday to a three-day weekend, you lose the meaning of the day, davis told me whatever the explanation, the lack of an appropriate occasion to commemorate america’s war casualties has been noted from 1989 until his passing in 2012, senator daniel inouye of hawaii, a world war ii veteran, repeatedly introduced resolutions to return memorial day to its traditional date—and, by proxy, its original intent separately, two bills have been introduced in congress in the last two years alone—one to establish two minutes of silence on veterans day, the other to do the same on memorial day neither bill has been passed, although the one for veterans day has since been revised as an amendment to the national defense authorization act the timing of these bills is opportune judging by recent polls, the american public is war-weary and largely of the view that the wars in iraq and afghanistan were failures a debate is also underway about what america’s global role should be, with many americans leaning toward isolationism (despite a surge of support for a more muscular us foreign policy following isis’s beheading of american journalists) in this environment, it would be worthwhile to rigorously observe a moment in which americans collectively acknowledge the good that their country has done in the world—and the real, human costs that have accompanied that involvement

Article_Title - when’s the best time to share on facebook?
Article - there’s all manner of advice and guidance on the web for online publishers looking to optimize their social media efforts coschedule, fast company, hubspot, shortstack, forbes, hootsuite, quicksprout and others all claim to have the answers to such seemingly simple questions as when is the best time to post on facebook? and how often should you post stories on facebook? however, many of the strategies used by publishers for optimizing engagement and boosting referral traffic from social are flawed using data from leading publishers, we will dispel the myths and demonstrate that there are no universal best times to share content on facebook we analyzed the median traffic that articles received from facebook three hours after they were shared using the median for all stories and a year’s worth of data helped ensure the analysis wasn’t skewed by outliers our analysis garnered some fascinating discoveries firstly, when we compared three major publishers of national and international news based in south america, france and the uk, we found significant variance in the shape of the traffic profiles for each publisher as can be seen in the above chart, the south american publisher achieved best performance when sharing between 11am and 4pm, and poor performance at other times the british and french publishers, meanwhile, achieved more consistent results throughout the day, although both experienced peaks in referral traffic at different times it’s clear there is no one-size-fits-all approach for publishers, even if they are in the same category — optimal times vary depending on the location of the audience one explanation for this could be that daily routines and behaviors vary between countries and cultures, which therefore impacts media consumption patterns the natural next question is whether there are country-wide best times for posting stories on facebook could it be that readers in france all consume content more consistently throughout the day than the south americans? can there be specific guides per country? we compared traffic data from that same french news publisher with a top-10 french sports publisher of similar size and found that while before 10am they achieved similar results, the curves then diverge by early afternoon, the news publisher is enjoying a strong peak in traffic, whilst the sports publisher is in a pronounced trough overall, the sports publisher’s traffic is more consistent, with fewer dramatic peaks and troughs, while the news publisher has clearly demarked periods when more readers are clicking through to their stories even for two publications of equivalent size working in the same country, there are stark differences in audience behavior depending on the subject matter of the content we also compared two similar publications in the same country and looked at the traffic profiles of two top-10 french news publishers there were still crucial differences — when one publisher experienced a peak in share performance at 11am, it is in fact one of the worst times for the other publisher to be sharing interestingly, there also seems to be significant variance based on article topic we looked at 220,000 facebook posts made by our publisher clients between march 20 and july 10, 2016, and sorted them according to the time of day at which they were shared we then compared performance of posts based on whether the articles were about sports or technology all shares were obtained using local time, in order to compensate for time zone differences, then normalized by average client performance and volume again, there are important differences, and these nuances help us understand the characteristics of audiences and their varying appetite for particular content types at different times of the day but even these descriptions of the individual publishers do not do the subtlety of the data justice to get the most accurate picture, a publisher would need to perform this analysis again on a real-time basis due to strong daily fluctuations indeed this is why many publishers now commit very significant resource to optimizing their performance — with large social media teams and even data scientists featured image: nick shepherd/getty images

Article - the rio 2016 summer olympic games is being billed as the biggest sporting event on the planet it’s difficult to argue against that claim as more than 11,000 athletes will be competing in 28 sports and 42 disciplines for the event’s ultimate prize: the gold medal the podium value of the gold medal at the rio 2016 olympics is approximately $564 , based on the price of gold at $4376 per gram and the price of sterling silver at 61 cents per gram, as of thursday this is in line with the 2014 sochi winter olympic games (about $566, even though that medal was 31 grams heavier) however, it is a long way off from the approximate $708 record price of the 2012 london gold medal, due to the record high price of gold and silver at the time if the entire medal was made of gold it would be valued at nearly $22,000, which is why 1912 was the last time all-gold medals were awarded a total of 2,488 medals were produced for the rio 2016 olympics (812 gold, 812 silver and 864 bronze) by the mint of brazil all of the medals are the same size and weight, with a diameter of 85 millimeters and a weight of 500 grams, making them the heaviest medals in the history of the summer olympics and tied for the largest medal in the summer games at least three winter olympic medals were larger and heavier each of the 812 olympic gold medals is plated with six grams of gold (the minimum required by the international olympic committee) with 999 percent purity the remaining 494 grams is made of silver with 925 percent purity (the standard for sterling silver), according to the mint of brazil the purity silver standard also is a minimum ioc requirement each of the 812 silver medals contains 500 grams of sterling silver the podium value is about $305 the 864 bronze medals contain 475 grams of copper (95%) and 25 grams of zinc (5%) the bronze medals have little intrinsic value for the first time in history, according to rio olympic officials, the medals are designed in a curved dome-shape, higher in the center, so the thickness ranges from 6 mm to 11 mm sustainable design the medals were produced with methods that the rio 2016 olympic officials described as symbols of sustainability and accessibility  more than 30 percent of the silver used in the production of the medals are recycled from mirrors, waste solders and x-ray plates the gold is mined entirely free of mercury more than 40 percent of the copper used in the production of the bronze medals came from the industrial waste of the mint of brazil through a process that was developed internally even the ribbons attached to the medals were well thought out with half of the materials woven from recycled polyester polyethylene terephthalate (pet) yarn (recycled post consumer polyester made from bottles) each medal comes with a sustainably sourced wooden box, certified by the forest stewardship council, that contains a miniature sculpture of the rio 2016 logo the front of each medal has the rio 2016 logo framed by laurel leaves (which were given as awards for the ancient olympics) the reverse reveals the traditional etching of , the greek goddess of victory, in the foreground and the greek panathnaic stadium in the background above nike is the engraving of xxxi olympiad and the olympic rings adding a personal touch, the name of the event in which the medal was awarded is engraved by laser along its outer edge paralympic medals with new sound innovation the 2,642 paralympic award medals were made by the mint of brazil and are of the same weight, dimensions and materials as the olympic medals the design is highlighted by a trail of seeds that wraps from the front to the reverse side of the medal olympic officials say the seeds represent the courage, persistence and development of athletes the rio 2016 paralympic games logo is on both sides of the medal, with braille inscriptions on the front side for the first time the medals come with sound, so visually impaired athletes can identify the medal’s color  metal ball bearings were placed inside the medals which rattle when shaken the gold medal makes the loudest noise and the bronze the weakest more than 100 employees in various professional fields—including, art, sustainability, engineering and production—were involved in the making of the 5,130 medals anthony demarco is founder of the jewelry news network please join me on the jewelry news network facebook page, twitter @jewelrynewsnet and instagram @jewelrynewsnetwork

Article_Title - ""chewbacca mom"" shares the real reason her video blew up the internet
Article - in the age of viral media, it’s not uncommon for a video to go crazy viral or a post to been seen by millions of eyes in fact, never before in history has someone had the ability to be plucked from obscurity and rise to a national — or international — platform as quickly as in this 21st century digital age we see it all the time: from the announcement of sarah palin as a running mate in 2008; thrusting her into the spotlight from obscurity, to the boy who cried damn daniel on vine and ended up on the ellen show and just about everywhere else it’s surprisingly easy to make a name for yourself and garner 15 minutes of fame the newest member of the gone viral club is none other than texas native candace payne a wife of nearly 15 years and mom to two youngsters, payne seemed to be all over your facebook newsfeed and everywhere else on the internet over the last few days when a facebook live video of her unboxing a chewbacca mask and laughing hysterically went mega viral we’re talking – it broke the internet literally, candace payne’s video has set new records as being the most-viewed facebook live video with over 133 million views but just hours after her video blew up the internet, payne goes on record with the real reason she put on that mask, and we – for the first time – have begun to understand why candace’s little stunt is about more than just a funny moment dressed as chewbacca in the front seat of a car she walked into kohl’s to buy yoga pants, but little did candace know that god had other plans for her i honestly wasn’t there for the mask, payne told i honestly wasn’t there for the mask, payne told good morning america  i was there for myself for some yoga pants because i’m trying to work out more and it’s not really going that well, but i ended up going to the toy section because i got discouraged about the yoga pants and i thought, ‘maybe not today but i can get a toy for my kids’ and i walk through the toy section and i accidentally bumped my shoulder into this box and i had seen this before, but i didn’t realize it made sounds until that moment it accidentally started making the growl, and i went, ‘i need to get that like, i don’t think my kids need that, i think i need that’ a few minutes later, candace is in her car only 30 minutes away from needing to be responsible as she puts it, and pick up her children from school but with only a few minutes to spare, she couldn’t contain herself and decided to do an ‘unboxing’ in her car and show her friends on facebook her new find so with a smile that’s worth more than its weight in gold, she introduced herself to the interwebs and began to take the chewie mask out of the box and put it on then laughter ensued candace says she tipped her head back and caught a glimpse of herself in the rearview mirror and she couldn’t contain the belly laugh that came out of her and as she saw the reactions of people responding live to her post, she got even more vivacious to the point that she couldn’t stop laughing and tears flowed out of her eyes i was struck by a very distinct feeling the first time i watched candace’s hilarious video i’ve seen plenty of viral videos before — in fact, it’s a part of my job but something is different about candace payne for the kingdom of god is not a matter of what we eat or drink, but of living a life of goodness and peace and joy in the holy spirit -romans 14:17 candace is no ordinary 15-minute-famer in fact, it wouldn’t surprise me if candace’s influence extends long past 15 minutes not only is payne adorable and obviously so much fun, it turns out that she’s someone who loves jesus too and boy does it show candace is active in her church, the oaks fellowship in red oak, texas (just outside of dallas) and she’s a dedicated wife and momma just 48 hours after her video had gone viral, candace got up on stage with a message to young creatives at an arts conference in texas, and gave nuggets of wisdom that are clearly directly from heaven when i was 16, i had a vision and a dream from the lord about my future being used for his glory i didn’t understand the interpretation of it i still to this day, at 37-years-old, try to figure that dream out but that dream has never left my heart, nor my mind, nor the way that i walk and follow jesus and i know that god has gifted me in many different areas and sometimes, i feel like i wake up and i’m a jack-of-many-trades and a master-of-none because i have that creative buzz in me, constantly going, said candace but here’s where her words get really good it doesn’t matter how talented, how anointed, how gifted, how passionate, or how willing you are if you’re not fit to do the things that god has called you to do and that is spiritually fit the thing that will take you further and farther in the kingdom of god is three things: diligence, patience, and obedience do not try to make a name for yourself his name will always outshadow yours -candace payne and that’s not all of the mic drop moments candace spoke take a look at her whole encouragement to the kids at the regional fine arts event: i pray that god, the source of hope, will fill you completely with joy and peace because you trust in him then you will overflow with confident hope through the power of the holy spirit -romans 15:13 one of the markers of jesus’ work in your life is that you have joy it doesn’t mean that you never feel sad or have a bad day, but it does mean that an unspeakable exuberance and delight fills you that sometimes there aren’t words to explain often, a hallmark of the holy spirit’s work in your life is joy and many times that comes in the form of laughter — deep, beautiful laughter — that not only releases joy in you, but in the lives of others candace payne’s video went viral not just because she’s delightful and hilarious and so much fun to watch (although all of those things are true) her video caught the attention of millions of people because she is filled with the love and joy of jesus and god used a beautiful daughter from texas, in a chewbacca mask; deciding to look past her discouragement about not finding yoga pants that fit, and find happiness in something as simple as a plastic star wars toy to bring joy to people’s lives your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the lord’s people -philemon 1:7 don’t believe me? as if the record-breaking 133 million views isn’t enough (that’s more views than mark zuckerberg has friends, by the way), then listen to the response of people who watched her video: candace shared on candace shared on good morning america that the best note she received as a result of her video is from a mom who has a daughter with autism who laughed over and over for the first time in over two months as she watched candace’s hilarious stunt from one mama heart to another mama, to see a child laugh that you haven’t seen laugh, those are the stories that i’m going to take with me everyday, said candace the world is hungry — no, they’re starving — for the joy of the lord the bible says that his joy is our strength if you are lacking joy in your life, start by asking god to give you his joy and then belly-laugh along with candace then go and spread your joy with others and you’ll find that your joy will be always flowing and apparently candace agrees with me as she said this morning on good morning america : i think the world as a whole, is in need of a good laugh i think we’re in need of somebody to lift our spirits, to not take ourselves too seriously and to break some cynicism — worldwide thank you so much candace payne for sharing the joy of the lord that is inside of you with the world you have no idea how inspiring you really are or maybe you do since you let the fruit of the spirit come out of you so freely either way, thank you, from the bottoms of our hearts for bringing more joy to the world through your laugh and letting your light shine those who have been ransomed by the lord will return they will enter jerusalem singing, crowned with everlasting joy sorrow and mourning will disappear, and they will be filled with joy and gladness -isaiah 35:10

Article - are you a glass half-full or a glass half-empty kind of person? as it turns out, some people can be both so-called realistic optimists combine the positive outlook of optimists with the clear-eyed perspective of pessimists, new research has found these realistic optimists may get the best of both worlds, using their realism to perform better at work and elsewhere, but arent getting bogged down by unhappiness, said sophia chou, an organizational psychology researcher at national taiwan university, who presented her findings at a meeting of the american psychological association in honolulu, hawaii earlier this month [7 things that will make you happy] optimists and pessimists past research has shown that optimists value thoughts that make them feel good about themselves, whereas pessimists prize a more truthful vision of themselves but a clear-eyed view can be bad for pessimists well-being, as they tend to be more prone to depression, chou said optimists tend to live longer and be healthier overall after several years working in business, chou noticed there were some people who were both optimistic and realistic, and that they tended to be very successful she wondered whether realism and optimism were really diametrically opposed so chou administered a battery of personality surveys to about 200 college and graduate students in taiwan the surveys tested how many positive illusions the students held, as well as whether they were more motivated by self-enhancement or reality realistic views the optimists sorted into two camps: the realists and the idealists realistic optimists tend to choose accuracy over self-enhancement; the unrealistic optimists tend to choose self-enhancement, chou said interestingly, the realistic optimists also got better grades, on average, than their less grounded peers -- probably because they didnt delude themselves into thinking they would do well without studying or working hard, chou said traditionally, a more realistic outlook is paired with poorer well-being and greater depression, yet the realistic optimists managed to be happy to understand why, she dug deeper into the personality assessments self-control key she found that realistic optimists believed they had more self-control and control over their interpersonal relationships every time they face an issue or a challenge or a problem, they wont say i have no choice and this is the only thing i can do they will be creative, they will have a plan a, plan b and plan c, chou said that allows them to stay cheery and upbeat about the future, even if they recognize the challenges of the present being a realistic optimist does have one downside, however: they are more prone to anxiety than their completely unrealistic peers thats likely because they recognize the possibility of failure, whereas their counterparts use positive illusions to ease their anxiety, chou said the findings suggest that realistic and unrealistic optimists may actually be very different personality types, chou said in order to cultivate a rosy-but-realistic outlook, people should maintain a clear-eyed view of reality, but emphasize what they can control in most situations, she said

Article - if youre addicted to checking your email and regularly work through evenings, weekends and vacations, you might be a workaholic -- and your health may be suffering because of it recent research has found a link between workaholism and reduced physical and mental well-being the kansas state university study, which will be published in the journal financial planning review, found that well-being is generally not a priority for workaholics we found workaholics -- defined by those working more than 50 hours per week -- were more likely to have reduced physical well-being, measured by skipped meals, doctoral researcher, sarah asebedo, said in a statement also, we found that workaholism was associated with reduced mental well-being as measured by a self-reported depression score to figure out why some choose to work overtime even when they know its not good for health, the researchers turned to a mathematical analysis called beckers theory of the allocation of time, which helps to measure the cost of time the theory highlights the paradox that working overtime leads to more income, but less time to spend this income it also suggests that as income increases, workers are more likely to develop unhealthy habits around working excessively [beckers theory] looks at the cost of time as if it were a market good, asebedo said in the statement this theory suggests that the more money you make, the more likely you are to work more if you are not engaged in work-related activities, then there is a cost to the alternative way in which time is spent even if you understand the negative consequences to workaholism, you may still be likely to continue working because the cost of not doing so becomes greater the findings are based on data from the 1979 cohort of the national longitudinal survey of youth that included 12,686 young men and women all the study participants were interviewed each year until 1994, and are still interviewed biennially of course, its no secret that overworking can have a negative effect on your health and happiness a number of studies have shown the detrimental toll that work stress in particular can take on your health, including depression and an increased risk of heart attack and diabetes and workaholism in particular has been associated with poor sleep quality, weight gain, high blood pressure, depression and anxiety, not to mention unhappy marriages and higher divorce rates and with the possibility to work from anywhere, at anytime, its easier than ever to become a workaholic in the first place more than eight in 10 americans are stressed about their jobs -- citing an unreasonable workload as their number-one stressor -- and 61 percent of employed vacationers will work through their vacation this year (up from 52 percent last year) but turning on that out-of-office autoreply and taking some time to rest and recharge can actually have a positive effect on not just your well-being, but also your productivity even a short nap can boost cognitive functioning, improving creative thinking, learning and memory renewal is not for slackers, tony schwartz, ceo of the energy project, told the huffington post renewal is a way in which to increase your capacity to be more effective

Article - filmmaking in 2013: riddick, the third vin diesel film to feature that title anti-hero, is an indie feature that means even vin diesel -- who, thanks to the fast and furious movies, stars in one of the most popular film franchises in existence -- had to independently finance the third riddick movie how did he get here? lets start with the chronicles of riddick, the sequel to pitch black, which was released on june 11, 2004 the film, which cost around $110 million, grossed just $57 million at the north american box office, making it one of that summers costly misfires after that result it was understandable that a studio -- in this case, universal -- was leery about putting more money into the franchise, even at this new films reported bargain budgetary cost of $38 million maybe, though, that was for the best in this new installment, we find riddick (diesel) left for dead on a desolate planet after a lengthy recuperation segment, the focus of the film shifts to a group of bounty hunters who are on the planet searching for riddick so, riddick, the character, shifts from our hero to, as riddick director david twohy calls him, the bogey man its something twohy, who also directed the previous two installments, says would never have happened had this been a straightforward studio movie did you ever think this third movie would ever happen after the chronicles of riddick underperformed? yeah, i had my doubts after the second one and we suffered some slings and arrows according to the studio, we spent way too much money and didnt make enough back so, thats never a good formula so, i had my doubts if you speak with vin, im thinking he would say, never a doubt that we were going to do a third movie -- because thats just the kind of guy he is he is a big dreamer im more the pragmatist of the duo vin diesel has had quite the resurgence over the last couple of years look, ive learned never to count vin diesel out just dont do that and i guess its because he is a very smart guy smarter than people give him credit for i enjoyed that in riddick the stakes are big to the characters, but not compared to all of the big summer movies we just saw these people basically just need to leave a planet and thats it and look, ive been in those meetings, too where its, we have to up the stakes we have to give it a ticking clock  so, i hope that riddick, if nothing else, feels a little more handmade than factory-made thats what i set out to do and vin was certainly along for that ride, too the first half hour, were pretty much alone with riddick then the film focuses on the bounty hunters and riddick becomes almost the bad guy, even though we spent the first part of the movie with him thats right now, thats something the studio would have fret out about wait a second you are totally sympathetic with riddick while hes trying to survive, but then youre using him as the bogey man why did you want to do that? because he is both those things he is a man he is a survivor -- a survivor with skills and enough personal code that he can be sympathetic to us, but, at the same time, never let the audience forget that hes a stone cold killer but, you know i think it works because i have to introduce those new characters  i have like 10 new characters to establish and i can bolster riddicks roar -- his legend -- by having them talk about him as they glimpse him do you think the success of the fast and furious movies helped to get riddick made? yes but, heres the cyclical nature of the business because pitch black did well, that allowed him to be part of the fast and furious franchise and guess what? what goes around, comes around so, on the basis of that, he was dropped into a major part in the fast and the furious and based on the success of that, yes, that does impact on our ability to launch this third one even though universal didnt want to make it at a certain point in fact, they didnt make it do you know that story? i do not it goes like this after chronicles, they said, we are out of the riddick business its just a straight business calculation of us you spent too much money and you didnt make enough back so, no, were not going to do anymore vin, being the savvy guy he is, said, well, give me the rights back and they didnt want to do that  i think this was about the time that fast 3 had already shot and they were testing it maybe it wasnt testing as well as it should have and they decide, maybe we need a cameo from vin -- because he wasnt in that movie so, i do believe that in his savviness, vin said, dont pay me for that cameo just give me the rights back so, his company basically controls the rights and because i control all of the sequels and remakes so, we cant make a movie without each other, nor would we want to so, thats how he got the rights back and i think that was a great business move so, ultimately, we did it as an independent movie i wrote a spec script we sold it in berlin for international we came back into town looking for a domestic partner i thought it was going to be sony or film district -- they were both eager to have the movie and then, guess what? universal raises their hand, well, what about us? and i said, this doesnt feel right to me but vin, he was saying, that was then, this is now  so with the fast and furious franchise and his relationship with universal over that and the strength of those, we placed it again at universal so, the company that kicked us to the curb [laughs] picked up the movie and will be distributing it in the us and canada so universal didnt put any money into the film? they put money into it for their domestic distribution rights so riddick is an indie film? heres an example of how its an indie film i wrote a spec script, we sold that we went up to montreal and i think i did one polish on my original script -- and then we shot that then, when it comes to editing, i got to the point when i wanted to show it to 50 people in a room, just to see what they understood: what was clear to them and what was not clear to them because of things arent clear to them, the audience cant enjoy it and i still have time to go to the editing room and clean it up i didnt have it scored and didnt fill out forms, i just stood in front of them and asked them questions  i had the studio heads in once, but we were basically locked at that point so, very pure filmmaking very pure mike ryan is senior writer for huffington post entertainment you can contact him directly on twitter

Article - the hole in the space station is superficial but a little unsettling for earthbound folk (esa/nasa) when you sit around imagining life aboard the international space station (we all do that, right?) one thing you probably don’t want to think about is space junk slamming into your vessel and you almost certainly don’t want to imagine a piece of that junk taking a chunk of your spacecraft’s window with it especially not when the chipped window in question is the one that provides some of the best views of earth [nasa reminds us that astronaut poop burns up ‘like shooting stars’] but that’s exactly what happened last month in the space station’s cupola, a european-built 2010 addition that you’re sure to recognize — it’s where those great pictures and videos showing stunning shots of our planet are taken i am often asked if the international space station is hit by space debris, british astronaut tim peake, who took the freaky photo of the damaged window, said in a statement yes — this is the chip in one of our cupola windows, glad it is quadruple glazed! um, yeah you can say that again nasa released an animation depicting space trash in motion around earth (youtube/nasa) the astronauts, of course, are perfectly safe — they generally don’t tweet photos during life-threatening station crises and the views are safe, too — the chip is less than a centimeter across according to the european space agency, the damage was likely caused by something as unassuming as a flake of paint or a metal fragment just a few thousandths of a millimeter across a flake of paint let that sink in because of the incredibly high speeds of these orbiting pieces of debris, something 1 centimeter across could disable critical instruments on the space station, and anything larger could penetrate the sturdy shields that protect crew modules debris 10 centimeters across could shatter the spacecraft into pieces in 2013, experts estimated that there were at least 29,000 objects of this size orbiting earth the danger posed by errant space debris were dramatized in the 2013 film gravity, in which astronauts on a shuttle mission are terrorized by speeding chunks of space junk space junk is definitely a real concern mashable reports that nasa tracks more than 500,000 pieces of defunct satellites and old rocket bits orbiting earth, some no larger than marbles, so that the space station can be maneuvered away from close encounters — but many small pieces, like the one that hit the space station, are too difficult to keep track of these days space agencies try to be more mindful of the waste left behind by missions, but no one has found an ideal solution for cleaning up the junk that’s already there

Article - lincoln, neb — a 34-year-old lincoln man purchased a 2012 harley-davidson softail slim motorcycle this past tuesday in an effort to cut down on his perceived duty to wave to other motorcyclists russell rusty brandt entered frontier harley-davidson’s front door around 11 am with more than a thousand dollars in his wallet a few hours later, he had completed the transaction, having agreed to pay $11,900 for the used motorcycle i learned to ride when i lived in creighton, and there weren’t many people there sometimes i would see people i didn’t know, and they would wave to me i didn’t even put two and two together that they were waving at me just because i was on a motorcycle, brandt explained it probably happened half a dozen times in two years i moved here to lincoln and learned that other riders wave a lot they expect you to wave back it’s almost like a religion brandt said the waving was the impetus for his purchase he rode in on a 2012 honda shadow, which he traded in to frontier harley-davidson towards the purchase price of his new motorcycle when you ride a harley, you just don’t have to wave, brandt said if a guy on a suzuki doesn’t wave, you have to wonder if he didn’t see you, or if he was using the clutch maybe he was having a bad day, but you don’t want to assume that, because you really don’t even know the other rider but when you see a harley, you know why the guy on it doesn’t wave it’s because he’s on a harley in fact, guys on the harley machines don’t even wave to riders on other harleys! when asked about the inconvenience of having to trade in his motorcycle for a bike of another marque and the resulting monetary loss, brandt was able to put things into perspective in terms of a simple cost-benefit analysis the shadow was a really good bike really good i mean, i didn’t even want to get rid of it, but let’s get right down to the nitty-gritty you don’t have to wave if you’re on a harley i just want to take some of the pressure off when i want to go out for a ride, and if i have to cough up some money to do that, so be it it will be worth it brandt mentioned some safety aspects that he says other riders don’t consider safety was a big consideration in his decision to purchase the big harley machine last week, i didn’t wave to a guy i passed on the left i was in the middle of shifting gears, and didn’t think about it about a mile later, i’m stopped at a red light, and the guy comes up to me and starts interrogating me about why i didn’t return his wave he was really losing it i went right home and told my wife i told her i was trading the bike i have a family i can’t have people i don’t know coming up to me and yelling at me unannounced still, brandt remained positive about his future in motorcycling it’s really not that big of a deal i wanted a new bike anyway source: revzilla

— alex micu (@axelk) september 27, 2016 snapchat spectacles are gonna be great for filming realistic porn because a) the camera is at your eye level b) it lasts ten seconds pictwittercom/qosgvh3j9e — gary he (@garyhe) september 24, 2016 but you know what they say—theres truth in every joke and this ones time is coming given the limited availability of snapchat spectacles, the sexual accessorizing of them has yet to begin in earnest mashable reached out to more than two dozen spectacles owners and found that the majority hadnt engaged in any sexual act with their new toy yet—most of them have at least had the idea i hadnt thought about that as a personal use, but one of my first thoughts was when wed see this pop up in porn, one early spectacles owner explained my friends have talked about all the possibilities that can be made with these, including sex, another said the specs will definitely be 1000% less creepier than google glass of course, theres the idea, and then the execution and people have definitely been executing on the potential for spectacles as a sex toy so far, reviews are mixed of the 26 spectacles owners we spoke with, mashable did hear from several people who wore the glasses during masturbation, foreplay and sex ive used it by myself just to dance around and be sexual, and also, used it in the beginning stages [of sex] when i was still getting intimate with a partner, rachel, the media entrepreneur, said with the glasses on, it definitely takes you out of the moment a little bit the experience wasnt seamless rachel and her partner chose to wear one pair of glasses and pass them back and forth during foreplay spectacles also only records up to 30 seconds, with the press of the button three times it definitely takes you out of the moment a little bit, she said it wasnt rachels first time making a home sex video and while she appreciated the new visceral perspective spectacles had to offer, wearing the glasses were a bit distracting, and made her feel more than a little self-conscious there was a barrier, in terms of personal space i didn’t feel as close to the person, because one of us had the sunglasses on, she said jennifer, a publicist, said she and her partner both wore them the first time, which felt fun, but two pairs of spectacles make for strange bedfellows—literally to say nothing of the viewing, itself we thought we would try it, but the first five minutes we were laughing i think teal—the color of her spectacles—was a bad choice, she said i deleted the videos right after, and we tried again a series of 10-, 20- and 30-second clips are now saved on her personal iphone, which jennifer said shes privately masturbated to, and also, sent to her boyfriend while rachel had the idea to use them for sex early on in her spectacles ownership, she was initially concerned about whether or not her videos would post instantly to her story they dont the app saves all spectacles videos in a dedicated tab within your snapchat memories still, due to privacy concerns, she downloads the stories off of the app, deletes them from snapchat, and then stores them in a personal, private folder im a little skeptical about how much snapchat can see, she said richard and jennifer saved their videos in my eyes only, a section of the app protected by a pin code, which snapchat released back in july as for professional, non-amateur use in sex, we couldnt track down any examples using spectacles, but one could still—and isnt unlikely to—show up in the near future jesse adams, co-founder and ceo of adult content app platform mikandi, says his company is already looking at the potential of spectacles we havent gotten our hands on one yet, but with the adult industry, any time there’s a new gadget, we’re very excited in terms of how to explore it, he said his company embraced the first wearable camera, google glass, and used it to create an app called tits and glass as well as film a parody porn video back in 2013 the question is what appeal will these spectacles have, if any, to this industry will they see these as a different kind of pov niche that it might be able to financially profit from or build a more general porn viewership, said lynn comella, associate professor of gender and sexuality studies at university of nevada, las vegas will it be different from google glass? snap declined to comment for this story, but a spokesperson pointed to the snapchat support and safety pages for reference spectacles support page has no direct mention of using spectacles during sex the gadgets warnings page addresses flying and driving, however all sex-related context is, for now, designated to the community guidelines for snap and snapchat thats not too surprising given that spectacles only upload videos directly to snapchat a pornography section of its community guidelines states, snapchat prohibits accounts that use public stories to distribute sexually explicit content theres no control or limitation to what users do with snapchat privately, of course cindy gallop, an advertising industry veteran and consultant who is now focused on a social sex site called makelovenotporn, said she wished snapchat would be more explicit and embrace the use case she credited snapchats explosive growth—which now boasts 150 million daily active users—to sexting, and though mashable cant prove that, its clearly a part of the app spectacles can be and will be used in sexual context, gallop said i would love to see snap be open and active about it in fact, spectacles owners have some recommendations the glasses kept slipping off i remember thinking at the time: i wish there was a strap, richard said just as snapchat inspired a third-party market for app solutions, theres bound to be  accessories for spectacles

Article_Title - yes, donald trump won latinos over marco rubio and ted cruz here’s why
Article - strange but true why the republican frontrunner just might be able to build on his success with latino voters in nevada—and win the white house as a result we know about the reagan democrats in the 1980s, union members in blue states defied their leaders in organized labor to vote for the 40th president well, in nevada, the first of the early primary or caucus states with a significant number of latino voters, we’ve caught a glimpse of a similar phenomenon—one that few could have imagined when donald trump entered the race for the republican presidential nomination you may recall that the billionaire businessman launched his foray into politics eight months ago with a speech that declared that mexican immigrants were bringing drugs and bringing crime, and that they were rapists, criminals and murderers even though, he assumed, some are good people now, it seems, some of those good people are enamored of their tormentor behold, the trump latinos according to cnn entrance polls, among latino republican voters in the silver state, john kasich got 4 percent, ted cruz 18 percent, and marco rubio 29 percent trump got an astounding 44 percent i can only think of two people who don’t seem surprised by trump’s strong showing with latinos the first is trump himself, who has been saying for months that he would do well with hispanics in fact, trump would often point to early polling from nevada that showed him beating his rivals decisively with hispanics, which is what happened trump has a theory he thinks that hispanics know that he will create jobs and that many of these jobs will go to hispanics because his years in business have taught him that hispanics are especially hard workers the other person who saw this coming was me two weeks ago, i wrote a piece for this site that looked at the phenomenon of latinos for trump that piece was criticized by everyone from white democrats to latino activists to republicans supported other candidates now, if you look at the entrance polls out of nevada, it seems clear that these critics don’t know much about latinos granted, these surveys are not the definitive final word this was a small sample of voters, and many polling experts doubt the accuracy of entrance polls besides, we are talking about just latino republicans who went to vote on a given day in the state of nevada that’s hardly a representative sample of latinos across the country and, finally, it is worth noting, most latinos weren’t even on the table for republicans in nevada because more than two-thirds of the community are registered democrats in fact, if trump is ultimately the republican nominee, it will almost assure a latino landslide for hillary clinton, who could walk away with as much as 80 percent of the latino vote still, all those caveats and conditions don’t change what happened in nevada, or its significance we need to unpack that but first, let me explain a few things about my tribe the 54 million latinos in the united states—whose ancestors can be traced to more than a dozen countries—could yield an estimated 13 million voters in november and many of those voters will be in three battleground states—nevada, colorado, and florida next, there is no suspense as to which party will scoop up the lion’s share of those votes it’s the same party that has won the majority of latino votes in every presidential election since 1960: the democratic party no republican presidential candidate has ever won the majority of latino votes finally, while many in washington will often try to compare latinos with african-americans as another aggrieved minority that has endured everything from inferior schools to overt discrimination to economic inequality, there is a competing line of thought that suggests latinos are more comparable to other catholic immigrant groups, like the irish and italians like their european immigrant brethren, latinos want to come to their ethnicity on their own terms they are fiercely patriotic americans who nonetheless identify as latino and they don’t feel as if they must choose one over the other that is relevant to this discussion because, as one reader put it to me recently: if these voters think like americans, they’ll vote for trump if they think like latinos, they won’t now, here’s what happened in nevada the latino community in the united states—and especially the nearly 70 percent of that population that is mexican or mexican-american—is highly aspirational they don’t settle they want better lives for themselves and their children they want success they don’t hate trump they want to be trump in states like nevada, colorado, texas, utah, and others, far away from the nation’s power triangle (new york-boston-washington), there were many average latinos living ordinary lives who are being drawn to trump and his promise to make america great again like many other americans who are flocking to the real estate mogul, these latinos want to know what it’s like to live in a country that is always winning and winning and what about trump’s inflammatory comments about mexico and immigration along our southern border? it’s complicated while generally more appreciative than other americans of immigration, respectful of the contributions of legal and illegal immigrants, and supportive of a comprehensive reform plan that provides the undocumented with a path to earned legal status, many latinos are also ambivalent about illegal immigration—especially if they, or their ancestors, came legally they’re leery of immigrants who abuse the system and feel entitled to make demands of the country that took them in, while waving the flag of the country that cast them adrift they’re also fed up with what they see as a new militancy among the undocumented immigrants of today—particularly young dream’ers who were brought here as children and seem to understand everything about this country except what it demands of its citizens and those who aspire to be citizens like trump, these latino voters know something is wrong with the nation’s immigration system they might not agree with his proposed solutions, but they’re not going to hold against him the fact that he’s brave enough to start the discussion besides, when trump blasts mexican immigrants as criminals, many latinos just assume he’s talking about someone else meanwhile, we shouldn’t be terribly surprised that the chattering class completely missed the latinos for trump story much of it fell into their blind spot the east coast media don’t get latinos neither do the political parties ditto for most commentators, pundits, and political strategists in fact, just about everyone with an opinion has the wrong opinion about latinos for instance, they all seem to think that latinos are demanding from government and other institutions that they be siphoned off into their own separate group and showered with preferential treatment and special accommodations not true latinos don’t want to apart from america, and they aren’t in conflict with america they are the essence of america

Article_Title - is kanye west more popular than jesus christ?
Article - kanye west has used jesus christ in his art since jesus walks never, though, has wests embrace of the son of god been as fervent as his last album, yeezus, which title is a portmanteau of wests nickname (yeezy) and jesus the album also features a direct kanye-jesus comparison in the song i am a god: i know he the most high / but i am a close high with kanye bringing a jesus lookalike on stage during his current tour, the huffington post decided now is a good time to compare the relative places of kanye and jesus in the popular zeitgeist to do this, we analyzed a years worth of twitter data (from oct 21, 2012 to oct 20, 2013) via the third-party service topsy when comparing jesus and kanye on twitter, the first question is what terms should we use for the comparison? there are a lot terms twitter users use to reference jesus: theres the broad jesus, which includes other people named jesus, the more specific jesus christ and foreign language versions -- jesucristo in spanish, gesù cristo in italian some users also tag the name, resulting in mentions for @jesus there are a lot fewer version of kanye kanye, which includes other people named kanye (though there are far less people named kanye than jesus), kanye west and @kanyewest (there are also nominal instances of people tweeting his nicknames, like yeezy and ye) since jesus doesnt have a genuine twitter account, and kanye has a habit of deleting all of his tweets, using @ mentions didnt seem that promising or fair looking to minimize instances of other people named jesus and kanye, we decided to start our search comparing kanye west with jesus christ: according to the data, in the last year worldwide, looking at only original tweets (no retweets, no replies), jesus christ had 3,936,585 mentions, while kanye west had 4,541,349 mentions pretty impressive for the 36-year-old rapper while wests total was greater overall, on a typical day, kanye didnt have more tweets than jesus kanyes numbers were skewed by a few high mention days and his median tweets/day (9,981) were, in fact, lower than jesuss median tweets/day (10,458) in fact, jesus had more tweets on the majority of days (187 out of the 365 days in the year) so, using kanye west vs jesus christ, their twitter mentions are pretty close but what about the foreign language tweets? kanye has an advantage with foreign language tweets, because countries with the latin derived alphabets, as far as we know, refer to kanye west as kanye west while, as mentioned above, there are many different ways to reference jesus only looking at the united states offers a clearer picture although there are some residents in the us who speak foreign languages, jesus christ is generally used as the identifier here, again using kanye west vs jesus christ, kanye had slightly more mentions overall, 2,429,931 to 2,224,895, but they were about equal when the day-to-day totals received consideration breaking it down state-by-state, some states tweeted more about jesus (orange states) while other states tweeted more about kanye (green states) when did users tweet the most about jesus and kanye? kanye wests top five days: 1) 8/26/2013, 90,993 tweets the day after his blood on the leaves performance at the vmas 2) 12/31/2012, 70,701 tweets new years eve kim kardashian announces shes pregnant with wests baby 3) 9/27/2013, 58,608 tweets west feuds with kimmel on twitter and gets in a confrontation with paparazzi 4) 6/18/2013, 51,012 tweets the official release of his album yeezus 5) 6/21/2013, 48192 the announcement of his babys name: north west jesus christs top five days: 1) 12/25/2012, 37,459 tweets: christmas 2) 5/9/2013, 36,393 tweets: ascension thursday 3) 3/31/2013, 35,955 tweets: easter sunday 4) 3/29/2013, 29,576 tweets: good friday 5) 4/23/2013, 26,921 tweets: st georges day jesus christs biggest day-of-the-week was sunday, while kanyes biggest day-of-the-week was monday when you look at the stream of jesus christ tweets, you will quickly notice a complication: a large amount of the jesus christ tweets are idiomatic (i just stubbed my toe jesus christ! #notblessed) and dont actually refer to the literal jesus christ usage of the exclamatory jesus christ is probably more popular among those who are at least exposed to christianity, so it may still be a good signal for jesuss popularity among the twitterati that being said, the idiomatic jesus christ doesnt directly refer to the person jesus christ, while kanye west refers to the person kanye in almost all cases, so if were looking for an apples-to-apples comparison, then jesus christs numbers are significantly smaller how much smaller? we looked at a sample of the hundred most recent tweets for jesus christ on twitter using the twitter search and found that 73 percent of uses of jesus christ were idiomatic, leaving 27 percent literal this search occurred during a tense soccer match (lots of jesus christ exclamations) and is too small of a sample to offer definitive conclusions, but it signals that the idiomatic jesus christ is accounting for a significant portion of the examined mentions so what happens if you compare jesus vs kanye? jesus had significantly more tweets: kanye had 10,412,097 tweets compared to jesuss 51,724,902 tweets looking again at a sample of the hundred latest tweets to gauge whats going on, we see the following breakdown: idiomatic: 22% literal: 70% other persons name: 8% this sample is again too small to prove definitive, but even if only 25 percent of those tweets that contain the word jesus refer to the religious figure, jesus would still have more literal tweets than kanye, and the proportion of tweets referring to jesus appears to be much higher than that we also havent accounted for different names for jesus in languages other than english when you break it down by region, mentions of jesus are more popular than kanye pretty much everywhere so, it looks like jesus is the most high on twitter -- except for justin bieber, who trumps jesus in popularity with 68,257,710 tweets for the search term bieber during the same period

Article - cheating sucks! this absolute favourite thing in the world apart from murders or robbery is as evil as any other violation we all remember happy faces, exhilaration, and sheer elation when two folks mutually get into a relationship, but half of them get thrown in predicament, simply because of infinitely  why do you ask? because some people just love to cheat and it can happen for multiple reasons - they found a better match, they just werent loyal, the opportunity of something different, emotional incompatibility, intimacy, etc  but sadly, despite cheating, most cheaters feel belaboured when caught  but lets keep the mental rationale aside and see what science has to say about it we’ve all heard the same, tired cliche about infidelity: once a cheater, always a cheater and now science is backing it a recent study proves that cheating is not a one-time thing, and that person will probably cheat on you again the venerable saying is backed in this journal titled the brain adapts to dishonesty  the study focused on the part of the brain called amygdala, which is the supplier of negative responses its a region thats associated with emotions and plays a key role in signalling, processing and assessing arousal it further responds to an individual when they lie  each time a person is caught cheating, the response to their wrongdoing is reduced we speculate that the blunted response to repeated acts of dishonesty may reflect a reduction in the emotional response to these decisions or to their affective assessment and saliency, the paper reads it further stated that the brain rationalises with the cheating ways, and feels less guilty, responsible when caught how convenient, right? when participants were dishonest for the benefit of someone else, dishonesty at a constant rate was observed, the study says when a person engages in dishonesty purely for the benefit of another it may be perceived as morally acceptable in all this, the person on the receiving end should always be open-minded -- open to options, positivity, optimism gliding in a pool of despair will drag them further into it, making it harder to cope

Article - arsène wenger was delighted with granit xhaka’s performance in arsenal’s victory at watford on saturday - and says his display brought back memories of a former midfielder the swiss midfielder attempted more passes, made more tackles and had more touches of the ball than any other player in the win, and also covered the most ground (1165km) i believe he has a good mixture of short and long balls, in midfield it is important for us to sometimes stretch the defenders, wenger said after the match we have a game that is based on shorter passes than other teams so sometimes when you have a player who can kick the longer ball, it gives us a chance to get some oxygen and some space he is a guy who plays naturally behind the ball he is a bit similar to petit in the way he plays football he likes to sit, give good long balls and be available with the centre-backs he has a good engine, good stature, he is good in the air and has a good balance in his game, he has a good short ball and a good long ball he is 24 years old, he has already experience abroad and that is always a problem and is more reassuring when a player has already played abroad somewhere he was captain at his age at monchengladbach, that is not a small club so he has leadership qualities look out for more playbuzz polls soon! copyright 2017 the arsenal football club plc permission to use quotations from this article is granted subject to appropriate credit being given to wwwarsenalcom as the source

statham ripped as fuck in death race credit: universal pictures well, the 49-year-old, who has studied wing chun, kung fu, karate, and kickboxing, applies himself to a strict diet, as well as a strict workout regime and by strict, i mean fucking strict; this is jason statham were talking about, hes a no nonsense kind of bloke statham only eats good food, saying 95% of what he eats is clean - the other 5% being small treats every now and again he also swears by cutting out all the sugars and heavy starch in the afternoon if you eat carbs later in the day, its harder to work off - if needs be, have them in the morning and your daily activities should work off the calories in an interview with mens health, the star revealed that for breakfast he goes for either granola, fresh fruits and oats, porridge, or poached eggs for lunch, he says in the interview to broaden your horizons, but fair warning, its not going to sound too appealing im certainly no vegan, but theres this little place down on sunset that ill go to, the california vegan, and they do a really good steamed vegetable and brown rice, he said you put that in your body and you feel good or try a nice miso soup theres nothing better than that stuff he goes on to say that the latest you should ever have your evening meal is 7pm, and it should be high in protein he specifies chicken, fish and lean beef, accompanied by vegetables or salad the icing on the cake, as well, is to drink a minimum of three litres of water a day; he has knocked fruit juices, full of added sugar and fructose on the head, as well as alcohol so, unfortunately, youre not going to get as stacked as the transporter star while chugging lagers every other day of the week, and then ending the night with a sweaty kebab jasons workout plan is a different kettle of fish the martial arts expert believes in never repeating the same workout as he feels you see more results from varying your exercises therefore its hard to pinpoint a solid plan http://lionsgt/mechanictrailer a photo posted by jason statham (@jasonstatham) on jul 3, 2016 at 5:10am pdt a photo posted by jason statham (@jasonstatham) on according to bodybuildingcom, the 49-year-old has two rules when it comes to hitting the gym: 1) never repeat a workout - it is virtually impossible to go through a training plan without repeating the exercises but each and every workout would be varied 2) take notes of everything - as you progress through the workouts, it is inevitable that you will get fitter, faster and stronger therefore, it is vital to a successful plan to record all lifts and times so that intensities can be calculated whatever workout he chooses to do, he will do a five to 10 minute general warm-up, which will be him using an elliptical machine (cross fit trainer), or something else that works the whole body he told bodybuildingcom that following this warm-up, he does another 10 minutes of medium intensity exercises this will include the likes of front squats, dead-lifts, exercises carrying kettle bells, sandbags or dumbbells, a variety of explosive medicine ball exercises, and circuit training the snatch star has a specific non-iron circuit training regime, too, which requires no equipment he told mens health that he picks five exercises from exploding push-ups, squat thrust, burpees, sit-ups or crunches, step-ups, tuck jumps, squat jumps, star jumps or pull-ups, and does 10 reps of each anyone else out of breath just thinking about this? stathams high intensity boxing workout begins with shadow boxing, working the back and shoulder, with lunges and some quad, groin, and hamstring stretching in between to work the legs he then moves onto five three minute rounds on the pads, and once that is completed, steps it up to three, three minute rounds on a heavy bag the workout is then finished off with three rounds on the speed bag and a warm down for a weight based high intensity workout, stathams trainer will choose a combination of six exercises, set a required rep range for each individual exercise, and then repeat five times the time taken to complete the five circuits is recorded, and is how the level of intensity is measured the times are then turned into targets so they can be used to increase the intensity of the workout as fitness levels increase of the exercises, bodybuildingcom says they include barbell front raises, dumbbell burpees, farmers walk, pull-ups, bear crawl sled drag, close-grip pull downs, front squats, hanging knee raises, weighted step ups, and one-arm cable rows no wonder hes fucking jacked words by mark mcgowan

Article - its not often that you find a completed diy project that leaves you drooling, but this might be the exception one man had some empty space in his attic, so he decided to fix it up into the man cave of his dreams instead of just making it into private space, he decided to put a twist on the room revamp he converted it into a boats cabin as crazy as that sounds, it actually turned out awesome! this is the attics original entrance and this is what it used to look like he modified the angle of the roof with some beams dont try this at home yourself manipulating pre-engineered structural beams like this could be very dangerous this was a touchy process, as he was changing the angle of the inside of the attic without compromising the structural integrity of the beams then, he needed to find a way to create a new entrance into the attic the existing opening is in the middle of the hall, which wouldnt work out so he chipped away at a wall that was adjacent to stairs that led down into the garage he used this opening as the new entrance up into the attic olivier-fr even added a very fitting door with a nautical window this is the door, which didnt lead to anything, at first he planned on adding a roof window that would hopefully result in some extra light more importantly, there would need to be stairs into the cool new attic heres the stair frame, soldered and painted black installed and ready to go! he enclosed the stairs in a small capsule what it looked like from the outside the new attic was covered with wood paneling and painted heres the skylight looking good, even without the full coat of paint here are the stairs from above the view from the attic window olivier-fr got the whole family involved when it came time to build some furniture after the whole place was painted, carpeting went down the wood of the stairs was a dark exotic grain he switched out the door for a sliding one to save space then, he added a railing as a safety precaution time to decorate! a television, sound system, and some cool wall hangings were all necessary plus, a fouton, weight bench, and some lounge space to stabilize the temperature, lots of insulation was added plus, a heating/cooling unit most other attic rooms just pale in comparison to this awesomeness this is basically a treehouse for adultswhich is why its so great! its hard not to feel at least a little jealous

Article - late last year, just in time for christmas shopping, rachel rhoads got a nice surprise one of her secret savings accounts had grown to $900 behind her back rhoads, a 37-year-old los angeles-based sales director for a jewelry line, has an account with digit, a financial technology company with an algorithm that tracks users’ income and spending patterns it painlessly spirits small amounts of money out of checking and into a savings account every two or three days  i just thought it was such a good idea, to set it and forget it, said rhoads, who says she is like a squirrel in her approach to saving digit sends texts with balance updates, which she largely ignores because i like to pretend the saving is not happening  getting consumers comfortable with putting their finances on customized autopilot, starting with a simple, no-fee—and no-interest—savings account, is the san francisco startup’s mission in two years, its users have saved more than $350 million this way, according to its 31-year-old founder and chief executive officer, ethan bloch when the product moved out of pilot mode, in february 2015, users were saving about $1 million a month; now that’s more than $35 million a month digit won’t disclose the size of its user base but says it has tripled from about a year ago digit had a savings bot before bots were cool, or at least before the hype in the financial technology world reached a fever pitch its product is simple an algorithm looks at a user’s average, high, and low checking account balance, when the user is paid, and whether the pay cycle is smooth or choppy then, after looking for bills due in the next week or two and analyzing recent spending, it moves an amount it judges the customer won’t miss to a savings account the company makes money from the interest rate it gets on account assets digit announced today that it will be the first savings bot on facebook messenger’s platform, so users can just use facebook to communicate with it when digit moved out of its pilot phase, it communicated only by text, a natural language for many users, since 17 percent of them are aged 21 to 24, and 44 percent are from 25 to 34 years old rhoads said they’re cute texts with some personality and not annoying at all after text messaging came ios and android apps for users the company is now working on what bloch called the first artificial intelligence-powered financial goal program users would set a date and amount (and pick an emoji, of course), and digit’s algorithm would make a series of projections based on balances to determine the optimal amount needed to start saving toward that goal—or point out that the goal is unrealistic also on the product horizon is having digit’s algorithm figure out how to move every dollar where it should go, at the right time, to minimize fees [on student loans, credit card  accounts, etc] and maximize gain, bloch said  there are hitches since digit isn’t a bank, it can’t pay interest, and it will be competing in an environment of rising rates bloch said interest rates are not a huge deal for his customers, because they regularly withdraw money and tend to save small sums another hurdle is that traditional bank technology can make it hard to connect accounts banks have not made it easy for customers to get their data, bloch said because of that, digit and products like acorns, venmo, betterment—every day we have bank difficulties that affect thousands of customers behavioral finance underlies much of digit’s design take the goal function, for example: if users get more specific about what they are saving for, research suggests, they are less likely to withdraw the money if an account is labeled charlie’s education fund, i’ll think harder about withdrawing it than if it’s just labeled savings, bloch said currently, 70 percent of digit users withdraw 80 percent of their savings every 90 days, mainly to pay bills and meet short-term needs for cash, to pay off debt, or pay for travel blochs broadest long-term goal is to make digit’s user interface far more conversational, to humanize it so users feel more in control when they communicate with it we want to make digit understand more—not as broad as alexa or siri, but widen the aperture a little more—related to finances and your money, he said one day, it would be awesome to say, ‘hey, digit, am i ok for retirement?’ and all digit does is send back a thumbs-up emoji that kind of complex analysis won’t show up anytime soon but after a series b round of fundraising led by venture capital firm ribbit capital, digit’s 22-person team is sitting on $25 million in cash that, bloch said, will let the company be somewhat protected for the next few years in pushing the envelope, largely to invest in product development the big question for us now is, what more will our customers trust digit to do?

Article - photo credit: engadgetcom all roads lead to skynyrd no matter where you go in the rock and roll spectrum, all roads inevitably lead to lynyrd skynyrd – a band as fiercely respected for their ability to get to the heart of the human condition in the form of honest lyrics wrapped around soaring melodies as they are for their innovative approach to everything from guitar playing to crafting the perfect rhythm section, their influence is felt in every facet of modern rock music in fact, lynyrd skynyrd played a huge role in the success of another iconic band as they made their rise to fame; los angeles rockers guns n’roses, who thanks to these jacksonville natives, achieved critical acclaim with their smash hit sweet child o’ mine from 1987’s appetite for destruction – but how? according to guns n’ roses frontman axl rose, sweet child o’ mine was directly inspired by lynyrd skynyrd; when crafting the song’s nostalgic, strangely romantic feel, axl turned to jacksonville’s finest for a lesson in how to write straight from the heart and make it mean not just something, but everything: for ‘sweet child’ i went out and got some old skynyrd tapes to make sure that we’d got that heartfelt feeling, reveals rose we’ve been fans of lynyrd skynyrd for decades, and we’re always amazed at how far their influence stretches! always setting the bar high for themselves and for future generations of bands with each album and each performance, the way that skynyrd has shaped the way rock music is made is possibly one of the greatest parts of the legacy they forged on that baseball diamond a lifetime ago whether ronnie van zant would have liked guns n’roses, we’ll never know – but somehow, we think he’d be mighty pleased to know that the legacy he helped build is positively impacting the music world and inspiring artists to stretch themselves to achieve something great!

Article - assange appeared via video link from the ecuadorian embassy in london as part of the ‘new era of journalism: farewell to mainstream international media’ forum in moscowhe said: google is directly engaged with hillary clinton’s campaign and claimed the technology giant used the us state department on a quid pro quo basis of course when she is in power she is a problem for freedom of speech we know what she is going to do and she made the chart for the destruction of libya, she was involved in the process of taking the libyan armoury and sending it to syria assange reiterated his claims that clinton is a war hawk that seemingly wants to start wars what we have with clinton is someone who is a hawk but who has the tools of legal interventionism, a rhetorical cover to start wars, and someone who seemingly wants to start them from wikileaks’ perspective hillary clinton is a problem in terms of war and peace he also pointed out that former google ceo eric schmidt is now heading the pentagon innovation board google is heavily integrated with washington power, at personal level and at business level google, which has increasing control over the distribution channels, is intensely allying itself with the us exceptionalism it [google] shows the will to use that at different levels it will inevitably influence its audience the founder and editor-in-chief of wikileaks added: google is an intensely washington, dc-aligned company i see a google exit from china it seems much more to do with google’s feeling that it is part of ‘family america’ and that it is opposed to the chinese fortune reported last year that researchers had found that google search rankings could potentially decide the outcome of an election through five experiments in two countries biased rankings in search results can shift the opinions of undecided voters by 20% or more, sometimes even reaching as high as 80% in some demographic groups if google tweaks its algorithm to show more positive search results for a candidate, the researchers say, the searcher may form a more positive opinion of him or her

Article - online gambling might only be quasi-legal in the us, but thats not stopping offshore sites from letting people place their bets on who will be fighting for the oval office in november and oddsmakers are pretty convinced at this point that its going to come down to donald trump and hillary clinton trump is given a 71% chance of winning the republican nomination, says the election betting odds website (using data from online casino betfaircom , the site averages the current bid and ask prices to come up with the implied odds) clinton is given an 87% chance of sealing the democratic nomination by the site she also is favored to win the general election by 55% but what about the polls? thats certainly better odds than either candidate is seeing in national political polls an average of six polls from news organizations on real clear politics shows trump leading the republican field with 332% and among democrats, clinton, with 472% is just five points ahead of bernie sanders there is, of course, a difference between polls and casino odds one actively and methodically solicits the opinions of registered voters the other is determined purely by gambler gut instinct so, while you may want to take the casino odds with a grain of salt, its worth noting that betfair isnt the only online gambling site thats predicting a strong trump showing in the primary -- with clinton winning a narrow victory paddypowercom currently gives trump 5/2 odds for winning the presidency clinton is still the frontrunner, with 8/11 odds (marco rubio has 6/1 odds on that site, while sanders is far back at 12/1) put in real world dollars, that means if you were to bet $100 on clinton and she won, youd see returns of $17273 take the odds for trump and that $100 would become $350 big bets on clinton oddsshark, meanwhile, says data from bovada indicates you might be better served to just hold onto your money if youre considering getting some skin in the political game the odds for clinton winning the democratic nomination are so overwhelming that a $100 bet would just earn you an extra $10 and that same bet on trump to take the republican nomination would pocket you just $25 more should those two face off in november? a $100 bet for clinton today would be worth $17143, while a trump victory would turn $100 into $260 scientific? not even remotely close but it does show what many people perceive will be the final ballot and perception, especially in public forums, sometimes has a sneaky way of becoming reality

Article_Title - how a 28-year-old who retired with a $2 million net worth is investing in 2017
Article - in 2016, jp livingston celebrated her 28th birthday she also retired last month, i spoke with her about how she was able to retire, despite the fact that she only graduated from college about seven years ago jp (a pen name she goes by on her blog, themoneyhabitorg) was able to retire because of her high earnings, lofty savings goals and disciplined investment techniques her investment strategies are part of what allowed her to build a net worth of about $225 million  with less than a week left in the year, so many of us are setting goals for the new year, which includes figuring out an investment plan for 2017 deciding on investment strategies or goals can help us figure out what we want our long-term financial picture to look like, and shape our budget for the coming year when laying out an investing plan, who better to learn from than a woman whose investments boast high returns, and who retired before 30? in our q&a, jp discusses her personal 2017 investment plan, and provides useful insights for investors looking to build their nest egg more aggressively this interview has been edited for brevity maya kachroo-levine: youve had investments of over $1 million yield a 13% return ($130,000) in just one year can you speak to your investment strategy that year, and can you walk us through your 2016 investment strategy? jp livingston: my investment strategy for several years has been a twist on a broadly discussed strategy to go long on equities many financial experts (those who arent compensated for getting you to invest a certain way) will tell you that if you are young and in the wealth accumulation phase of your life, to consider parking your money in a low-cost index fund, for example, vanguards total stock market index fund (vtsax) there are a few key arguments for this strategy first, its a nice hedge against inflation because the companies in the index are presumably raising their prices with inflation; since companies are valued on a multiple of revenue or profit, this will be captured in the growth of the stock market secondly, and most importantly, is that its hard to argue with its results the compound annual growth rate for stocks on the s&p index for the last 30 years has been 11% there are very few if any opportunities available to us regular individual investors that can top that kind of return for the risk (note: youll get an entirely different view from hedge funds or mutual funds they believe they can beat market returns and so they charge high fees for their time and efforts a few of them are worth it most of them are not) kachroo-levine: what are you planning on changing about your strategy in 2017? livingston: as a retiree, steady cash flow is going to matter more to me than it has in the past there are only two ways to make money: appreciation and income stocks, for example, are about appreciation you make very little money on a regular basis (usually a puny 1%-2% in dividends), but a year or two or three later, you can sell it for much more than you paid and pocket the difference a heavily appreciation-based strategy, like going 100% into index funds, will no longer meet my needs income-based strategies, by contrast, put a steady paycheck in the spotlight bonds are generally purchased for the interest they provide sure they can appreciate or depreciate in value, but the bulk of your return from a bond comes from the monthly or quarterly dividend it pays i have a few years to build myself an income-based strategy, as i still have some deferred compensation coming from my old employer, but im looking to add one or two rental properties to my portfolio in 2017 interest rates are still fairly low so its not a bad time to be a borrower i would also look at adding more bonds to my portfolio (specifically leveraged municipal bond funds; the leverage juices returns and municipal bonds are tax exempt), but i do not want to buy bonds right now, as the fed has signaled a plan to increase interest rates (and even raised them just a week ago) kachroo-levine: what are your financial/investment goals for 2017? what are your priorities? livingston: as i am newly retired, my main priority is transitioning my portfolio into more income-based opportunities that can provide steady money to cover my expenses each year im on the lookout for a rental property or two to take advantage of low interest rates and which will provide some much-needed steady income in some parts of the country like san francisco, rental properties are actually negative cash flow exercises and are predicated on appreciation in some areas, it will throw off 6%-7% or more in income each year and fit my income needs real estate is hyperlocal like that kachroo-levine: what are the key philosophies that help shape your investment strategy? livingston: i feel ive gotten pretty far on just two thingsfirst, dont be afraid to say you dont know people get really weird and insecure when it comes to money were all lifelong learners i have to admit i dont know basic things all the time for example, while ive read quite a bit about real estate investment, im constantly finding myself with a giant question mark as i apply those concepts to my first live investments my priority though is to make money and learn, not to impress people second: dont give up until you really feel you understand something  finally, my other silver bullet question is to ask what are the arguments against it? or what are the three things that could break this strategy? theres no free lunch every strategy has some vulnerability kachroo-levine: what advice can you offer for novice investors in 2017? specifically, if you were speaking to people who had never invested beyond a 401(k) or ira, what would you say to them? livingston: you are in such an exciting place, because there is low-hanging fruit all around you a few things: 1 money management is an incremental game, not a winner-take-all game that means every tweak you make has a noticeable impact on your money, and it means you dont have to choose between going whole hog or absolute zero you can devote however much time and effort you have and get proportional results and new ideas to employ 2 momentum matters most start by joining a few interesting communities and blogs and read a little bit a few times a week cruise around on the reddit personal finance forum investment is only painful or boring when you try to cram too much too fast, or you go find a dry, educational source and force feed yourself the information momentum is the most important piece when you start any new project too many people think alright, its time to do this investment stuff and go and buy some highly rated book on amazon to start their education thats such a self-defeating way to start is that how you got into skiing, or guitar or interpretive celtic dance? has that kind of textbook strategy ever succeeded in firing up your passion? kachroo-levine: for those seeking early retirement, can you share why your investments are so crucial to your early retirement journey? livingston: your nest egg is like an entire extra employee doing work for you, an employee that gets better and stronger and eventually eclipses you say you make $100,000 pre-tax and save $30,000 a year once your nest egg is three times your salary, or $300,000, at a 10% return it will generate as much as you slaving a whole year to put away has accomplished at 10-times your salary and a 10% return, it is throwing off more money than you make in an entire year you could be sitting on the beach drinking mai tais and still see a years worth of salary come in just from your investments of course, you cant guarantee consistent 10% returns, but you have a long-term bet that you can achieve during your accumulation phase by investing in low-cost index funds more on forbes:

Article - you may have recently seen a viral video compilation of cats freaking out after they’ve been ambushed by a dastardly foe: the humble garden cucumber in these videos, the kitties are usually eating, and their owners surreptitiously sneak up behind them, place the vegetable down, and wait for their pet to turn around according to iflscience, the cats’ fearful reactions—which include jumping, running, or pawing at the long green vegetable—are likely due to the surprise element of having an unexpected object placed into their territory without notice in short, you could likely replicate the experiment with any other vegetable (animal behavior specialists also have other theories, including that the cats might think the cucumber is a deadly snake or other predator) however, national geographic reports that your cat’s fright is more harmful than hilarious while the cucumber isn’t stressful to you, it’s stressful to the cat and since your pet usually has positive associations with the space surrounding its food bowl, you’re startling it while it’s in its comfort zone in worst case scenarios, it can react by hurting itself, breaking a household object, or remaining anxious for days bottom line? slowly introduce new toys and objects to your cat, as they’re a source of mental stimulation just don’t unexpectedly give it a cucumber—or for that matter, any other new item that might cause distress

Article - jamie parker you have abandonment issues, obviously you both share story credit with j k rowling how did it work having three writers in the mix? john tiffany jo rowling was incredibly generous i met her first, and i already had a soft spot for her because she used to write in the cafe of the traverse theater in edinburgh when i was the director it was only after the first book came out that i realized it had been her, nursing one cappuccino for four hours when we met to talk about the play, she asked, what do you think the harry potter stories are about? i said, learning to deal with death and grief there was something in her eye — i thought, we didn’t say it’s about transformation or magic or flying on brooms, and we’re on the right track thorne we all met in edinburgh and as the day developed, we knew we would take the epilogue of harry potter and the deathly hallows as a starting point tiffany all the seeds are there; we start with that scene in the train station am i allowed to say that? anyway, it was clear that she was going to let us take those characters and have our own ideas callender of course, jack came to the table with an encyclopedic knowledge of harry, so that helped thorne all right, i’m a nerd with abandonment issues did you really sketch out the whole arc of the story in that first meeting? thorne yes, but then it took about six months to really map the whole thing out every time it was like taking a big step forward, one or two small ones back jo would say, this feels right, this doesn’t tiffany there are parts of the story, which when we first conceived them, i didn’t think she would let us do, but she never hesitated it is one thing to let us continue the story, another to let us unravel the canon friedman that’s enough! was the idea of a two-part play there from the beginning? tiffany no, not at all but we knew we had to deal with going beyond where the books left off, but also go back and look at the stories within them we wanted to develop the characters that are already known and keep that consistency, but also introduce new ones it was clearly hard to put an epic tale into two-and-a-half hours we had a meeting and said, why not two parts? and we knew right away how we wanted to end the first part it’s a cliffhanger noma dumezweni it does that wonderful thing that books do when they work; it makes you desperate for more story how is it different telling that story as a play rather than a novel? thorne we can tell the story of the younger and older generation at the same time, which the books didn’t do the exciting thing has been working out how those worlds fit together it’s a coming-of-age story as much for the adults as for the children john and i are more or less the same age as harry in the play and i just had my first child, so there has been a lot of discussion about growing up, being a parent tiffany how do you mother or father when you still need parenting yourself? dumezweni also, i think the difference with a play is that you’re not experiencing the story on your own the way you do with a book being in the theater is a communal experience, and this play, with two parts, is a commitment i’m fascinated to see what my daughter will think after a whole day in the theater as an actor, it’s something i’ve never experienced before what about dealing with the issue of magic in the theater, where you can’t create the kind of effects that happen in film? tiffany film has got green screen we’ve got the imagination of the audience how do you feel, jamie and noma, playing characters that a huge fan-base feel so possessive about? is it intimidating? dumezweni i think jamie found it very intimidating [everyone laughs] parker it’s not so different from playing any role that is within a canon you have the responsibility of being sensitive to the collective investment in the story but you just have to try to serve the play the best way you can and not worry about that dumezweni the weight of expectation is huge but for me that pressure has been outweighed by getting text messages from mums i know saying how huge it is for their mixed-race daughters that i am playing hermione ultimately it’s a theater piece, i’m a theater actor and doing a job as best i can has it been difficult to work under conditions of intense secrecy? and what about when previews start and people are talking about the play online? callender i’m hopeful after seeing how people were about star wars they mostly protected the fans tiffany it will be a relief when the text is published, when the play officially opens on july 30, so that it’s not our secret to keep but if you don’t read it, and you choose not to read reviews, we’ve made it possible to come without prior knowledge parker and you don’t get that much nowadays so often things are ruined because you know so much dumezweni i’ve quite loved the secrecy although, of course, my home life is [expletive] my daughter tries to guess what is in the play she says, just smile at me if i’m right tiffany my mum is the only problem everyone else is fine she asks really specific questions; then i discovered people are quizzing her in her local supermarket parker when people ask, i just pull out a wand, and go, i’m a wizard!

Article - how much compensation the folks at pacific investment management co, better known as pimco, haul in each year has always been a topic of fascination on wall street in 2012, news reports suggested that the firms top 30 partners pulled down an average $33 million a year in compensation in recent years a subsequent column by felix salmon guessed that the average investment professional at pimco was making roughly $7 million each annually a pimco spokesman denied salmons claim, responding that the numbers cited in your blog post today are wildly inaccurate salmons speculation was, indeed, wildly inaccurate -- to the downside actual bonuses at pimco are higher, much higher, than probably any outsiders previously believed based on news reports, public records and new data obtained by bloomberg view, it appears that pimco had a 2013 bonus pool for its 60 managing directors of almost $15 billion so how much have pimcos top executives earned? according to documents provided to bloomberg view by someone with knowledge of pimcos bonus policies, the numbers break down like this: gross earned $290 million as his year-end bonus for 2013 mohamed el-erian, pimcos former chief executive officer and one-time heir apparent to gross, received $230 million (el-erian is a fellow bloomberg view contributor) and the story doesnt end with pimcos two most visible (former) employees former deputy chief investment officer daniel ivascyn -- now serving as grosss replacement as pimcos chief investment officer -- took home a $70 million bonus wendy w cupps, the global head of product management, garnered $50 million, making her one of the highest-paid woman in finance (her rocky push into equities was the subject of well-publicized haranguing by gross) douglas hodge, now the ceo, took home $45 million of holiday cheer these giant bonuses almost make the $22 million awarded to pimco’s president, jay jacobs, seem puny the top three managers after gross and el-erian -- ivascyn, cupps and jacobs -- were rumored to have been behind the coup that sent gross packing to janus capital in september next month, free of gross and el-erian, these three will have an extra half a billion or so to keep to themselves or distribute to the other managing directors gross’s bonus -- 20 percent of the total bonus pool for 2013 -- places him in a compensation class of his very own to put that figure into context, in 2013 gross made just shy of what the next 20 publicly held finance company ceos made combined in the world of sports, you would have to take the total salaries, winnings and endorsement deals of lebron james, lionel messi, kobe bryant, tiger woods and roger federer -- together -- to be on par with gross * * * how pimco became such an earnings machine is a quirk it has been four decades since it was spun out of pacific life insurance co, a move that was made in part to allow gross a freer hand to manage the insurer’s fixed income portfolio since then, pimco has grown into a behemoth, in terms of the bottom line and as a force in the bond market much of what we know about pimco stems from allianz ses $33 billion purchase of 70 percent of the firm in 2000 a publicly traded german insurer, allianz has released some details about pimco’s operations in its quarterly earnings reports that data, along with mutual fund disclosures and filings, provide hints about the firm’s revenue we can estimate earnings by looking at the largest pimco funds the 20 biggest have an average fee of about 61 basis points let’s lower that to account for discounts given to large institutional clients, and we get a rough estimate of about 50 basis points on $182 trillion dollars, that yields $91 billion in revenue a year pimco is, by any measure, a fabulously wealthy company using my back-of-the-envelope revenue estimate, it generates far more revenue per employee than any bank or asset manager -- almost four times as much as goldman sachs when allianz bought into pimco, it picked up about $250 billion in assets under management pimco currently manages about $2 trillion the bonus structure is a quirk of that original deal: allianz’ partial purchase left pacific life owning 30 percent of pimco but pacific life wasnt interested in running the asset-management business and even after the allianz deal, everyone involved continued to defer to gross’s financial and managerial judgment thus pimco -- based in newport beach, california, and 6,000 miles removed from its majority owners -- remained fully autonomous bloomberg views fee analysis suggests allianz takes about 70 percent of the total revenue pimco generates annually (plus or minus a few percentage points) pimco keeps the rest this same deal structure continued even after allianz purchased the 30 percent of pimco that it didnt already own from pacific life in the mid-2000s a subsequent restructuring in 2011 saw gross and his team gain even greater control over the firm that gave pimco so much freedom in relation to its corporate parent that, as one analyst described it to bloomberg news, it appeared as if it was the tail wagging the dog * * * part of the reason for grosss longevity after the allianz takeover -- and another element of the firms enormous wealth -- is what we might call the pimco premium despite being in a competitive field including giant companies such as vanguard and blackrock, pimco manages to charge more than the industry standard for access to its funds and its separately managed accounts why? when competing for business, the firm has had an unbeatable combination of a long history and outstanding long-term results (at least it did, until recent bad bets on rising interest rates by gross torpedoed the 1-, 3- and 5-year record of the flagship total return fund) pimco also became the go-to company for the federal reserve and us treasury in many of the credit facilities used to combat the continuing economic fallout from the financial crisis pimcos success in the federal governments program to jumpstart consumer lending and a variety of mortgage-backed security programs added more luster to its reputation gross even managed to buy up lots of mbss before the fed officially announced the programs shareholders of the total return fund netted about $10 billion from its mortgage plays beyond the sheer size of pimcos bonuses, there are other aspects of its compensation practices that should give pause to everyone involved in institutional asset management for one, pimco has been part of a publicly traded company -- allianz -- for the past 15 years unbeknownst to allianzs shareholders, employees of one of its business units have been paying themselves these extraordinarily large sums of money in the us, it is hard to imagine $15 billion in spending on anything not being disclosed almost 16 percent of pimcos revenue is a material amount of money that would normally require disclosure in the us but allianz is a german company, subject to different regulations another item worth noticing: pimco investors represent pension funds, foundations, charitable trusts, 401ks and other retirement accounts pimcos enormous, self-paid bonuses come right off of the top of the returns those outside investors might otherwise receive in a recent allianz presentation following gross departure from pimco, the firms new chief executive, doug hodge, stated, we dont comment on matters of compensation but while gross may be gone, the high fees and compensation structure at pimco appear to remain firmly in place allianz doesnt seem inclined to change things -- it started a $279 million award program this fall to keep people from following gross out the door however, if there is going to be change, it can only come from pimcos big institutional customers why should they pay a pimco premium? pimcos profits are down by 79 percent in the third quarter of this year, and the firm saw saw almost $50 billion in outflows last month janus, grosss new home, has managed to attract only about $430 million in new money since he joined the market for fixed income asset management has never been in greater flux than it is today the realignment of power among bond managers is only just beginning if ever there was a moment when investors could demand more competitive fees from their bond managers, it is now perhaps it might also be a good time for pimco itself to consider slicing its fees anecdotally, stories abound of pimco institutional salespeople offering steep one-year fee discounts as a way to retain assets if i were managing pimco (even from 6,000 miles away), i would be looking at ways to make those fee reductions more permanent i bet i even could find close to a billion and a half dollars in savings

Article - image: getty facebook could be your next landlord in an effort to drum up support for the controversial expansion of its headquarters, the social media giant is trying to give back to the community by building at least 1,500 housing units that can be rented by the general public—not just facebook employees but there’s a catch as facebook slowly wades into the real estate development business, the company is pushing an aggressive pr agenda to convince people that facebook does not exacerbate income inequality in areas where it develops real estate facebook has pledged that 15 percent of the new units it creates will go to low- or middle-income families which is great until you realize that 85 percent of the building will probably be ridiculously expensive and probably populated by local tech bros facebook has been embroiled in a fiery debate about income inequality for years this january, the world bank published a 330-page report showing how the largest technology companies are increasing income inequality rather than helping it some of the perceived benefits of digital technologies are offset by emerging risks, the report said many advanced economies face increasingly polarized labor markets and rising inequality—in part because technology augments higher skills while replacing routine jobs, forcing many workers to compete for low-paying jobs that’s exactly what happened when facebook attracted thousands of new residents into the menlo park area, where its headquarters is located most of the new residents are well-educated, high-income earners who drove up housing pricers, forced lower income families to move, and exacerbated income inequality throughout the area obviously, that doesn’t win mark zuckerberg many new friends in the area meanwhile, facebook is trying to win support for a lucrative proposal to expand its headquarters by 11 million square feet the proposal is still missing some important details, though for starters, it’s still unclear if facebook itself will develop the buildings or hire a third party secondly, it’s also unclear what the timeline for the development is despite lacking specifics, the impact of the proposal is obvious: facebook would dramatically increase its footprint in an area where it’s already driven up real estate prices and driven out those who can’t afford the rent sponsored this isn’t the first time facebook has been involved in controversial housing development, either in 2013, the company built a 394-unit housing community within walking distance of its offices that included its own sports bar, outdoor pool, and pet daycare at the time, a wall street journal report referred to the project as being similar to a company town, the name for small communities built by robber barons of the 20th century that housed factory workers the employers provided everything including health care, law enforcement, and even churches towns like pullman, illinois were created as capitalist utopias but ultimately, the bosses failed to protect workers and residents is facebook turning menlo park into a 21st century version of pullman? it’s too soon to tell the new office expansion is slated service at least 6,500 new employees and offering housing to the general public to offset crowding concerns is certainly a gesture on facebook’s part but while some poor people will get homes in the new real estate development, it’s surely won’t be enough to fix the area’s greater socioeconomic problems [wall street journal]

Article - at decembers global diabetes summit in berlin, doctors described type 2 diabetes as scarier than hiv and malaria, causing more deaths than either but is society enabling the deadly killer? it takes a seismic event to get a transglobal family together in one place for mine, it was the death of my grandmother in kerala she had been our collective anchor my grandmother spoke five languages, so that she could communicate with all of her grandchildren, and knew exactly how everyone liked their tea and everyone liked it differently, all with slightly different amounts of sugar upon receiving the unexpected phone call, a sleepless night (pierced by even more phone calls) led to a hazy 40 hours which was broken up by a taxi, two planes, a few chocolate bars, a muted airport greeting and another car journey by the time i arrived in calicut, at the house where i had spent my childhood, there were only a few hours left until the funeral someone made me a syrupy tea, which boosted my energy, and briefly, my mood i made myself another two more following the funeral, my aunt, who had travelled from america, asked me to take a walk with her the oppression of the midday sun had subsided slightly, and if we stretched our legs, she said, we would feel better about the tea and sweets we could have when we got back home calicut, where i was born, is a city on indias south-west coast i often thought, with no authority other than nostalgic affection, that it looked like someone had cut roads into the middle of a lush forest theres significantly less traffic than in many other cities in india coconut trees line the streets, as the arabian sea sparkles to the west and the wayanad hills rise in the east during the 13th century, calicut became a major port for the indian ocean trade route merchants were said to manipulate the monsoon winds to transport spices, cotton - and sugar - from there to the west and as my aunt and i took our walk, we passed several street vendors a man was pulping sugar canes into a drink feeling slightly light-headed, i was tempted to buy one when something else caught my eye on the side of the road, under a papaya tree, a one-room shop, that i had been familiar with my whole life, was boarded up it had belonged to a tailor named padmanabhan he had, with his sole sewing machine and thick robust fingers, been the architect of many of my familys fashion choices over the years hed cut and shaped my aunts wedding sari and my cousins hed made my school uniform and my nieces and nephews hed disapprovingly made me my first pair of skinny jeans, and pretended not to smile when i told him that people had asked if they were from paris he died, my aunt said, following my gaze of what, he was only in his 50s, wasnt he? i asked, not particularly surprised that the news of our local tailor had reached her in kansas type 2 diabetes he had to have his leg amputated so sad the international burden of diabetes is a much-told news story new data from the international diabetes federation estimates that 415 million people in the world have diabetes by 2040, the figure is expected to grow to 642 million thats an estimated one in 10 of the world population currently as much as 12% of total health expenditure goes on treating the disease india has, until it was surpassed by china, been called the diabetes capital of the world, with an estimated 50 million people having type 2 diabetes and worryingly, according to the world health organisation (who), that figure will only get worse - to an estimated 87 million people with the disease in the country by 2030 type 2 diabetes diabetes is a condition that causes a persons blood sugar to become too high at decembers global diabetes summit in berlin, dr sanjay kalra and his colleague dr ashok k das delivered a speech where they called type 2 diabetes a ticking time bomb for india we need to understand and address the psychosocial domain of diabetes - not just the biomedical facts, dr kalra told me hiv is caused by relatively few high risk behaviours for diabetes, high risk behaviours impact every sphere of life indian society frowns upon iv drug use and extramarital sex, but happily encourages unhealthy food and promotes inactivity (cars, escalators, remote control for tv) following our interview, dr kalra contacted me via whatsapp to offer a few extra facts did i know that 11 january 2017 marks 95 years since the first insulin injection was administered in toronto? and urbanisation and stress leads to the disease, although it doesnt discriminate between classes or socioeconomic backgrounds and could i please remind our readers that reducing sugar and engaging in physical activity like yoga or something fun, like punjabi folk dancing or bhangra, will go a long way towards reducing the condition back on the side of the road in calicut, i looked at padmanabhans boarded-up shop and back towards my aunt she smiled, and took my hand, like she had when i was a child, to walk me back to the house

Article - weve seen a lot of beautiful dresses, and its always interesting to see dresses made in unusual ways for example, one elementary school art teacher had her students decorate her dress with their own artwork the result was whimsical and beautiful, but we dont know that we would have been brave enough to let our elementary aged children decorate our clothing another example of a beautiful and unique dress is one that a teenager hand-painted and wore to her high school graduation party the result was simply spectacular then theres the story of a boyfriend who taught himself to sew so that he could make a prom dress for his date thats love in his case, it actually led to paying gigs! but, todays story is about toilet paper it doesnt really seem like the kind of material (can we even call it material?) that would be used for making clothing; however, one woman actually made a wedding dress out of toilet paper sure, toilet paper is white, but a wedding dress and toilet paper usually dont belong in the same sentence amber mills, a veteran marine, is used to challenges first of all, she was a marine second of all, she has multiple sclerosis shes also a mom mills decided to enter a toilet paper wedding dress contest from charmin, and she ended up getting the third place prize she boiled charmin brand toilet paper in a pot on her stove and mixed it with glue to create the dress this is the kind of thing you have to see to believe many people are impressed with mills dress and are even feeling inspired to do something creative themselves one person wrote, god bless you! i love your video amber! youre so inspirational! youve jump started my dormant fashion designer in me! i love this video! another comment reads, wow! thats the prettiest wedding dress ever! she should have gotten first place! so creative! i pray god blesses her with orders for wedding dresses! they will be one of a kind for sure! and absolutely beautiful! we have to agree that if she can create a wedding dress this beautiful out of toilet paper she could certainly do something even more amazing out of actual fabric

Article - after three winning quarters for the market, what will the fourth bring? if history repeats, stocks could be in for a sweet end to the year in the last seven years in which the s&p 500 rose in each of the first three quarters, only in one of them — 2007 — did the index drop in the fourth actually, when one looks at the entire performance history of the s&p 500 going back to 1928 (which is available despite the fact that the index was technically created in 1957) one finds that out of the 19 years in which the market rose in the first, second and third quarters, a negative fourth quarter only followed five times in these 19 years, the s&ps median performance was a 41 percent gain, according to a cnbc analysis of factset data that 74 percent win rate and impressive median gain for fourth quarters following three consecutive winning quarters compares to a 62 percent win rate for the s&p over all of its 355 quarters, and average quarterly performance of a 25 percent gain however, it is also the case that the fourth quarter just happens to be better for investors in general; the market rose in 73 percent of fourth quarters, and actually turned out a better median performance of a 45 percent gain the recent rises seen in fourth quarters can thus be ascribed to market seasonality — or, perhaps more credibly, to mere randomness but for the bullish strategist tom lee of fundstrat, who has pointed to similar figures in the past, something more is at work lee argues that in years when stocks are doing well, active managers will invest heavily in an attempt to avoid lagging the market too badly — creating an additional bullish force in the market the fact that 2016 has been a good year so far is therefore a reason to bet that stocks will rise, he concludes so will the fourth quarter, which begins on monday, continue the bullish trend? unfortunately, marshaling stats all day can obscure but can never alter the fact this question is patently unanswerable

Article - michael phelps photo: adam pretty critics and social media have predecessor critics and social media have savaged nbc ’s early coverage of the rio olympics — and the early ratings verdict from nielsen has not been any kinder viewership for the first three nights of the peacock’s prime-time broadcasts is down sharply compared to both the 2012 london and 2008 beijing games, with younger audiences bailing in particularly big numbers it’s not all bad news: tens of millions of americans are still watching the olympics, some viewing has likely shifted to online platforms not immediately measured by nielsen, and sunday’s swimming-centric schedule resulted in a big ratings surge but if the early pattern holds, rio will be the first summer olympics since sydney 2000 to score lower nielsen numbers than itspredecessor the first sign of trouble for nbc ’s rio ratings came saturday morning, when data for friday’s never-ending opening ceremony came in per nielsen, the minimalist curtain-raiser notched a 139 household rating (ie, the percentage of homes with tv sets tuned to the olympics) while that’s more than two times the audience for the typical episode of the summer’s no 1 series, nbc ’s america’s got talent , it represents an eye-popping 35 percent drop from night one of the london games (which notched a 210 rating) and the lowest rating for an opening ceremony in at least 20 years (the runner-up? athens 2004, which averaged a 146 rating) worse, the 139 rating is just barely ahead of the average edition of nbc ’s sunday night football last fall (129) rating things didn’t improve much on saturday, the first night of competition: nbc averaged an 114 for its prime-time broadcast, down about 28 percent from london’s 158 and another at least 20-year low part of the problem is big defections among millennial audiences, ie the audience segment most likely to be turned off by nbc ’s non-stop commercial breaks final numbers aren’t in yet, but among adults aged 18 to 34, it looks like friday’s opening was down around 43 percent compared to london (versus the aforementioned 35 percent decline among viewers of all ages) perhaps some of that audience shifted to nbc ’s livestream simulcast, but given how much of the network’s ad revenue is tied to linear ratings, that won’t be of much comfort to peacock accountants still, expect nbc to play up big gains for digital and other platforms when it releases so-called total audience measurement data later this week it’s also far too early to declare rio any sort of ratings disaster nbc ’s olympics ratings often rise and fall based on how well the us team is doing at any given time, and sunday’s stellar swimming performances by katie ledecky and michael phelps — telegraphed by social media ahead of their broadcast to american audiences — delivered a massive nielsen boost for nbc  early numbers show the network’s prime-time coverage jumping to a best-yet 159 household rating, the first time since athens 2004 that a night three of the olympics has come in ahead of the opening ceremonies what’s more, while viewership was still down compared to london, it fell a more modest 20 percent and looks to be above tune-in for the comparable nights in both athens and sydney if team usa can keep winning, nbc still has a shot at making up some of the losses from the first weekend of the games

he was originally charged with rape of an intoxicated person and rape of an unconscious person but those indictments were dropped at a preliminary hearing, reportedly after prosecutors received the results of dna testing as such, the case continued on the basis of ‘lesser’ charges: assault with intent to commit rape of an intoxicated or unconscious person; penetrating an intoxicated person with a foreign object; and penetrating an unconscious person with a foreign object in essence, californian state law defines rape as penetration by the penis since that did not occur turner is a criminal,

variation between jurisdictions, both with regard to the terminology used and the ranking of distinct types of sexual assault as to their seriousness california is among a handful of states which continue to criminalise ‘object penetration’ to a lesser degree than penile penetration even so, turner’s crimes could have seen him receive a maximum of 14 years in prison even putting aside the

security council resolution 1325 (2000) to ensure that women’s protection concerns are mainstreamed throughout its security operations i also call upon the authorities to guarantee security in and around internally displaced persons camps and to extend medical and psychosocial services to high-risk areas whether existing definitions are appropriate entirely depends on your point of view of course it is not an awfully long time ago that rape was regarded fundamentally not as a crime of violence against women, but as a crime against the property of men (ie their wives or daughters), which is why marital rape was for so long excluded we have – for the most part – moved on from the deepest depths of that patriarchal approach but there any many who argue that the maintenance of ‘phallo-centric’ rape definitions means that the seriousness of other forms of penetrative assault are underplayed brock turner’s conviction, and the bravely stark testimony of his victim, have helped to bring these questions about how sexual crimes are defined – and how that impacts on attitudes towards sentencing – out into the open the tragedy is that no level of public debate or outrage can undo the despicable harm he caused to an unconscious woman read the stanford victims full impact statement your honor, if it is all right, for the majority of this statement i would like to address the defendant directly you don’t know me, but you’ve been inside me, and that’s why we’re here today on january 17th, 2015, it was a quiet saturday night at home my dad made some dinner and i sat at the table with my younger sister who was visiting for the weekend i was working full time and it was approaching my bed time i planned to stay at home by myself, watch some tv and read, while she went to a party with her friends then, i decided it was my only night with her, i had nothing better to do, so why not, there’s a dumb party ten minutes from my house, i would go, dance weird like a fool, and embarrass my younger sister on the way there, i joked that undergrad guys would have braces my sister teased me for wearing a beige cardigan to a frat party like a librarian i called myself big mama, because i knew i’d be the oldest one there i made silly faces, let my guard down, and drank liquor too fast not factoring in that my tolerance had significantly lowered since college the next thing i remember i was in a gurney in a hallway i had dried blood and bandages on the backs of my hands and elbow i thought maybe i had fallen and was in an admin office on campus i was very calm and wondering where my sister was a deputy explained i had been assaulted i still remained calm, assured he was speaking to the wrong person i knew no one at this party when i was finally allowed to use the restroom, i pulled down the hospital pants they had given me, went to pull down my underwear, and felt nothing i still remember the feeling of my hands touching my skin and grabbing nothing i looked down and there was nothing the thin piece of fabric, the only thing between my vagina and anything else, was missing and everything inside me was silenced i still don’t have words for that feeling in order to keep breathing, i thought maybe the policemen used scissors to cut them off for evidence then, i felt pine needles scratching the back of my neck and started pulling them out my hair i thought maybe, the pine needles had fallen from a tree onto my head my brain was talking my gut into not collapsing because my gut was saying, help me, help me i shuffled from room to room with a blanket wrapped around me, pine needles trailing behind me, i left a little pile in every room i sat in i was asked to sign papers that said rape victim and i thought something has really happened my clothes were confiscated and i stood naked while the nurses held a ruler to various abrasions on my body and photographed them the three of us worked to comb the pine needles out of my hair, six hands to fill one paper bag to calm me down, they said it’s just the flora and fauna, flora and fauna i had multiple swabs inserted into my vagina and anus, needles for shots, pills, had a nikon pointed right into my spread legs i had long, pointed beaks inside me and had my vagina smeared with cold, blue paint to check for abrasions after a few hours of this, they let me shower i stood there examining my body beneath the stream of water and decided, i don’t want my body anymore i was terrified of it, i didn’t know what had been in it, if it had been contaminated, who had touched it i wanted to take off my body like a jacket and leave it at the hospital with everything else on that morning, all that i was told was that i had been found behind a dumpster, potentially penetrated by a stranger, and that i should get retested for hiv because results don’t always show up immediately but for now, i should go home and get back to my normal life imagine stepping back into the world with only that information they gave me huge hugs, and then i walked out of the hospital into the parking lot wearing the new sweatshirt and sweatpants they provided me, as they had only allowed me to keep my necklace and shoes my sister picked me up, face wet from tears and contorted in anguish instinctively and immediately, i wanted to take away her pain i smiled at her, i told her to look at me, i’m right here, i’m okay, everything’s okay, i’m right here my hair is washed and clean, they gave me the strangest shampoo, calm down, and look at me look at these funny new sweatpants and sweatshirt, i look like a pe teacher, let’s go home, let’s eat something she did not know that beneath my sweats, i had scratches and bandages on my skin, my vagina was sore and had become a strange, dark color from all the prodding, my underwear was missing, and i felt too empty to continue to speak that i was also afraid, that i was also devastated that day we drove home and for hours my sister held me my boyfriend did not know what happened, but called that day and said, i was really worried about you last night, you scared me, did you make it home okay? i was horrified that’s when i learned i had called him that night in my blackout, left an incomprehensible voicemail, that we had also spoken on the phone, but i was slurring so heavily he was scared for me, that he repeatedly told me to go find my sister again, he asked me, what happened last night? did you make it home okay? i said yes, and hung up to cry i was not ready to tell my boyfriend or parents that actually, i may have been raped behind a dumpster, but i don’t know by who or when or how if i told them, i would see the fear on their faces, and mine would multiply by tenfold, so instead i pretended the whole thing wasn’t real i tried to push it out of my mind, but it was so heavy i didn’t talk, i didn’t eat, i didn’t sleep, i didn’t interact with anyone after work, i would drive to a secluded place to scream i didn’t talk, i didn’t eat, i didn’t sleep, i didn’t interact with anyone, and i became isolated from the ones i loved most for one week after the incident, i didn’t get any calls or updates about that night or what happened to me the only symbol that proved that it hadn’t just been a bad dream, was the sweatshirt from the hospital in my drawer one day, i was at work, scrolling through the news on my phone, and came across an article in it, i read and learned for the first time about how i was found unconscious, with my hair disheveled, long necklace wrapped around my neck, bra pulled out of my dress, dress pulled off over my shoulders and pulled up above my waist, that i was butt naked all the way down to my boots, legs spread apart, and had been penetrated by a foreign object by someone i did not recognize this was how i learned what happened to me, sitting at my desk reading the news at work i learned what happened to me the same time everyone else in the world learned what happened to me that’s when the pine needles in my hair made sense, they didn’t fall from a tree he had taken off my underwear, his fingers had been inside of me i don’t even know this person i still don’t know this person when i read about me like this, i said, this can’t be me this can’t be me i could not digest or accept any of this information i could not imagine my family having to read about this online i kept reading in the next paragraph, i read something that i will never forgive; i read that according to him, i liked it i liked it again, i do not have words for these feelings at the bottom of the article, after i learned about the graphic details of my own sexual assault, the article listed his swimming times she was found breathing, unresponsive with her underwear six inches away from her bare stomach curled in fetal position by the way, he’s really good at swimming throw in my mile time if that’s what we’re doing i’m good at cooking, put that in there, i think the end is where you list your extra-curriculars to cancel out all the sickening things that’ve happened the night the news came out i sat my parents down and told them that i had been assaulted, to not look at the news because it’s upsetting, just know that i’m okay, i’m right here, and i’m okay but halfway through telling them, my mom had to hold me because i could no longer stand up i was not okay the night after it happened, he said he didn’t know my name, said he wouldn’t be able to identify my face in a lineup, didn’t mention any dialogue between us, no words, only dancing and kissing dancing is a cute term; was it snapping fingers and twirling dancing, or just bodies grinding up against each other in a crowded room? i wonder if kissing was just faces sloppily pressed up against each other? when the detective asked if he had planned on taking me back to his dorm, he said no when the detective asked how we ended up behind the dumpster, he said he didn’t know he admitted to kissing other girls at that party, one of whom was my own sister who pushed him away he admitted to wanting to hook up with someone i was the wounded antelope of the herd, completely alone and vulnerable, physically unable to fend for myself, and he chose me sometimes i think, if i hadn’t gone, then this never would’ve happened but then i realized, it would have happened, just to somebody else you were about to enter four years of access to drunk girls and parties, and if this is the foot you started off on, then it is right you did not continue the night after it happened, he said he thought i liked it because i rubbed his back a back rub never mentioned me voicing consent, never mentioned us speaking, a back rub one more time, in public news, i learned that my ass and vagina were completely exposed outside, my breasts had been groped, fingers had been jabbed inside me along with pine needles and debris, my bare skin and head had been rubbing against the ground behind a dumpster, while an erect freshman was humping my half naked, unconscious body but i don’t remember, so how do i prove i didn’t like it i thought there’s no way this is going to trial; there were witnesses, there was dirt in my body, he ran but was caught he’s going to settle, formally apologize, and we will both move on instead, i was told he hired a powerful attorney, expert witnesses, private investigators who were going to try and find details about my personal life to use against me, find loopholes in my story to invalidate me and my sister, in order to show that this sexual assault was in fact a misunderstanding that he was going to go to any length to convince the world he had simply been confused i was not only told that i was assaulted, i was told that because i couldn’t remember, i technically could not prove it was unwanted and that distorted me, damaged me, almost broke me it is the saddest type of confusion to be told i was assaulted and nearly raped, blatantly out in the open, but we don’t know if it counts as assault yet i had to fight for an entire year to make it clear that there was something wrong with this situation when i was told to be prepared in case we didn’t win, i said, i can’t prepare for that he was guilty the minute i woke up no one can talk me out of the hurt he caused me worst of all, i was warned, because he now knows you don’t remember, he is going to get to write the script he can say whatever he wants and no one can contest it i had no power, i had no voice, i was defenseless my memory loss would be used against me my testimony was weak, was incomplete, and i was made to believe that perhaps, i am not enough to win this that’s so damaging his attorney constantly reminded the jury, the only one we can believe is brock, because she doesn’t remember that helplessness was traumatizing instead of taking time to heal, i was taking time to recall the night in excruciating detail, in order to prepare for the attorney’s questions that would be invasive, aggressive, and designed to steer me off course, to contradict myself, my sister, phrased in ways to manipulate my answers instead of his attorney saying, did you notice any abrasions? he said, you didn’t notice any abrasions, right? this was a game of strategy, as if i could be tricked out of my own worth the sexual assault had been so clear, but instead, here i was at the trial, answering question like: how old are you? how much do you weigh? what did you eat that day? well what did you have for dinner? who made dinner? did you drink with dinner? no, not even water? when did you drink? how much did you drink? what container did you drink out of? who gave you the drink? how much do you usually drink? who dropped you off at this party? at what time? but where exactly? what were you wearing? why were you going to this party? what’d you do when you got there? are you sure you did that? but what time did you do that? what does this text mean? who were you texting? when did you urinate? where did you urinate? with whom did you urinate outside? was your phone on silent when your sister called? do you remember silencing it? really because on page 53 i’d like to point out that you said it was set to ring did you drink in college? you said you were a party animal? how many times did you black out? did you party at frats? are you serious with your boyfriend? are you sexually active with him? when did you start dating? would you ever cheat? do you have a history of cheating? what do you mean when you said you wanted to reward him? do you remember what time you woke up? were you wearing your cardigan? what color was your cardigan? do you remember any more from that night? no? okay, we’ll let brock fill it in i was pummeled with narrowed, pointed questions that dissected my personal life, love life, past life, family life, inane questions, accumulating trivial details to try and find an excuse for this guy who didn’t even take the time to ask me for my name, who had me naked a handful of minutes after seeing me after a physical assault, i was assaulted with questions designed to attack me, to say see, her facts don’t line up, she’s out of her mind, she’s practically an alcoholic, she probably wanted to hook up, he’s like an athlete right, they were both drunk, whatever, the hospital stuff she remembers is after the fact, why take it into account, brock has a lot at stake so he’s having a really hard time right now and then it came time for him to testify this is where i became revictimized i want to remind you, the night after it happened he said he never planned to take me back to his dorm he said he didn’t know why we were behind a dumpster he got up to leave because he wasn’t feeling well when he was suddenly chased and attacked then he learned i could not remember so one year later, as predicted, a new dialogue emerged brock had a strange new story, almost sounded like a poorly written young adult novel with kissing and dancing and hand holding and lovingly tumbling onto the ground, and most importantly in this new story, there was suddenly consent one year after the incident, he remembered, oh yeah, by the way she actually said yes, to everything, so he said he had asked if i wanted to dance apparently i said yes he’d asked if i wanted to go to his dorm, i said yes then he asked if he could finger me and i said yes most guys don’t ask, can i finger you? usually there’s a natural progression of things, unfolding consensually, not a q and a but apparently i granted full permission he’s in the clear even in this story, there’s barely any dialogue; i only said a total of three words before he had me half naked on the ground i have never been penetrated after three words he didn’t claim to hear me speak one full sentence that night, so in the news when it says we met, i’m not sure i would go so far as to say that future reference, if you are confused about whether a girl can consent, see if she can speak an entire sentence you couldn’t even do that just one coherent string of words if she can’t do that, then no don’t touch her, just no not maybe, just no where was the confusion? this is common sense, human decency according to him, the only reason we were on the ground was because i fell down note; if a girl falls help her get back up if she is too drunk to even walk and falls, do not mount her, hump her, take off her underwear, and insert your hand inside her vagina if a girl falls help her up if she is wearing a cardigan over her dress don’t take it off so that you can touch her breasts maybe she is cold, maybe that’s why she wore the cardigan if her bare ass and legs are rubbing the pinecones and needles, while the weight of you pushes into her, get off her next in the story, two people approached you you ran because you said you felt scared i argue that you were scared because you’d be caught, not because you were scared of two terrifying swedish grad students the idea that you thought you were being attacked out of the blue was ludicrous that it had nothing to do with you being on top my unconscious body you were caught red handed, with no explanation when they tackled you why didn’t [you] say, stop! everything’s okay, go ask her, she’s right over there, she’ll tell you i mean you had just asked for my consent, right? i was awake, right? when the policeman arrived and interviewed the evil swede who tackled you, he was crying so hard he couldn’t speak because of what he’d seen also, if you really did think they were dangerous, you just abandoned a half-naked girl to run and save yourself no matter which way you frame it, it doesn’t make sense your attorney has repeatedly pointed out, well we don’t know exactly when she became unconscious and you’re right, maybe i was still fluttering my eyes and wasn’t completely limp yet, fine his guilt did not depend on him knowing the exact second that i became unconscious, that is never what this was about i was slurring, too drunk to consent way before i was on the ground i should have never been touched in the first place brock stated, at no time did i see that she was not responding if at any time i thought she was not responding, i would have stopped immediately here’s the thing; if your plan was to stop only when i was literally unresponsive, then you still do not understand you didn’t even stop when i was unconscious anyway! someone else stopped you two guys on bikes noticed i wasn’t moving in the dark and had to tackle you how did you not notice while on top of me? you said, you would have stopped and gotten help you say that, but i want you to explain how you would’ve helped me, step by step, walk me through this i want to know, if those evil swedes had not found me, how the night would have played out i am asking you; would you have pulled my underwear back on over my boots? untangled the necklace wrapped around my neck? closed my legs, covered me? tucked my bra back into my dress? would you have helped me pick the needles from my hair? asked if the abrasions on my neck and bottom hurt? would you then go find a friend and say, will you help me get her somewhere warm and soft? i don’t sleep when i think about the way it could have gone if the swedes had never come what would have happened to me? that’s what you’ll never have a good answer for, that’s what you can’t explain even after a year to sit under oath and inform all of us, that yes i wanted it, yes i permitted it, and that you are the true victim attacked by guys for reasons unknown to you is sick, is demented, is selfish, is stupid it shows that you were willing to go to any length, to discredit me, invalidate me, and explain why it was okay to hurt me you tried unyieldingly to save yourself, your reputation, at my expense my family had to see pictures of my head strapped to a gurney full of pine needles, of my body in the dirt with my eyes closed, dress hiked up, limbs limp in the dark and then even after that, my family had to listen to your attorney say, the pictures were after the fact, we can dismiss them to say, yes her nurse confirmed there was redness and abrasions inside her, but that’s what happens when you finger someone, and he’s already admitted to that to listen to him use my own sister against me to listen him attempt to paint of a picture of me, the seductive party animal, as if somehow that would make it so that i had this coming for me to listen to him say i sounded drunk on the phone because i’m silly and that’s my goofy way of speaking to point out that in the voicemail, i said i would reward my boyfriend and we all know what i was thinking i assure you my rewards program is non-transferable, especially to any nameless man that approaches me the point is, this is everything my family and i endured during the trial this is everything i had to sit through silently, taking it, while he shaped the evening it is enough to be suffering it is another thing to have someone ruthlessly working to diminish the gravity and validity of this suffering but in the end, his unsupported statements and his attorney’s twisted logic fooled no one the truth won, the truth spoke for itself you are guilty twelve jurors convicted you guilty of three felony counts beyond reasonable doubt, that’s twelve votes per count, thirty-six yeses confirming guilt, that’s one hundred percent, unanimous guilt and i thought finally it is over, finally he will own up to what he did, truly apologize, we will both move on and get better then i read your statement if you are hoping that one of my organs will implode from anger and i will die, i’m almost there you are very close assault is not an accident this is not a story of another drunk college hookup with poor decision making somehow, you still don’t get it somehow, you still sound confused i will now take this opportunity to read portions of the defendant’s statement and respond to them you said, being drunk i just couldn’t make the best decisions and neither could she alcohol is not an excuse is it a factor? yes but alcohol was not the one who stripped me, fingered me, had my head dragging against the ground, with me almost fully naked having too much to drink was an amateur mistake that i admit to, but it is not criminal everyone in this room has had a night where they have regretted drinking too much, or knows someone close to them who has had a night where they have regretted drinking too much regretting drinking is not the same as regretting sexual assault we were both drunk, the difference is i did not take off your pants and underwear, touch you inappropriately, and run away that’s the difference you said, if i wanted to get to know her, i should have asked for her number, rather than asking her to go back to my room i’m not mad because you didn’t ask for my number even if you did know me, i would not want [to] be in this situation my own boyfriend knows me, but if he asked to finger me behind a dumpster, i would slap him no girl wants to be in this situation nobody i don’t care if you know their phone number or not you said, i stupidly thought it was okay for me to do what everyone around me was doing, which was drinking i was wrong again, you were not wrong for drinking everyone around you was not sexually assaulting me you were wrong for doing what nobody else was doing, which was pushing your erect dick in your pants against my naked, defenseless body concealed in a dark area, where partygoers could no longer see or protect me, and own my sister could not find me sipping fireball is not your crime peeling off and discarding my underwear like a candy wrapper to insert your finger into my body, is where you went wrong why am i still explaining this you said, during the trial i didn’t want to victimize her at all that was just my attorney and his way of approaching the case your attorney is not your scapegoat, he represents you did your attorney say some incredulously infuriating, degrading things? absolutely he said you had an erection, because it was cold i have no words you said, you are in the process of establishing a program for high school and college students in which you speak about your experience to speak out against the college campus drinking culture and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that speak out against campus drinking culture that’s what we’re speaking out against? you think that’s what i’ve spent the past year fighting for? not awareness about campus sexual assault, or rape, or learning to recognize consent campus drinking culture down with jack daniels down with skyy vodka if you want talk to high school kids about drinking go to an aa meeting you realize, having a drinking problem is different than drinking and then forcefully trying to have sex with someone? show men how to respect women, not how to drink less drinking culture and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that goes along with that, like a side effect, like fries on the side of your order where does promiscuity even come into play? i don’t see headlines that read, brock turner, guilty of drinking too much and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that campus [sexual] assault there’s your first powerpoint slide i have done enough explaining you do not get to shrug your shoulders and be confused anymore you do not get to pretend that there were no red flags you do not get to not know why you ran you have been convicted of violating me with malicious intent, and all you can admit to is consuming alcohol do not talk about the sad way your life was upturned because alcohol made you do bad things figure out how to take responsibility for your own conduct lastly you said, i want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin a life ruin a life, one life, yours, you forgot about mine let me rephrase for you, i want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin two lives you and me you are the cause, i am the effect you have dragged me through this hell with you, dipped me back into that night again and again you knocked down both our towers, i collapsed at the same time you did your damage was concrete; stripped of titles, degrees, enrollment my damage was internal, unseen, i carry it with me you took away my worth, my privacy, my energy, my time, my safety, my intimacy, my confidence, my own voice, until today see one thing we have in common is that we were both unable to get up in the morning i am no stranger to suffering you made me a victim in newspapers my name was unconscious intoxicated woman, ten syllables, and nothing more than that for a while, i believed that that was all i was i had to force myself to relearn my real name, my identity to relearn that this is not all that i am that i am not just a drunk victim at a frat party found behind a dumpster, while you are the all-american swimmer at a top university, innocent until proven guilty, with so much at stake i am a human being who has been irreversibly hurt, who waited a year to figure out if i was worth something my independence, natural joy, gentleness, and steady lifestyle i had been enjoying became distorted beyond recognition i became closed off, angry, self-deprecating, tired, irritable, empty the isolation at times was unbearable you cannot give me back the life i had before that night either while you worry about your shattered reputation, i refrigerated spoons every night so when i woke up, and my eyes were puffy from crying, i would hold the spoons to my eyes to lessen the swelling so that i could see i showed up an hour late to work every morning, excused myself to cry in the stairwells, i can tell you all the best places in that building to cry where no one can hear you, the pain became so bad that i had to tell my boss i was leaving, i needed time because continuing day to day was not possible i used my savings to go as far away as i could possibly be i can’t sleep alone at night without having a light on, like a five year old, because i have nightmares of being touched where i cannot wake up, i did this thing where i waited until the sun came up and i felt safe enough to sleep for three months, i went to bed at six o’clock in the morning i used to pride myself on my independence, now i am afraid to go on walks in the evening, to attend social events with drinking among friends where i should be comfortable being i have become a little barnacle always needing to be at someone’s side, to have my boyfriend standing next to me, sleeping beside me, protecting me it is embarrassing how feeble i feel, how timidly i move through life, always guarded, ready to defend myself, ready to be angry you have no idea how hard i have worked to rebuild parts of me that are still weak it took me eight months to even talk about what happened i could no longer connect with friends, with everyone around me i would scream at my boyfriend, my own family whenever they brought this up you never let me forget what happened to me at the of end of the hearing, the trial, i was too tired to speak i would leave drained, silent i would go home turn off my phone and for days i would not speak you bought me a ticket to a planet where i lived by myself every time a new article [would] come out, i lived with the paranoia that my entire hometown would find out and know me as the girl who got assaulted i didn’t want anyone’s pity and am still learning to accept victim as part of my identity you made my own hometown an uncomfortable place to be someday, you can pay me back for my ambulance ride and therapy but you cannot give me back my sleepless nights the way i have broken down sobbing uncontrollably if i’m watching a movie and a woman is harmed, to say it lightly, this experience has expanded my empathy for other victims i have lost weight from stress, when people would comment i told them i’ve been running a lot lately there are times i did not want to be touched i have to relearn that i am not fragile, i am capable, i am wholesome, not just livid and weak i want to say this all the crying, the hurting you have imposed on me, i can take it but when i see my younger sister hurting, when she is unable to keep up in school, when she is deprived of joy, when she is not sleeping, when she is crying so hard on the phone she is barely breathing, telling me over and over she is sorry for leaving me alone that night, sorry sorry sorry, when she feels more guilt than you, then i do not forgive you that night i had called her to try and find her, but you found me first your attorney’s closing statement began, my sister said she was fine and who knows her better than her sister you tried to use my own sister against me your points of attack were so weak, so low, it was almost embarrassing you do not touch her if you think i was spared, came out unscathed, that today i ride off into sunset, while you suffer the greatest blow, you are mistaken nobody wins we have all been devastated, we have all been trying to find some meaning in all of this suffering you should have never done this to me secondly, you should have never made me fight so long to tell you, you should have never done this to me but here we are the damage is done, no one can undo it and now we both have a choice we can let this destroy us, i can remain angry and hurt and you can be in denial, or we can face it head on, i accept the pain, you accept the punishment, and we move on your life is not over, you have decades of years ahead to rewrite your story the world is huge, it is so much bigger than palo alto and stanford, and you will make a space for yourself in it where you can be useful and happy right now your name is tainted, so i challenge you to make a new name for yourself, to do something so good for the world, it blows everyone away you have a brain and a voice and a heart use them wisely you possess immense love from your family that alone can pull you out of anything mine has held me up through all of this yours will hold you and you will go on i believe, that one day, you will understand all of this better i hope you will become a better more honest person who can properly use this story to prevent another story like this from ever happening again i fully support your journey to healing, to rebuilding your life, because that is the only way you’ll begin to help others now to address the sentencing when i read the probation officer’s report, i was in disbelief, consumed by anger which eventually quieted down to profound sadness my statements have been slimmed down to distortion and taken out of context i fought hard during this trial and will not have the outcome minimized by a probation officer who attempted to evaluate my current state and my wishes in a fifteen minute conversation, the majority of which was spent answering questions i had about the legal system the context is also important brock had yet to issue a statement, and i had not read his remarks my life has been on hold for over a year, a year of anger, anguish and uncertainty, until a jury of my peers rendered a judgment that validated the injustices i had endured had brock admitted guilt and remorse and offered to settle early on, i would have considered a lighter sentence, respecting his honesty, grateful to be able to move our lives forward instead he took the risk of going to trial, added insult to injury and forced me to relive the hurt as details about my personal life and sexual assault were brutally dissected before the public he pushed me and my family through a year of inexplicable, unnecessary suffering, and should face the consequences of challenging his crime, of putting my pain into question, of making us wait so long for justice i told the probation officer i do not want brock to rot away in prison i did not say he does not deserve to be behind bars the probation officer’s recommendation of a year or less in county jail is a soft time-out, a mockery of the seriousness of his assaults, and of the consequences of the pain i have been forced to endure i also told the probation officer that what i truly wanted was for brock to get it, to understand and admit to his wrongdoing unfortunately, after reading the defendant’s statement, i am severely disappointed and feel that he has failed to exhibit sincere remorse or responsibility for his conduct i fully respected his right to a trial, but even after twelve jurors unanimously convicted him guilty of three felonies, all he has admitted to doing is ingesting alcohol someone who cannot take full accountability for his actions does not deserve a mitigating sentence it is deeply offensive that he would try and dilute rape with a suggestion of promiscuity by definition rape is the absence of promiscuity, rape is the absence of consent, and it perturbs me deeply that he can’t even see that distinction the probation officer factored in that the defendant is youthful and has no prior convictions in my opinion, he is old enough to know what he did was wrong when you are eighteen in this country you can go to war when you are nineteen, you are old enough to pay the consequences for attempting to rape someone he is young, but he is old enough to know better as this is a first offense i can see where leniency would beckon on the other hand, as a society, we cannot forgive everyone’s first sexual assault or digital rape it doesn’t make sense the seriousness of rape has to be communicated clearly, we should not create a culture that suggests we learn that rape is wrong through trial and error the consequences of sexual assault needs to be severe enough that people feel enough fear to exercise good judgment even if they are drunk, severe enough to be preventative the fact that brock was a star athlete at a prestigious university should not be seen as an entitlement to leniency, but as an opportunity to send a strong cultural message that sexual assault is against the law regardless of social class the probation officer weighed the fact that he has surrendered a hard earned swimming scholarship if i had been sexually assaulted by an un-athletic guy from a community college, what would his sentence be? if a first time offender from an underprivileged background was accused of three felonies and displayed no accountability for his actions other than drinking, what would his sentence be? how fast he swims does not lessen the impact of what happened to me the probation officer has stated that this case, when compared to other crimes of similar nature, may be considered less serious due to the defendant’s level of intoxication it felt serious that’s all i’m going to say he is a lifetime sex registrant that doesn’t expire just like what he did to me doesn’t expire, doesn’t just go away after a set number of years it stays with me, it’s part of my identity, it has forever changed the way i carry myself, the way i live the rest of my life a year has gone by and he has had lots of time on his hands has he been seeing a psychologist? what has he done in this past year to show he’s been progressing? if he says he wants to implement programs, what has he done to show for it? throughout incarceration i hope he is provided with appropriate therapy and resources to rebuild his life i request that he educates himself about the issue of campus sexual assault i hope he accepts proper punishment and pushes himself to reenter society as a better person to conclude, i want to say thank you to everyone from the intern who made me oatmeal when i woke up at the hospital that morning, to the deputy who waited beside me, to the nurses who calmed me, to the detective who listened to me and never judged me, to my advocates who stood unwaveringly beside me, to my therapist who taught me to find courage in vulnerability, to my boss for being kind and understanding, to my incredible parents who teach me how to turn pain into strength, to my friends who remind me how to be happy, to my boyfriend who is patient and loving, to my unconquerable sister who is the other half of my heart, to alaleh, my idol, who fought tirelessly and never doubted me thank you to everyone involved in the trial for their time and attention thank you to girls across the nation that wrote cards to my da to give to me, so many strangers who cared for me most importantly, thank you to the two men who saved me, who i have yet to meet i sleep with two bicycles that i drew taped above my bed to remind myself there are heroes in this story that we are looking out for one another to have known all of these people, to have felt their protection and love, is something i will never forget and finally, to girls everywhere, i am with you on nights when you feel alone, i am with you when people doubt you or dismiss you, i am with you i fought everyday for you so never stop fighting, i believe you lighthouses don’t go running all over an island looking for boats to save; they just stand there shining although i can’t save every boat, i hope that by speaking today, you absorbed a small amount of light, a small knowing that you can’t be silenced, a small satisfaction that justice was served, a small assurance that we are getting somewhere, and a big, big knowing that you are important, unquestionably, you are untouchable, you are beautiful, you are to be valued, respected, undeniably, every minute of every day, you are powerful and nobody can take that away from you to girls everywhere, i am with you thank you

and you say something like, i want to be happy and have a great family and a job i like, it’s so ubiquitous that it doesn’t even mean anything a more interesting question, a question that perhaps you’ve never considered before, is what pain do you want in your life? what are you willing to struggle for? because that seems to be a greater determinant of how our lives turn out everybody wants to have an amazing job and financial independence—but not everyone wants to suffer through 60-hour work weeks, long commutes, obnoxious paperwork, to navigate arbitrary corporate hierarchies and the blasé confines of an infinite cubicle hell people want to be rich without the risk, without the sacrifice, without the delayed gratification necessary to accumulate wealth everybody wants to have great sex and an awesome relationship—but not everyone is willing to go through the tough conversations, the awkward silences, the hurt feelings and the emotional psychodrama to get there and so they settle they settle and wonder what if? for years and years and until the question morphs from what if? into was that it? and when the lawyers go home and the alimony check is in the mail they say, what was that for? if not for their lowered standards and expectations 20 years prior, then what for? because happiness requires struggle the positive is the side effect of handling the negative you can only avoid negative experiences for so long before they come roaring back to life at the core of all human behavior, our needs are more or less similar positive experience is easy to handle it’s negative experience that we all, by definition, struggle with therefore, what we get out of life is not determined by the good feelings we desire but by what bad feelings we’re willing and able to sustain to get us to those good feelings people want an amazing physique but you don’t end up with one unless you legitimately appreciate the pain and physical stress that comes with living inside a gym for hour upon hour, unless you love calculating and calibrating the food you eat, planning your life out in tiny plate-sized portions people want to start their own business or become financially independent but you don’t end up a successful entrepreneur unless you find a way to appreciate the risk, the uncertainty, the repeated failures, and working insane hours on something you have no idea whether will be successful or not people want a partner, a spouse but you don’t end up attracting someone amazing without appreciating the emotional turbulence that comes with weathering rejections, building the sexual tension that never gets released, and staring blankly at a phone that never rings it’s part of the game of love you can’t win if you don’t play what determines your success isn’t what do you want to enjoy? the question is, what pain do you want to sustain? the quality of your life is not determined by the quality of your positive experiences but the quality of your negative experiences and to get good at dealing with negative experiences is to get good at dealing with life there’s a lot of crappy advice out there that says, you’ve just got to want it enough! everybody wants something and everybody wants something enough they just aren’t aware of what it is they want, or rather, what they want enough because if you want the benefits of something in life, you have to also want the costs if you want the beach body, you have to want the sweat, the soreness, the early mornings, and the hunger pangs if you want the yacht, you have to also want the late nights, the risky business moves, and the possibility of pissing off a person or ten thousand if you find yourself wanting something month after month, year after year, yet nothing happens and you never come any closer to it, then maybe what you actually want is a fantasy, an idealization, an image and a false promise maybe what you want isn’t what you want, you just enjoy wanting maybe you don’t actually want it at all sometimes i ask people, how do you choose to suffer? these people tilt their heads and look at me like i have twelve noses but i ask because that tells me far more about you than your desires and fantasies because you have to choose something you can’t have a pain-free life it can’t all be roses and unicorns and ultimately that’s the hard question that matters pleasure is an easy question and pretty much all of us have similar answers the more interesting question is the pain what is the pain that you want to sustain? that answer will actually get you somewhere it’s the question that can change your life it’s what makes me me and you you it’s what defines us and separates us and ultimately brings us together for most of my adolescence and young adulthood, i fantasized about being a musician — a rock star, in particular any badass guitar song i heard, i would always close my eyes and envision myself up on stage playing it to the screams of the crowd, people absolutely losing their minds to my sweet finger-noodling this fantasy could keep me occupied for hours on end the fantasizing continued up through college, even after i dropped out of music school and stopped playing seriously but even then it was never a question of if i’d ever be up playing in front of screaming crowds, but when i was biding my time before i could invest the proper amount of time and effort into getting out there and making it work first, i needed to finish school then, i needed to make money then, i needed to find the time then  and then nothing despite fantasizing about this for over half of my life, the reality never came and it took me a long time and a lot of negative experiences to finally figure out why: i didn’t actually want it i was in love with the result—the image of me on stage, people cheering, me rocking out, pouring my heart into what i’m playing—but i wasn’t in love with the process and because of that, i failed at it repeatedly hell, i didn’t even try hard enough to fail at it i hardly tried at all the daily drudgery of practicing, the logistics of finding a group and rehearsing, the pain of finding gigs and actually getting people to show up and give a shit the broken strings, the blown tube amp, hauling 40 pounds of gear to and from rehearsals with no car it’s a mountain of a dream and a mile-high climb to the top and what it took me a long time to discover is that i didn’t like to climb much i just liked to imagine the top our culture would tell me that i’ve somehow failed myself, that i’m a quitter or a loser self-help would say that i either wasn’t courageous enough, determined enough or i didn’t believe in myself enough the entrepreneurial/start-up crowd would tell me that i chickened out on my dream and gave in to my conventional social conditioning i’d be told to do affirmations or join a mastermind group or manifest or something but the truth is far less interesting than that: i thought i wanted something, but it turns out i didn’t end of story i wanted the reward and not the struggle i wanted the result and not the process i was in love not with the fight but only the victory and life doesn’t work that way who you are is defined by the values you are willing to struggle for people who enjoy the struggles of a gym are the ones who get in good shape people who enjoy long workweeks and the politics of the corporate ladder are the ones who move up it people who enjoy the stresses and uncertainty of the starving artist lifestyle are ultimately the ones who live it and make it this is not a call for willpower or grit this is not another admonishment of no pain, no gain this is the most simple and basic component of life: our struggles determine our successes so choose your struggles wisely, my friend this post originally appeared on markmansonnet follow @iammarkmanson on twitter

Article_Title - the one strange word youre seeing/hearing everyone use right now
Article - not long after noticing friends and coworkers using slash in everyday conversation, i started seeing it cropping up everywhere, all the time either spelled out in five characters (slash) or just one (/), i saw it used to tack on subsequent ideas that could have been expressed in other, perfectly conventional ways but they werent it was invading texts, instant messages, email and even in-person dialogue the slash was being vocalized where it might otherwise appear in written form, integrated smoothly into audible discussion since we arent yet giving other punctuation the same treatment (hello exclamation point still sounds odd), it didnt make much sense after so much time being delegated to such boring utilitarian functions as dates (8/30/2014) and fractions (3/4 cup), the humble slash mark seems to be getting a linguistic makeover anne curzan, professor of english at the university of michigan, described the practice among students in her classroom last year since then, curzan told me in an email, shes been studying examples of slash usage on twitter the most common use corresponds most closely to and/or, but she said a fair number are used to connect one idea to another, perhaps meaning something like following up or as something like a spoken semi-colon still, other examples use the slash as a way to indicate truth values for the elements it connects, curzan explained in other words, saying one thing when what you really mean is the next like saying you need to rest when what youre really planning is binge-watching tv grammatically speaking, outside of its role as punctuation, the slash also functions as a coordinator coordinators, also called coordinating conjunctions, include and, but, or and other words that function to link independent and dependent clauses english speakers are pretty comfortable with this idea, as geoffrey k pullum, professor of linguistics at the university of edinburgh, explained on his blog back in 2010 for example, we might invite our friend/roommate to go see boyhood while planning to stuff our purse/backpack/pockets with cheap candy our meaning is clear the person with whom we share a responsibility for rent is also our friend, and whatever discreet container we bring to the theater will help us avoid paying five dollars for a box of sour patch kids the slash helps us present alternative descriptions pullum suggested, however, that it really only makes sense in lexical rather than phrasal categories with clauses, he wrote, i think there is no possibility of using it at all: consider i think im having hallucinations slash someone is playing tricks on me doesnt seem like english at all, does it? these days, many english speakers would disagree curzan explicitly noted that the slash can now be used to connect full clauses the most interesting implication to me, she said, is that this coordinator is expanding in use  and taking on new meanings usage guidelines are, of course, still very restrictive in formal writing when the style guides and writers handbooks i consulted mentioned the slash at all, they called it rarely necessary a 1977 edition of theodore bernsteins the careful writer referred to the simple and/or as a visual and mental monstrosity that should be avoided tell that to anyone who considers themselves a slash dj, to indicate their interest in the turntable arts outside of a regular nine-to-five (writer-slash-dj financial-consultant-slash-dj animal-whisperer-slash-dj) or to jezebel editor kara brown, who described robin thickes paula as the singers most recent album slash lame ass attempt at gaining publicity saving his marriage while itd be difficult to pin down exactly why we started going slash-crazy, it sure seems to correspond nicely with our culture of digital communication abbreviated by a lack of time or screen space or both, our technology has allowed instant messaging to flourish, so we might make our always-important thoughts known as quickly as possible the slash works as a stand-in, whether written or spoken, helping the writer express multiple ideas without going through the trouble of stringing them together using appropriate grammar, or else risking a series of awkwardly short bullet-point sentences however strange im going for a run slash walk in the park sounds to your ear, it gets across the same basic message as the much wordier alternative, im going to run in the park but probably do a fair amount of walking, too, because running is hard using slash assigned more truth value to walk over run the slash gives us a perfect opportunity to say two or more things at once like this, especially if one or more of those things is our own unsolicited snarky commentary (friendship slash rivalry review slash indictment) in digital scenarios where time is of the essence, it might seem counterintuitive that typing slash in the written form would so often take the place of the shorter and equally comprehensible and or or if convenience is such a concern so maybe it speaks, then, to our comfort with digital communication tools like keyboards and touch screens typing is second nature to us, and the slash is an almost mindlessly simple way to link our related thoughts its a match made in, um, some factory in china breakfast slash lunch! yum! @ maxs restaurant, sm mall of asia http://tco/osswgvkla4 — uriel yu medellin (@itsmeuriel) august 4, 2014 but will it stick around? we cant say to certain linguists, though, change is actually a great sign change means that people are using a language, and using a language keeps it healthy (theres not a lot of new slang being formed, for example, in latin) but everyone owns the english language -- or, maybe, no one does -- and were not that great at sharing if it is, in fact, here to stay, some grammar-sticklers will undoubtedly be scandalized at the prospect of a new coordinator, which curzan called a category of words that doesnt often show much creativity and/or admit new members correction: this story has been amended to reflect the correct spelling of geoffrey k pullums last name

Article - here’s why blizzard is already banning thousands of overwatch players it seems blizzard isn’t one to go back on its words last month it promised that it’ll ban any cheaters or hackers in overwatch, and there will be no second chances provided fast forward to now, only a few days after the game’s official launch, and it’s already coming good on its promise by banning thousands of overwatch players anyone using overwatch cheat programs are being banned by blizzard, and the company unleashed a massive ban wave yesterday that forced the program’s creators to actually shut down the servers until they figure out how to bypass blizzard’s security that’s not all, however a pc gamer report mentions that blizzard is banning cheaters not only once, but several times this means if you’ve cheated, buying a new copy might not be enough several users are reporting that blizzard banned them again after they bought a new copy a few even tried buying a 3rd copy and yet they got banned within 24 hours of playing the game blizzard’s even taken a more brutal stance in china the company, along with its partner netease, has ensured it bans anyone stupid enough to try cheating in the game it unleashed a massive 1572 person ban wave earlier today the company went a step ahead as far as savagery is concerned and revealed all the names it had banned due to cheating the moral of this story is clear as day, and it’s that you should not even think about cheating while playing overwatch no matter how smart you think you are, it’ll only end in one result, and that’s getting banned not once, but possibly forever and no, using a vpn might not be enough since many users have reported that blizzard managed to ban them even though they used a vpn the only solution: play fair and do not cheat simple?

Article - meditating inside a beautiful stock-photo room filled with plants is just one health benefit not available to poor people photo via getty reports on the income inequality gap and the separate lives of the wealthy and the poor have become depressingly rote the rich are not like you or me: they can buy their way into exclusive clubs, special social networks, even elitist sex parties the poorest people in america are now on average not making enough to meet their basic needs—that sounds pretty bad, but can i interest you in a $700 juicer? in that context, the publication, in the journal of the american medical association (jama), of a new study that looks at income and life expectancy after age 40 contains no bombshells the report, covered widely by the new york times and pretty much every other outlet on monday, drills down into how income and longevity correlate the richest 1 percent of men lives, on average, 15 years longer than the poorest 1 percent; for women that gap is ten years but the ability of money and the things it buys—access to better medical care, leisure time, healthier food—to stave off death is well known the big finding from stanford economist raj chetty and his seven co-authors is not that rich people live longer, its that the life expectancies of americans in poverty varies wildly depending on where they live heres how the times summarizes it: the poor in some cities—big ones like new york and los angeles, and also quite a few smaller ones like birmingham, ala—live nearly as long as their middle-class neighbors or have seen rising life expectancy in the 21st century but in some other parts of the country, adults with the lowest incomes die on average as young as people in much poorer nations like rwanda, and their life spans are getting shorter for the wealthy, it doesnt matter where they live—they seem to have the access to the same sorts of advantages wherever they go it is as if the top income percentiles belong to one world of elite, wealthy us adults, wrote nobel prize–winning economist angus deaton in an article that accompanied the study in jama, whereas the bottom income percentiles each belong to separate worlds of poverty, each unhappy and unhealthy in its own way the obvious question, then, is what makes those individual islands of scarcity more or less healthy than other communities? thats beyond the scope of the paper, but its clear that the answer isnt simply that some places have fewer or worse doctors the jama paper found that several measures of access to medical care had no clear relationship with longevity among the poor, noted the times but there were correlations with smoking, exercise, and obesity the places where the poor lived the longest include new york and san francisco—rich cities that can afford to provide a lot of services and have proactive public health departments san francisco was a pioneer in smoking bans; new york abolished trans fats poor people in and around birmingham had a surprisingly high life expectancy, but there too there has been an investment in health services, according to the times, and banned smoking in restaurants and other places in 2012 any study like this comes with some caveats one reason poor people in major metropolises have longer life expectancies could be that they have higher proportions of immigrants, who tend to live longer than native-born americans some people have lower incomes because their poor health damaged their earnings power, not the other way round and the authors adjusted the statistics for race and ethnicity in order to correct for racial differences in life expectancy (for instance, black people generally live less long than whites), something theyve been criticized for social marginalization is not reducible to single variables, wrote steven woolf and jason purnell in a jama editorial race/ethnicity is inseparable from the economic consequences and stress associated with segregation, past and present marginalization in the distribution of resources, structural racism, persistent poverty, and violence but if we accept the broader findings here, there seems to be almost a trickle-down affect when it comes to long life and health in poverty-pocked areas in the midwest and the south, poor people die sooner; in other words, in places that lack the services and infrastructure that wealthy big cities usually provide, people are less healthy health is about more than healthcare, woolf and purnell wrote good schools, crime-free neighborhoods, childhoods spared the trauma of family dysfunction, and other factors all contribute to whether someone is happy and healthy as an adult, or whether theyre trapped in that old cycle of poverty begetting stress begetting illness begetting more poverty seen from this angle, inequality looks like not just a matter of unfair numbers but a public health problem new yorks example suggests at least the bones of a solution: higher taxes to fund a local government that develops policies to discourage people from eating crappy food and smoking in many ways, this is a punishingly unfair city, but when it comes to having a healthy populace, it seems like other places could benefit from some new york values

Article - cured egg yolks are delicious—but strong because theyre super salty, theyre better used as condiment than as the main event for an umami boost, try grating them just like cheese over pasta, salads, avocado toast, popcorn, or even scrambled eggs currently, cured yolks arent even available in the most upscale grocery stores, so youll have to make your own even better if youre raising chickens at home and have your own fresh eggs on hand fortunately, the process couldnt be easier heres how: 1 start by combining 1 cup salt and 1 cup sugar in a bowl mix well to combine place half the mixture in a small baking dish 2 separate 4 egg yolks, saving the whites for another use carefully place each egg yolk on top of the salt-sugar mixture, and gently sprinkle the yolks with the rest of the salt-sugar mixture (this photo shows the eggs before they were completely covered you want them to be totally submerged in the salt-sugar mixture) cover the baking dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for 4 days 3 remove the egg yolks from the fridge after 4 days use a pastry brush to gently brush the salt-sugar mixture off of the egg yolks run the yolks under cold water to wash any of the remaining salt-sugar mixture off 4 place the yolks on a paper towel to drain and pat off any excess water transfer the yolks to a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake them at 150 degrees for 2 hours 5 at this point, the eggs yolks should be semi-firm and look sort of like dried apricots use them right away, or store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator up to 2 weeks *in case you missed the memo, egg yolks are totally good for you theyre packed with protein, vitamin d, and omega-3s and even though egg yolks are high in cholesterol, for most people, consuming dietary cholesterol doesnt increase your blood cholesterol

Article - many expected the appointment of jose mourinho to pump the brakes on any talk of david de gea heading to real madrid this summer but, alas, last summers annoyingly long transfer saga started up again this week with rumours that the recent champions league winners were set to renew their interest in the spanish stopper de gea to the bernabeu is a transfer rumour that seems destined to live in the gossip pages for eternity but the 25-year-old has given the most definitive statement yet on his intention to remain a manchester united player as de gea slammed the media for discussing the move without any genuine knowledge of whats going on people talk a lot and they know little, de gea said in quotes appearing in marca i know how all this works, but what i think is disrespectful is when people start making out that its something i have said ive got three more years on my contract with united and the desire to win more titles here de gea carried on to express his excitement with the arrival of mourinho and believes that the former chelsea boss brings with him a winners mentality, something that is badly required around old trafford if united are to start challenging for premier league titles again talk about jose mourinho and youre talking about a winner, de gea continued winning is uniteds, joses and my philosophy we can make a great team and i welcome him

Article - saudi arabia holds roughly $117 billion of the us government’s debt, according to treasury department data that disclosed the country’s holdings for the first time in over 40 years the kingdom’s holdings of american treasury bills have previously been grouped in with the 14 nations that comprise the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec), like kuwait and venezuela together, those countries own about $281 billion in us debt, down from $2984 billion in january a freedom of information act request filed by a freedom of information act request filed by bloomberg news led to the treasury department breaking down the assets by country the us started releasing data on foreign ownership of treasuries in 1974, but had never specified how much saudi arabia holds the $1168 billion saudi arabia owns puts it in the top 12 foreign nations with holdings of us debt, falling between india and singapore its total pales in comparison to china’s whopping $13 trillion and japan’s $11 trillion saudi holdings of treasuries peaked at $1236 billion in january, the data released monday show the numbers were made public as part of the treasury’s regular monthly reports the disclosure comes during an unusually tense time in us-saudi relations last month saudi officials warned the country would sell off $750 billion worth of treasuries and other assets in the states if congress approved a bill that would allow the monarchy to be sued in american courts for any role in the sept 11, 2001, terror attacks officials in washington and riyadh were already on edge because president obama is said to be seriously considering declassifying 28 pages of a congressional report into the 2001 attacks that some say indicate the hijackers, 15 of whom were saudi arabian, received support, explicit or otherwise, from the country’s vast royal family intelligence officials have been reviewing whether to make the pages public since 2014 and are due to deliver a recommendation to the president whatever the recommendation, the white house has said obama could ultimately use his executive authority to make the pages public the treasury department’s disclosure answers one of the questions surrounding the relationship between the two countries and shows that the monarchy, while an important player in the us financial system, doesn’t have as much leverage as many likely believed

insurmountable 134,000 vote lead – 14 percentage points -- leaving democrats crushed and trump’s team elated with a win that, at one point, they felt wouldn’t come story continued below i am so proud of this team! maga!, susie wiles, trump’s florida campaign manager, said in a text message using the acronym for his make america great again slogan her tone was a 180-degree turn from early in the evening when she called the day tense and nerve wracking despite hillary clinton’s large margins in miami-dade county and broward county, trump ran up the score elsewhere in the state -- from the deep south panhandle to the interior of florida to peninsula’s southwest, a bastion of working-class whites and retirees from the midwest who pushed him over the top trump ran up huge margins with white florida voters -- who comprise 64 percent of the state’s voting rolls -- and have always been the most reliable voters in terms of turnout latino turnout in miami-dade and orange county was just not enough for clinton the ups and downs of the campaign had gnawed at wiles for weeks when she took over following a campaign shake-up that left her in charge of winning must-win florida without much of a budget to advertise or turn out republican voters who tend to disproportionately cast absentee ballots by mail in early october, as hurricane matthew left part of the state damaged, wiles realized the campaign had mistakenly not run an absentee ballot program at all she sounded the alarm and trump made sure the money was reprogrammed two weeks ago during a meeting at trump’s golf club in doral, sources said, wiles successfully made the case to trump to spend more on mail, advertising and paid callers to reach out to more republican absentee ballot voters wiles, who managed gov rick scott’s first campaign, in 2010, would neither confirm nor deny the accounts the spending was noteworthy because trump, notoriously tight-fisted with campaign money, believed that campaigns dropped too much money on tv and get-out-the-vote ground game efforts instead, trump had his outsized personality, his knowledge of florida – his second home where he owns the palm beach mar-a-lago estate – and his plane that could carry him to any spot on a moment’s notice in florida, where thousands of supporters materialized for his rallies seemingly spontaneously but even with all of the new trump spending, hillary clinton’s campaign began to surge black and hispanic voters cast record numbers of absentee ballots and flocked to the early voting polls by tuesday morning, democrats felt confident they could ride out the wave of what they knew would be a surge of republican voters who tend to vote in greater force on election day about 1 pm, one source with clinton’s campaign said, the democrats were worried republicans were crushing the vote in the panhandle, southwest florida and smaller conservative-leaning counties by 5 pm, our voters showed again, the source, not authorized to speak by the campaign, said we felt pretty good the size of the vote was historic in populous democratic strongholds like broward, miami-dade and palm beach counties but turnout was even higher in republican areas by the end of the night, trump’s lead was so big that, even if turnout in florida was modeled at 80 percent – far higher than recent elections – clinton would still not win if she beat trump by double digits clinton’s campaign was almost reduced to a regional effort confined to the southeastern peninsula she won a stunning 571,000 more votes than trump in the miami-fort lauderdale media market, one of ten in the state, according to state elections data posted after midnight she won three lesser markets: west palm (a 44,000-vote lead); gainesville (10,000 more votes) and tallahassee (11,000 more votes) trump blew away records in the tampa bay media market, the western edge of the vaunted i-4 corridor that helps swing elections in the counties composing the market, trump rolled up a 193,000 vote lead over clinton in the jacksonville market in the northeast, he pulled in 165,000 more votes he held vote leads of 144,000 in naples-fort myers market, 126,000 in the pensacola market, 83,000 in the panama city market and 58,000 in the orlando market, which anchors the eastern end of the i-4 corridor one of trump’s pollsters, tony fabrizio, said the results showed that clinton exceeded president obama’s margins in the florida markets he won in 2012 but obama only carried florida by less than a point the difference here is that trump did far better than mitt romney did in almost every county on election day, fabrizio said trump began election day down by at least 57,000 votes to clinton, according to results posted on the florida division of elections website just after the last florida polls closed at 7 pm central time but after that, as election day votes poured in, trump began building a margin that stretched to more than 100,000 by 8:30 pm by 9:10 pm, trump’s margin started to peak at just under 150,000 votes over clinton it started to trend down but not fast enough for the liking of democrats, who just two hours before were musing about how trump had lost florida and therefore the white house so goes florida, so goes the country, said florida’s senior senator, bill nelson look at the hispanics turning out often the hispanics are registered no party affiliation, but the young hispanics, they’ll be voting for hillary nelson and other democrats also expected clinton to pad her margin with african-american support but while clinton rolled up votes with non-white voters, white voters appeared to heavily trend toward trump and whites are still a majority of florida’s voter rolls, 64 percent by registration and they vote in even greater numbers their outsized support counteracted the votes of hispanics and blacks – 16 percent and 13 percent of the voter rolls, respectively trump’s strong showing calls into question those who believed his inflammatory comments about immigration reform would ultimately cost him florida trump’s positions put him at loggerheads with the spanish-language powerhouse network, univision, which has studios in the same city as his doral golf club my theory is that no one can make it to the wh without the latino vote it seems @realdonaldtrump has a different theory see you nov 8th, univision pundit jorge ramos wrote june 3 on twitter, repeating his oft-held maxim – proven wrong in this instance by trump – about the power of the hispanic vote florida is also a retiree mecca, with one of the oldest populations in the country and poll after poll showed that the older the voter, the more they liked trump most major surveys also showed trump losing the state – including exit polls on election day this was a data defying feat that captured a populist fervor we just couldn’t measure, said one republican pollster who was surprised by trump’s numbers the trump campaign kept talking about the missing white voter well, they showed up on election day in myriad ways, trump succeeded despite the conventional wisdom trump’s campaign initially didn’t run a robust absentee-ballot program to get voters to fill out and mail back their votes he delayed advertising on television – a must for any other statewide candidate and he refused at times to soften his tone on immigration trump didn’t run a robust program in south florida targeting the hispanic community you could make an argument that his past statements [about immigration and illegal immigrants] made it impossible, said curt anderson, top adviser to gov scott, the chair of the pro-trump super pac but when gov scott won, he did so because he really reached out if trump had, we wouldn’t be talking right now he would have florida in the bag maybe he’ll win because of what’s in the countryside, so to speak, or the panhandle but this is really doing it the hard way the florida meltdown is a familiar story for democrats still scarred by al gore’s 2000 loss to george w bush in a razor close race though obama won the state twice, both times were by narrow margins built on the strength of his appeal to minority voters in the state but the vaunted obama machine in florida was no machine without obama on the ticket now democrats face a bleak prospect of the coming midterm elections, when liberal-leaning voters tend to stay away from the polls while republicans keep voting sen nelson’s team fears a showdown with scott, who has won twice based on the strength of white voters and an outsider message clinton allies expressed increasing optimism about their chances in the state heading into election day, energized by early vote results that showed hispanic turnout exploding exit polls reinforced that optimism, showing clinton with a narrow lead and demographic trends pointing her way trump’s strength was no surprise to republican party of florida chairman blaise ingoglia, who earlier in the day said republicans had more energized voters who couldn’t wait until election day to cast ballots we had the advantage in high-propensity voters and they didn’t, ingoglia said but ultimately, this is a message to the establishment it’s an anti-establishment year

Article_Title - 22 countries where the gender gap is smaller than in the us
Article - in a year that has brought us national conversations about working women, leaning in and whether or not the patriarchy is in fact dead, you might expect that all this talk signaled a real improvement for gender equality in the united states according to the 2013 global gender gap report released on oct 24 by the world economic forum, that, unfortunately, is not the case in fact, there are 22 countries where women have far more parity with their male counterparts than women do in the us the global gender gap report ranks 136 countries (which collectively contain over 93 percent of the worlds population) based on 14 indicators used to measure the size of a nations gender gap in four key areas: 1 economic participation and opportunity, which includes female labor force participation, wage equality and the percentage of women in high-ranking, highly-skilled jobs 2 educational attainment, which looks at female literacy, and womens access to and enrollment in both basic and higher education 3 political empowerment, which examines the number of women holding political office as well as the number of female heads of state over the last 50 years 4 health and survival, which is measured by comparing female and male life expectancy and mortality rates each country out of the 136 is assigned a score between 1 (total equality) and 0 (total inequality) for each of the 14 indicators the scores are then averaged to determine the overall rankings according to the reports authors, the index scores represent the percentage of the gap that has been closed between women and men this year the united states ranked 23rd and received a score of 07392, nearly the same as in 2012 when the us ranked 22nd with a score of 7373 unfortunately, our ranking and score have both decreased since 2011 that year, the us was ranked 17th, just behind the united kingdom and just ahead of canada, with a score of 7412 where the us really seems to falter is not in educational attainment -- we have near-perfect gender equality when it comes to enrollment in primary, secondary and tertiary educational institutions and though we ranked an abysmal 67th when it came to closing the wage gap, overall the us ranked 6th for economic participation but the us has a serious gender issue when it comes to politics, receiving a score of 159 for overall political empowerment, mostly because we have so few women in legislative and ministerial positions for example, women make up just 183 percent of the 113th congress and of course, this report does not account for everything that makes up the quality of a womans life for example, it is illegal in both nicaragua and the philippines for women to terminate a pregnancy as always, these rankings show us the places where we have made incredible progress when it comes to gender parity in the us -- and the areas where there is still much more work to be done here are 22 countries that are more gender equal

Article - l ast year, ast year, tesco’s food waste mountain amounted to 59,400 tonnes  if you’re finding that figure hard to envisage, it’s the equivalent of 119m meals, and an increase of 4% on the year before from this we can deduce that tesco’s voluble commitment to reducing its edible detritus has yet to yield results but is tesco any worse in this respect than any other supermarket chain? probably wisely, the others don’t publish their waste figures, but let’s just assume that if they had a better story to tell us, we’d already know all about it tesco’s waste tally is certainly grotesque, but pr executives expert in techniques for smoothing over corporate difficulties would doubtless applaud the masterly way tesco deflected criticism on the day that his chain’s depressing results were published, chief executive dave lewis addressed a food industry summit where he exhorted food manufacturers to do more to reduce their waste across the supply chain after deftly passing the waste ball back to his supply base, lewis reprised a favourite supermarket refrain: blame the consumer while the majority of food waste arises from the home, industry recognises the need to lead by example there you have the dramatis personae in tesco’s food waste script: profligate consumers, suppliers who earn a must work harder rating, and enlightened tesco, leading the vanguard in the national war on waste just in case you aren’t finding the plot line 100% credible, a further emotional strand is woven in: tesco promises to redistribute all its unsold edible food to charities from 2017 putting a gloss on your waste problem by repackaging it as a food poverty solution is a tactic increasingly deployed by our major supermarkets ideally, from a supermarket pr point of view, the term food poverty would appear in every headline that contains supermarket food waste, for that allows our giant retailers to bask in the role of philanthropists who use their corporate might for the common good it places a halo of saintliness around all their business activities but a waste prevention strategy should never be confused with a poverty reduction strategy crumbs from the rich man’s table is a shallow, and too easily self-aggrandising response to the unacceptable reality that millions of fellow citizens can’t afford to eat good, fresh food what’s more, the red herring of food poverty draws attention further away from one essential fact about supermarkets we must digest if we are ever to make any progress: waste is hard-wired into the supermarket system when the supermarkets began colonising the uk grocery market in the early 1980s, they appeared to be a newer, more efficient way of feeding the nation they promised vast economies of scale by virtue of their collective buying power and state-of-the-art distribution logistics that would bring every agricultural product on the planet to our shelves, 365 days a year this precision shopping model, we were assured, would produce dividends for consumers in the form of lower prices and more convenient shopping who needs parades of small, independent shops when chains can feed us so much more efficiently, and for less? once we sniffed the milk and pared mould off cheese; now we live in dread of food poisoning four decades on, it’s becoming obvious that supermarkets are incapable of delivering this promise why? they are retail dinosaurs, locked into a system that’s riddled with problems one such glaring issue is food waste far from discouraging it, the supermarket business model actively begets it there aren’t, to my knowledge, any robust statistics on levels of food waste in british households before the supermarket era, but i’d hazard a guess that they were much lower than they are now our rubbish bins really started filling up when, instead of shopping for a little, as was needed, every day or two, we were persuaded to adopt the one-stop supermarket shopping trip theoretically, armed with a list, we could buy all the food we needed for a week nowadays, supermarket online ordering makes that even easier to do just press the same-as-last-week option so supermarkets egg us on to overlook what we already have and to buy much more than we need they encourage us to hazard a weekly guess about what we’ll consume, rather than focusing on what’s in our fridges and larders day-to-day if the untouched remnants of last week’s order are stacking up in the fridge when the supermarket van arrives at our door, most people will consign them to the bin, schooled to believe, thanks to supermarket use by and best before dates, that judging freshness is best left to distant experts once we sniffed the milk and pared mould off cheese, now we live in dread of poisoning better safe than sorry, surely? but sell-by dates – the progenitor of use by and best before – were introduced by supermarkets as stock rotation tools, to help clunky, mammoth chains keep tabs on the unprecedented amount of product passing through their system, not primarily as safeguards against food poisoning undoubtedly, certain foods sold by supermarkets do pose a very real risk to health around two thirds of their raw chickens are contaminated with potentially lethal campylobacter at the point of sale, even though they are well within their use-by dates yet again supermarkets point the finger of blame at the stupid, sloppy home cook who fails to slay the bacteria through thorough cooking, rather than eradicating infection at their factory farms and don’t forget that supermarkets have actively undermined our national food handling experience and skill by telling us that we’re too time poor to cook from scratch, largely because it is much more profitable for them to sell us value-added, processed foods whose apparent freshness is validated by reassuring dates the bottom line here is that such dates are absolutely no guarantee that food is truly fresh or safe, yet they shape our daily decisions about what we eat and what we bin battalions of quangos, non-governmental organisations, government agencies and charities see supermarkets as allies in the war on food waste, but in reality, they are a huge part of the problem if we are to stop waste at source, we must look to and learn from the burgeoning grassroots initiatives that aim to relocalise and scale down our food chain

Article - college affordability has recently become the preeminent issue in higher education, as student-debt figures have hit staggering levels but most conversations center on ballooning tuition costs, rather than a less well-known expense that strains the wallets of college students: textbooks since 1977, the price of college textbooks has more than tripled the rate of inflation, meaning a 1,041% rise, according to nbc news, which cites bureau of labor statistics data theyve been able to keep raising prices because students are captive consumers they have to buy whatever books theyre assigned, nicole allen, a spokeswoman for the scholarly publishing and academic resources coalition, told nbc some publishers contest the idea that textbook prices have risen exorbitantly, claiming that what may look like stark increases in percentages actually represent more modest increases in whole dollars still, students and experts following the trend say that the prices are becoming prohibitively expensive and the high prices are beginning to discourage some students from purchasing textbooks for their classes, despite the fact that they realize it may hurt their grades the us public interest research group (us pirg) conducted a survey of 156 different college campuses across 33 states and found that 65% of students decided against buying a book required for class due to its high cost and 94% of those students acknowledged that they were afraid that the move would hurt their grade the textbooks market is broken and students are paying the price, ethan senack, a higher-education associate at us pirg, told us news & world report in 2014 [students] cant shop around and find the most affordable option, meaning theres no consumer control on the market, senack said they can, however, mitigate the rising cost of textbooks by looking for alternatives, such as buying used books and selling their books after the course has come to an end

Article - an expert on lou gehrigs disease explains what we know about this debilitating condition and how hawking has beaten the odds editor’s note: renowned theoretical physicist stephen hawking died on march 14, 2018, at age 76 this story, originally published on his 70th birthday on january 7, 2012, is being resurfaced to explain how he beat the odds and lived so long with the disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) stephen hawking turns 70 on sunday, beating the odds of a daunting diagnosis by nearly half a century the famous theoretical physicist has helped to bring his ideas about black holes and quantum gravity to a broad public audience for much of his time in the public eye, though, he has been confined to a wheelchair by a form of the motor-neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) and since 1985 he has had to speak through his trademark computer system—which he operates with his cheek—and have around-the-clock care but his disease seems hardly to have slowed him down hawking spent 30 years as a full professor of mathematics at the university of cambridge and he is currently the director of research at the schools center for theoretical cosmology but like his mind, hawkings illness seems to be singular most patients with als—also known as lou gehrigs disease, for the famous baseball player who succumbed to the disease—are diagnosed after the age of 50 and die within five years of their diagnosis hawkings condition was first diagnosed when he was 21, and he was not expected to see his 25th birthday why has hawking lived so long with this malady when so many other people die so soon after diagnosis? we spoke with leo mccluskey, an associate professor of neurology and medical director of the als center at the university of pennsylvania, to find out more about the disease and why it has spared hawking and his amazing brain what is als—and is there more than one form of it? als, which is also known as a motor-neuron disease—and colloquially as lou gehrigs disease in the us—is a neurodegenerative disease each muscle is controlled by motor neurons that reside in the brain in the frontal lobe these are controlled electrically and are synaptically connected to motor neurons that reside lower down in the brain—as well as motor neurons that reside in the spinal cord the guys in the brain are called the upper motor neurons, and the guys in the spine are called the lower motor neurons the disease causes weakness of either upper motor neurons or lower motor neurons or both its been known for quite some time that there are variants of als one is referred to as progressive muscular atrophy, or pma it appears to be an isolated illness of the lower motor neurons however, pathologically, if you do an autopsy of a patient, they will have evidence of deterioration of upper motor neurons there is also primary lateral sclerosis—pls—and clinically it looks like an isolated upper motor-neuron disorder however, pathologically they also have lower motor-neuron disorder the other classic syndrome is called progressive baldor palsy—or progressive supranuclear palsy—which is weakening of cranial muscles, like the tongue, face and swallowing muscles but it pretty much always spreads to limb muscles those are the four classic motor-neuron disorders that have been described and it was thought for quite some time that these disorders were limited to motor neurons its now clear that thats not true its now well recognized that 10 percent of these patients can develop degeneration in another part of the brain, such as other parts of the frontal lobe that dont contain the motor neurons or the temporal lobe so some of these patients can actually develop dementia, called frontal-temporal lobe dementia one of the misconceptions about als is that its only a motor-neuron disease, and thats not true what has stephen hawkings case shown about the disease? one thing that is highlighted by this mans course is that this is an incredibly variable disorder in many ways on average people live two to three years after diagnosis but that means that half the people live longer, and there are people who live for a long, long time life expectancy turns on two things: the motor neurons running the diaphragm—the breathing muscles so the common way people die is of respiratory failure and the other thing is the deterioration of swallowing muscles, and that can lead to malnutrition and dehydration if you dont have these two things, you could potentially live for a long time—even though youre getting worse whats happened to him is just astounding hes certainly an outlier has he lived so long because he got the disease when he was young and had the juvenile-onset type? juvenile-onset is diagnosed in the teenage years, and i dont know enough about his course to say but its probably something similar to juvenile-onset disorder, which is something that progresses very, very, very slowly i have patients in my clinic who were diagnosed in their teens and are still alive in their 40s, 50s or 60s but not having ever examined him or taken a history, its a little hard for me to say hes a very good example of the sparing of the non-motor parts of the brain that can occur how frequent are these cases of very slow-progressing forms of als? i would say probably less than a few percent how much do you think stephen hawkings longevity has been due to the excellent care that he has received versus the biology of his particular form of als? its probably a little bit of both i just know him from television, so i dont know what kind of interventions hes had if he really isnt on a ventilator, then its his biology—its the biology of his form of the neurodegenerative disease that determines how long he will live for trouble swallowing you can elect to have a feeding tube placed, which basically takes malnutrition and dehydration off the table but mostly its about the biology of the disease hawking obviously has quite the active mind, and previous statements that he has made seem to indicate he has a pretty positive mental outlook, despite his condition is there any evidence that lifestyle and psychological well-being do much to help with patients outcomes? or is the disease usually too quick for that to make a difference? i dont believe that adds to longevity als still doesnt have a cure what have we learned about the disease recently that might help us find one—or at least better treatments? beginning in 2006 it became clear that like a lot of other neurodegenerative diseases, als was determined by the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the brain ten percent of als is genetic and based on a gene mutation im sure there are also at-risk genes for als, but there are now multiple genes that have been identified as potentially causing the disease each one of them are interesting in that they lead to the accumulation of different proteins in the brain knowing specific genes gives us particular mechanisms in the brain, and would potentially give us targets for therapies but none of this has given us any robust therapies yet what does stephen hawkings case mean for people who have the disease? its just an incredible, incredible example of the variability of the disease—and the hope for patients who have it that they could also live a long life unfortunately, its a small percentage of people for whom that actually happens

Article_Title - this new shade of blue was accidentally discovered by chemists
Article - back in 2009, a lab full of chemists stumbled across a new pigment, more or less by sheer chance after being heralded as the creation of a near-perfect blue pigment, this coincidental eureka moment is now being manufactured for artists’ brushes this burst of blue came about when scientists at oregon state university (osu) heated manganese oxide, along with other chemicals, to over 1,200°c (2,000°f) although the scientists were actually looking at manganese oxide for some of its electronic properties, one of their reactions inadvertently birthed a new pigment: the catchily named yinmn blue the findings of the original study were published in the journal of the american chemical society basically, this was an accidental discovery, said mas subramanian, a milton harris professor of materials science in the osu department of chemistry, in a statement our work had nothing to do with looking for a pigment he added: then one day a graduate student who is working on the project was taking samples out of a very hot furnace while i was walking by, and it was blue, a very beautiful blue i realized immediately that something amazing had happened so, what’s so special about this blue? this pigment is far more stable when exposed to heat or acidic conditions additionally, unlike prussian blue or cobalt blue pigments, it doesn’t release cyanide and is not carcinogenic – thats always a plus not only that, the highly reflective properties of the new pigment means it could be used in paints that could help keep buildings cool by reflecting infrared light subramanian told artnet in a recent interview that the pigment has become a popular choice among artists because of its vivid color and resistant properties the paint manufacturers shepherd color company have also licensed a patent and is now selling samples of yinmn blue he added: our pigment is useful for art restoration, because it is similar to ultramarine but really more durable [h/t: mental floss]

Article_Title - blocking blue light helps sleep
Article - the disruptive effects of artificial light on sleep are well documented, and have received an increasing amount of attention in recent years -- with good reason nighttime exposure to artificial light -- which for the great majority of us happens without much thought or awareness -- disrupts the bodys circadian rhythm, altering the 24-hour biological clock that controls our sleep-wake cycle in addition to wreaking havoc with sleep, disruptions to circadian rhythms also have been associated with a number of serious diseases, including cancer, diabetes, depression and heart disease in particular, research in recent years has shown that blue wavelength light is especially harmful to circadian rhythm function studies have shown that blue wavelength light has uniquely harmful effects on humans and suppresses melatonin levels more vigorously than other light wavelengths unfortunately, many energy-efficient light sources produce high concentrations of blue light blue light is emitted by electronic devices, energy-efficient light bulbs, and other common light sources research investigating blue-light blocking -- most often in the form of goggles that filter out this particular wavelength of light -- has shown promise a new study of cataract patients indicates that artificial lens implants can help improve sleep scientists at chinas sichuan university studied the effects of blue-light blocking artificial lenses implanted during cataract surgery the study involved 40 patients who required surgery for cataracts in both eyes cataract surgery commonly involves removal of the eyes damaged lens and insertion of an artificial lens cataracts are a common condition among older adults -- approximately 60 percent of people over the age of 60 experience cataracts the study subjects -- 26 women and 14 men, with an average age of 74 -- were given artificial lenses with blue-light blocking capability researchers assessed patients sleep quality before surgery and again two months after surgery they found patients sleep had improved significantly across several measures: patients were sleeping more during the night their sleep quality had improved their levels of daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness had diminished the number of subjects who met the criteria for poor sleepers had decreased lens replacement surgery is necessary for cataract patients but there are other, less-invasive ways to filter out blue-light that are also being investigated by sleep scientists research has shown the benefits to sleep of manipulating and controlling exposure to blue light: a study of 20 adults who wore either blue-light blocking or ultraviolet-light blocking glasses for three hours before sleep found that both sleep quality and mood improved among those in the group who wore blue-light blocking glasses, compared to the ultraviolet-light blocking group shift workers are at especially high risk for circadian rhythm disruptions because of their non-traditional schedules in a study by scientists at quebecs universite laval, nightshift workers used blue-light blocking glasses at or near the end of their overnight shifts for four weeks at the end of study period, their overall sleep amounts increased, as did their sleep efficiency while nighttime exposure to blue wavelength light is damaging to circadian rhythms, exposure to blue light isnt always detrimental daytime exposure to blue light can stimulate alertness and help sleep later on a study of 94 office workers found that daytime exposure to blue light during work hours resulted in improvements both to sleep and to daytime functioning, compared to exposure to white light subjects who were exposed to blue light experienced improvements to daytime alertness, mood, and concentration these subjects also experienced decreases in daytime sleepiness and they slept better at night this area of research is critically important, and i expect we will see a great deal more investigation into the effects of blue wavelength light on sleep and health but you dont need special goggles or eye lens implants to protect your circadian rhythms and your sleep from the negative effects of artificial light here are some low-tech suggestions that can help you: limit exposure to artificial light in the hours before bed the last 1-2 hours before bed should be a time of winding down and preparing for sleep decreasing your exposure to light is an important part of this process you dont have to sit in a pitch-black room, but you should think about beginning to limit your exposure to bright lights, whether from your computer screen or your television reading under moderate lamplight is fine if youre using a tablet to read, bring the screens brightness level down make the last 60 minutes of your bedtime ritual electronics-free -- and keep electronic gadgets and devices out of the bedroom altogether get light exposure during the day daytime exposure to light -- both sunlight and artificial light -- can help strengthen circadian rhythms and boost daytime alertness, leaving you better prepared to sleep when the time comes if you need access to light in the middle of the night, use small nightlights rather than switching on hallway or bathroom lights -- and flooding your system with melatonin-suppressing light -- use low-illumination night lights to guide you when you need to get up in the dark being aware of the effects of nighttime exposure to light and making some basic changes to bedtime routines can go a long way toward getting you the darkness you need to sleep well, even in this ever-bright modern age

Article - forget whether or not there is water on mars - if this photo is to be believed, there is fresh beer on the red planets surface an eagle-eyed mars anomaly hunter has spotted a strange object that looks like a green bottle in nasa rover imagery the bizarre bottle shape appears to have a red, green and white label and even a cork or cap at the end scroll down for video  pareidolia is the psychological response to seeing faces and other significant and everyday items in random stimulus it is a form of apophenia, when people see patterns in random, unconnected data there have been multiple occasions when people have claimed to see religious images and themes in unexpected places on the red planet, one of the most famous is the face on mars spotted by one of the viking orbiters in 1976 this was later proven to just be a chance alignment of shifting sand dunes   the pictures were taken by nasas spirit rover during a mission on the surface of mars in november 2007 vigilante mars anomaly hunter thomas miller, 64, spotted the strange shape while he was sifting through curiositys latest snaps of the red planet this find is exceptionally clear; the design of the bottle is a bit different but recognisable, mr miller, a canadian musician, told mailonline of course theres no way to know for sure its a beer bottle, im going out on limb calling it that if someday we visit their planet it would be nice to think we could sit down and have a beer with them the anomaly hunter found the bottle while browsing through panoramas of nasa images stitched together by other mars enthusiasts i think it is evidence of current habitation on mars, he told mailonline we find trash, tools, machine parts, bits of paper, as well as sculpture and carved stone tablets i tend to see artifacts on the martian surface as part art gallery and part garbage dump but nigel watson, an alien expert and author of the ufo investigations manual, is sceptical of the bottle find i think they are looking for anything out of the ordinary, and our minds like to see patterns in things given the thousands of images of mars, you are bound to find something that looks a bit unusual, he told mailonline usually clearer pictures or those taken from a different angle show that such anomalies are really rocks or tricks of the light  the strange bottle shape is not the first oddity to be spotted on mars in december last year, nasas curiosity rover took footage that appeared to show a large spoon on the red planets surface it is the second spoon to be found on mars in recent years, with alien hunters claiming it could be proof of developed life on the planet other objects such as rings and gloves have also been found in recent years  the curiosity video was uploaded to youtube by ufo hunter account secure team with the description: there is a giant spoon on mars! this thing is amazing! probably left over from a lost civilisation and some users were amazed at the discovery - one said: wow, it couldnt possibly be natural, could it? however, others were more sceptical, suggesting it could be an optical illusion one user commented: we see what we want to see some folk see the face of jesus in tea-leaves, others see the man in the moon

Article - for travelers with the gleam of the big apple in their eye, nothing seems better than new york city in the summertime restaurants have outdoor seating, there are festivals all over town, and you dont have to worry about bringing your jacket to top of the rock but long-time city dwellers know the horror behind the mystique: those awful smells that dominate every daily commute to and from the office heres why its hard to escape the stench of the city in the heat of summer new york city has the highest population density in the us, and with 8,550,405 people roaming the nation’s melting pot, it’s bound to get smelly a census conducted in july 2015 showed that the city had a population density of over 27,000 people per square mile to put that into perspective, the us, on average, holds only 80 people per square mile that much combined body odor alone could be enough to scare anyone away with such an insanely huge number of people living in just one city, it should come as no surprise that there is also an insanely huge amount of garbage produced although residents of the city produce 12,000 tons of waste every day, new york city doesn’t have any of its own landfills or incinerators garbage piles up in dumpsters until it can all be taken across the hudson river to be incinerated in new jersey, or, if possible, recycled locally and overseas but even after most of this waste has been incinerated across the river, strong winds can still carry the stench back over to the city on a hot day the sheer amount of garbage isn’t the only problem there also has to be a way to get all of it out of the city diesel trucks carry garbage out of manhattan 78 million times each year let this sink in: that’s the same as driving around the earth 312 times, and thats just for one city all this driving only adds to pollution and the greenhouse effect, causing the city to become warmer and smellier as time continues you may also be wondering why those subway vents on every block smell so much more putrid on a steamy summer day or how it is possible to smell a food cart from all the way down the street it turns out the combination of heat and humidity allow bacteria to grow faster and smells to travel further increasing temps mean molecules move faster, resulting in enzymes speeding up metabolism and cells quickly increasing in size heat is bacteria’s best friend so when you get stuck with one those incredibly humid days, smells become only more potent the water in the air causes these odors to dissolve, trapping them longer than if it were a dry day outside to many, new york is the city of dreams, but you have to be willing to accept it for the good, the bad, and the smelly

Article - investigating strange cries emanating from a west virginia dumpster sounds like the start of a horror movie chances are, there would be nothing inside one of those that would make your day any better but james butler might disagree with you there james was strolling through coonskin park, a riverside sliver of nature located in kanawha county, west virginia, when he heard a strange noise coming from one of the dumpsters there curiosity piqued, he investigated, only to discover something that had him fumbling for his camera retired west virginia police officer and aviation enthusiast james butler heard strange cries coming from a charleston, west virginia, dumpster on tuesday, august 11, 2015 curious, he investigated the sounds right away, he noticed two things five raccoons were trapped inside the coonskin park trash receptacle, and one of those raccoons was like nothing hed ever seen before as to how they got stuck, james said, the dumpster had apparently been emptied and the garbage level was low and the raccoons couldn’t reach the top to get back out and that rare raccoon? he didnt really look like like his family members—or like any raccoon james had ever seen! this trashmonger was an albino raccoon, an incredibly rare specimen according to the indiana division of fish and wildlife how rare, exactly? the organization stated only one in 750,000 raccoons inherit the albino gene, a mutation that means the animal creates no melanin and therefore has no pigmentation stunned by his find, james didnt forget the real trouble at hand—these raccoons were stuck thinking quickly, james fabricated a little something to help the raccoons escape their trash pit prison: a wood plank he leaned it on the inside of the dumpster, and the raccoons could use it like a ramp! they were free—but that brought consequences the albino raccoon had been a well-kept secret in coonskin park, according to rodney jones, chief of kanawhas park police department and once james shared his pictures online, officer jones feared it would become the subject of the publics curious cameras now that the albino’s getting publicity, rodney said, i figure people will start looking to see if they can find it around the park and people searching for a wild animal—with a wild animals instincts—can be trouble we try to tell people with animals to keep their distance and don’t try to feed them, he said after emphasizing that raccoons carry deadly diseases id really hate to see an animal like that be destroyed because of someone’s curiosity or stupidity worse, the albino raccoons appearance can make it a prize in the eyes of some people something special that needs to be captured or owned such was the case with a four-year-old albino raccoon in georgia for part of her early life, isis the albino raccoon had a miserable existence because of her unique look, someone captured her and locked her in a small, wire cage, intending to use her for a taxidermy project luckily, there was good news in store for her the georgia department of natural resources rescued isis and delivered the raccoon to maxine rainey, below, director of the georgia animal sanctuary, a new hope but both the sanctuary and the department of natural resources feared she was a lost cause understandably, isis was aggressive human touch scared her, and she lashed out at anyone trying to help her since she was described as so aggressive, maxine said, we were just going to hold her for a couple of days but then what? when maxine accepted the albino raccoon, she gave the poor animal a look over: she had urine burns, smelled horrendous, was obese, losing hair, and had sores all over her feet no wonder she was aggressive maxine, though, had hope for the poor animal she sat in the enclosure with the animal that, by all accounts, shouldve been trying to tear her head off if she got too close but amazingly, that didnt happen id been going through some stuff in my personal life, maxine said, and i was kind of having a sad day, so isat by her and she came right up to meshe came up and sniffed me, and put her little hands in my hand from there, the raccoons life only got better shes so gentle, maxine said she spent the last couple days glued to my side, sleeping on my lap, having me carry her aroundi just saw a complete 180-degree flip in her personality the minute she was exposed to some kindness for a raccoon once deemed so aggressive she had to be kept away from other raccoons at the facility, thats a pretty glowing review! but the story of isis only underscored the worry of rodney jones, the chief of kanawha’s park police department people like james butler are often fascinated with animals that are different and unique, but its important to remember theyre wild animals—potentially dangerous and capable of love and affection theyre to be admired from afar! james had the right idea when he saw the albino raccoon: he took some photos, set him free from the dumpster, and let him go on his way hopefully others lucky enough to spot one of these beautiful beasts in nature take the same approach!

could you actually check everything off the buzzfeed bucket list, and if so, how long would it take? a little while ago, i set out to find out for myself heres how i did it: first, i had to compile all of the lists buzzfeed has published in its before you die format at the time i filed this story, there were 182 lists these ranged from appreciating the little things in life (like watching the sunset) to full-blown adventures (like going to south africas version of burning man) buzzfeed writers also seem obsessed with food, since practically every other list is about stuffing your face with 21 amazing aussie burgers or the ten best new orleans po-boys or the 15 best cheese toasties in london next, i cataloged each task on each of the 182 lists there are over a thousand individual tasks on motherboard: counting the hours ive spent on the internet next, i calculated the time it would take to complete each of the tasks this is where it all got slightly more complicated, since the time it would take to do most of these things is highly individualized eating fish and chips, for example—how long does that take the average person? if you were really vying for time, you could probably scarf some down in five minutes, but id much prefer to spend an hour savoring of a nice, greasy plate and what if the restaurant was really busy and it took a long time for your server to bring the fish and chips to you? i settled on 30 minutes for eating fish and chips, as well as the other food-related tasks other tasks required a fair amount of research, like hiking the camino de santiago, otherwise known as st james path, between spain and france, which is less like a path and more like a pilgrimage the trail is nearly 500 miles long according to the trails official website, it takes four to six weeks to complete i decided to allot 30 days to complete the trail, even though the website also noted that you would need to hike 18 miles per day without any rest days to finish the trail in that time, which seems completely insane i repeated this process for every single task on buzzfeeds lists again, there are over a thousand individual tasks here is a time table showing a small sample of the time i allotted for certain tasks: some of the lists contained fast, easy tasks that be completed entirely from your couch—like this one, which requires you to look at 20 pictures of miniature pigs before you die—but for most of them, you have to travel some of the lists, like the five highest places to visit before you die, require you to jet-set from the haiku stairs of oahu, hawaii to the petronas towers of kuala lumpur, malaysia, to the taihang mountains in china in order to accomplish all of the tasks most effectively, you would need to travel the world so i decided to calculate the travel time that it would take to work your way around the world, in an order most efficient for accomplishing each of the buzzfeed tasks i decided to begin my hypothetical bucket-list journey in boston, where i live, and work my way west through north america i would visit 36 states in the united states and stop in canada and mexico along the way then onto the dominican republic to explore the three shipwrecks of bayahibe, followed by stops at turks and caicos, and belize some stops later, id spend 175 hours and ten minutes flying from country to country in europe, stopping in estonia to see the beech tree in hiiumaa before taking a quick ten-minute flight over to finland to go to the kontula indoor skatepark in helsinki id make my way over to turkey to swim in the crystal blue mineral waters of the pamukkale springs in hierapolis and then pop over to jordan to grab a drink at the cave bar in petra i whittled the travel time down to one-hour flights over borders, stopping in some countries for only a few minutes to visit a bakery or for a few hours to watch a sports game in total, the round-the-world trip would take 26 days in travel time alone, and would include 108 countries the last thing i calculated was sleep time i figured a person would be fairly tired after spending months on end climbing mountains, reading plays, and visiting museums every day, so i allotted the doctor-recommended eight hours per night i really enjoy sleeping, so this is painful for me to even imagine, but when youre racing to finish an extensive bucket-list in the fastest amount possible, i suppose luxuriating in the rem cycle shouldnt be a priority i also factored in how long it took me to calculate the trip—around 40 hours in total—and how long it would take to actually book the flights, hotels, and day-trips, which would be possibly twice that in conclusion—drumroll, please—i determined it would take 1,4487 days to do everything that buzzfeed says you need to do before you die thats 207 weeks, or just shy of four years ill repeat that some of the timing calculations were arbitrary you could get stuck in a restaurant with poor service and it might take double the time to eat your fish and chips, or you could arrive somewhere like the trinity church on king george island in antarctica and decide it was too boring to stay the full hour your flights could get delayed, or you could get food poisoning at one of the restaurants and choose to bail on the next days activities if you got the timing wrong, you might miss the small window when all 39 christmas markets on the list are open, or arrive at the mendenhall ice caves in juneau, alaska, to find that they have all melted but if you planned it just right and you had the time, money, and stamina to accomplish everything on the list, then you could definitely do it that said, im not sure why anyone would want to there are a lot of things on that list that i, personally, have no interest in doing why should i visit 39 different christmas markets across europe? i mean, im sure theyre beautiful and each have nice hot chocolate and giant, neon candy canes, but whats the harm in not seeing all 39 of them? is it really worth the hours it would take to learn all 44 of these air guitar songs? would i really be a lesser person for not having visited these 19 penis-shaped objects around the world? im not saying i wouldnt do it if someone offered me the chance to travel the world and see some of the coolest things this earth has to offer, id be hard pressed to say no of course, ill probably die before that happens buzzfeed has a handy quiz for that, too

Article_Title - russell wilson listens to gospel before kickoff
Article - russell wilson is just about one of the most humble people you could ever meet he’s like tim tebow, but wilson doesn’t look like he’s going back to baseball any time soon at age 27 there is definitely more to come for the seattle seahawks quarterback not only does he have two super bowl appearances and a championship to his name, but he just earned another ring after tying the knot with ciara with the seahawks in the middle of training camp and only three days away from their preseason opener against the chiefs, we had a chance to chat with wilson about a recent commercial he shot with bose for their quietcomfort35 headphones over the phone, the three-time pro bowler and super xlviii champion talked about his unusual—at least for your average nfl player’s standards—taste in music, the future of the seattle seahawks, and how married life is treating him so what is this bose commercial looking like? it’s gonna be a good commercial i’m not giving away too much, i want people to see it first kinda can’t tell too much, but it was a great commercial it’s so much fun shooting those commercials, especially with bose they’re very first class in everything they do, and i’m a big music person, as you know i listen to tons of music, and we always have music playing around the house, ciara and i, but also on the field, too i have the wireless headphones in the locker room and the training room, and we listen to music when we’re watching film, all those things, so i’m constantly just listening to music i think it can bring me a sense of peace and allows me to cancel out all the noise i just like focusing on the things i need to focus on you have one song to listen to before kickoff, what’re you listening to? that’s a great question i’m gonna be ready by yolanda adams  that’s probably my go-to song before a game, i’m always listening to gospel music i’m just so grateful on game day i don’t try to be all amped up i try to be calm as can be and just grateful that i can play the game it’s a special, special day, those days so you’re not listening to drake, eminem, or anyone like that before kickoff? nah, i’m chillin’ out the nfl said they’re going to teach referees to call questionable catches incomplete if they aren’t 100 percent sure you’ve been a part of questionable catches, how do you feel about what the nfl is trying to do? i think ultimately the nfl and all the players, we just want it to be called the right way, whatever that is that’s the simplicity of it it’s not that complicated i think the biggest thing is, the referees, they always want to make the right call, and us as players, we always want them to make the right call as well i think ultimately the nfl and all the players, we just want it to be called the right way, whatever that is that’s the simplicity of it it’s not that complicated i think the biggest thing is, the referees, they always want to make the right call, and us as players, we always want them to make the right call as well before a game, i’m always listening to gospel music i’m just so grateful on game day i don’t try to be all amped up in the last four years, you have faced a division rival in the playoffs what’s it like to face a team in the division in the postseason? our division, in my opinion, is one of the hardest divisions, for sure, the nfc west so many talented players, so many talented teams when you go against the 49ers twice a year, you go against the rams twice a year, you go against the arizona cardinals twice a year, that’s not an easy conference, but we try tothe ultimate goal for us is to go 1-0 every week and to block out all the noise and to focus on one game in a week that’s a big part of my philosophy, and our team philosophy is just to go 1-0 every week and just try to win that one game and see what happens you were ranked 17th in the nfl top 100 where would you rank yourself, and what do you have to do to be ranked higher next year? that’s not for me to worry about all i care about is our team winning; that’s the only thing that matters the rest will handle itself that’s my only focus, man all that stuff like i said, i just try to block out all that noise, ignore the noise, and like i said, winning a game, and a big part of that is kind of my regimen—how i get ready for the offseason, how i get ready for a game, and the focus you put into all the hard work that you put into everything you do, and bose definitely plays a part of that; my music plays a major part of that what did you make of the hall of fame game being canceled? i think it was the right decision in terms of players safety it always comes down to players’ safety there was the big blockbuster trade where you guys got jimmy graham last year you guys were ranked low in tight end receptions, and jimmy only had 48 catches in 11 games how come his numbers went down? unfortunately, he didn’t get to play the whole season kinda holds him back, but we always wanna get better, and we always wanna do more so we’re looking forward to him being back out there on the field he’s gonna do a great job how much did marshawn lynch mean to this team and your play? marshawn’s a great football player he’s always gonna be well respected across the league now, guys gotta step up, and we can’t wait we have a great team, we have a lot of great players i’m excited about the running back group that we have stepping in those guys are gonna do a great job, and we’re looking forward to having a great season are you concerned the legion of boom won’t last much longer with more free agency talks and contracts coming up for them? i think the legion of boom is going to be great once again i’m excited about all the things that they’re gonna do this year our team, just in general, our offense and defense and special teams—you take it one day at a time congratulations on the marriage, how is the married life? it’s a blessing man, to find someone so special, so sweet she’s one of the best people you can ever meet, one of the best moms you can ever meet i’m just grateful for that your celebrity has reached new heights from third-round pick out of college to a couple super bowl appearances as the quarterback of one of the best teams in the league—so what is the craziest headline you have ever heard about yourself? awh man, i don’t pay attention to any of that stuff i’m just grateful i get to play the game of football i’m just grateful i get to take the god-given ability that god has given me and just spread it across to my teammates and for us to play together and try to hopefully win another super bowl, and that’s kind of my singular focus so i’m just grateful, man i’m grateful that god has given me that opportunity

Article - so we started doing the school supply shopping this week a daunting task even as the kids get older and the lists get shorter gone in my house are the days when the most expensive item on the list was the ever-elusive just this size binder now, we’re talking calculators that rival my electricity bill but i sigh, watch the ads, and get out there and do it i put on my thickest armor because nothing will be just right for my kids the kitty folders are too childish; the more mature ones are $200 a piece add to that the hysterical mobs crowding the $1 pencils like they were the last chance to win tickets to a 21 pilots concert, and we have a joyfest that keeps on giving (insert sarcastic eye roll here) yes, i’m frustrated and let’s talk about that list, shall we? i mean, who in their right mind thinks it’s a good idea to request that our kids purchase expo markers in bulk or boxes of kleenex that should be supplied already? especially when those might not get used by my kids? who thinks it should be my job to bring ziploc bags to school? well, i’ll tell you who this mom i’m not going to buy just the one extra box of tissues because (let’s all be honest here) i can afford more than that and *gasp* what if someone other than my precious timmy uses them? well, then, haven’t i done a good deed for the year for less than the cost of a coffee? we should all be interested in what will create the best learning environment for all these kids, for all these little people who will be making big decisions some day like what to do with your social security or how to fix your city infrastructure or how best to treat that cancerous mass in your body if you don’t agree with something on the list and think it’s excessive, have a conversation with the teacher i guarantee if it is something that will actually get used to educate your children, the teacher will be able to explain how yes, expo markers are expensive get in a classroom and watch children solve problems at their desks (sometimes on them) with them and really engage in the process because it all of a sudden became colorful and perhaps a little bit taboo you think you have to buy too many glue sticks? i invite you to join a class when they do a simple sorting and gluing project that gives the kids one more opportunity to understand all the -augh words and their various pronunciations and watch multiple children go through half a stick just for that one project more is more, right? and yes, the theory is that you teach them to use less, but let’s be honest: some just use what they use watch kids clean the floor at the end of the day and, in a rush to get home, throw away all the trash they found, which includes half used pencils and crayons that would take too long to find a home for so, let’s fast forward to january the supplies are no longer new and shiny, and more than a few have met their untimely trash can demise used and broken crayons look better in that circular file than in pencil boxes glue sticks that still have some in them but are not the easiest to use just aren’t worth it anymore markers find new homes in backpacks pencils that have no erasers have lost their appeal dry erase markers are dried up because they have been used to solve, spell, create and then what happens? supplies that were an extra $10 from you at the beginning of the year for one kid become extras in your kid’s teacher’s cart at target during a grocery run and forget the $10 oh no multiply that sucker by – how many kids were in that classroom? was it 20? 30? let’s see does your job ask you to shell out a couple hundred bucks to upgrade your software or buy staples? and if it’s teaching your kid how to multiply better or be able to compose a sentence without referring to spell check, isn’t that extra $10 a little worth it? i’m frustrated by our entitlement we act like we’re doing the schools and the teachers a favor when we fill that backpack with tissues and markers umm, let’s back up a minute aren’t they the ones doing us the favor? i mean, are we willing to take a step (or 200) backward and fill in gaps caused by something as silly as a distracted kid (who then distracts others) because he can’t find a glue stick to finish his project? and yes, we went through school without some of these things, but these kids are more accustomed to bright and shiny maybe sad, but still true and if bright and shiny go away, attention spans shorten, and kids are more disruptive and guess what? kids don’t learn as well then i’m frustrated that we can’t see just how big a job these incredibly underpaid teachers are undertaking so, my suggestion is to watch for sales and stock up buy the extra box of tissues do the right thing and thank that teacher for all the efforts to make our future decision-makers great ones be frustrated with me for the right reasons

Article - good news for romantics: the divorce rate may be dismal, but remarriage is on the rise according to new findings from the pew research center, 40 percent of marriages involve one spouse whos been married before in 20 percent of new marriages, both spouses have previously said i do theres so much dialogue right now about the retreat from marriage in general, gretchen livingston, senior researcher at pew and author of the study, told the huffington post i was really curious to juxtapose that with whats going on with remarriage livingston analyzed data from the 2013 american community survey as well as the 1960 and 1980 censuses and found that the number of remarried adults in the us has hit 42 million, which is almost double the amount recorded in 1980 and triple the amount in 1960 but not everyone is jumping to remarry -- after combining the hard data on remarriage patterns with the results of a recent pew survey about marriage, livingston found that specific demographics are actually less likely to remarry than others among those who are divorced or widowed, age made a big difference in desire to remarry there are two demographic shifts that can account for this general surge in remarriage, according to livingston for one, the divorce rate is higher now than it was in 1960, so the number of people who are, as she put it, eligible to remarry has also risen (but its worth noting that the divorce rate peaked in 1981 and has been slowly declining and leveling off ever since) the more influential factor in the high remarriage rate, however, is a longer life expectancy for partners, particularly among baby boomers while only 34 percent of those who were 65 and older (and eligible to remarry) had remarried in 1960, 50 percent of that same demographic had remarried in 2013 the older you are, the more likely you are to have ever remarried, because you have more time in your life to have married once, gotten divorced or widowed and found someone else and remarried, livingston said younger americans went the opposite direction: 75 percent of people ages 25 to 34 and eligible to remarry were remarried in 1960, while only 43 percent of that same demographic were remarried in 2013 its very possible that this younger group of contemporary divorcees and widows hasnt soured on the institution of marriage completely, however livingston pointed out that, since younger demographics have tended to delay marriage -- the average age of first marriage is now is about 27 for women and 29 for men, as opposed to 21 for women and 24 for men in 1960 -- perhaps this group is content to cohabit with partners or advance the relationship in other ways, rather than jump into marriage number two overall, women were less likely than men to want to walk down the aisle again age wasnt the only differentiating factor, though when pew polled participants for the aforementioned survey on marriage, they asked single men and women who had been married before if they would be willing to marry again there was a clear gender divide: divorced or widowed men were more likely to want to remarry than women in the same position a majority of once-married, eligible men -- 65 percent -- either expressed a desire to remarry or were still considering it in comparison, 43 percent of women said theyd be willing to remarry and 54 percent specifically didnt want to ever marry again only 30 percent of men were completely against the idea of a second walk down the aisle previous studies have suggested that men enjoy more health benefits, relationship satisfaction and economic perks from marriage than women do livingston said its quite possible that widowed or divorced men have more motivation to jump back into a new marriage and regain those aforementioned comforts another interesting finding combined both age and gender: in remarriages, 16 percent of couples involve a husband who is at least 10 years older than his wife this age gap falls to a mere 4 percent in first-time married couples if you consider that 39 percent of first-time newlyweds (and 21 percent of remarried couples) are within a year of each others ages, this age gap among remarried couples becomes particularly noteworthy but dont make too many assumptions about newlyweds -- its a demographic thats still in flux while todays divorce rate might make newlyweds of the 1960s cringe, that doesnt mean that todays society has lost faith in marriage in fact, according to pew, previously married people these days are just as willing to remarry as they were back in 1960 taken together, these findings can add more detail to an ever-shifting image of the american family maybe newlyweds dont look quite as fresh-faced as they did in the late 60s, livingston said, noting once again that 40 percent of todays newlywed couples involve at least one person whos been married before but i think its very striking and just another example of how the definitions of family and the norm are changing

Article - the morning plum: the other day, new york times polling analyst nate cohn laid down a useful marker for gauging whether the conditions are taking shape for hillary clinton to crush donald trump in a landslide cohn noted that the gop nominee is viewed as fundamentally unfit for the job by an unusually large percentage of republican voters, perhaps creating unique complications in the quest to unify them many republican voters have an unfavorable impression of him — worse still, many don’t even think he has the knowledge, temperament or qualifications to be president, cohn wrote if mr trump can’t reunify republican-leaning voters, mrs clinton really could win in a landslide speaking in warren, mich, on aug 11, democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton outlined her vision for the us economy (the washington post) today brings new polling that suggests these conditions may indeed may taking shape the new nbc news/survey monkey tracking poll finds clinton leading trump among registered voters nationally by 50-41 even more crucially, clinton is demolishing trump on the question of who has the right personality and temperament to be president: 42 percent of voters say clinton does, versus only 17 percent who say trump does but note trump’s numbers among republicans on the temperament question: fewer than one in five republicans believe trump has the right personality and temperament to serve as president (by contrast, 39 percent of democrats say that about clinton) now, this is only one poll, and the temperament numbers for both candidates were perhaps driven downward by the question wording, which did not poll each individual trait in a separate question, instead asking respondents to pick all the traits that apply but this general finding shows up in other polls, too a recent washington post/abc news survey found that a surprisingly high 23 percent of republicans agreed that trump is not qualified to serve as president, while 74 percent said he is qualified among all adults, 61 percent said trump is not qualified meanwhile, the post/abc poll also found that a staggering 34 percent of republicans say trump does not have the right kind of personality and temperament to serve effectively as president, while 67 percent of overall americans said the same for clinton, the percentages of democrats who said she was unfit for the job by both those metrics was in single digits, while large majorities of overall adults gave her the thumbs-up on them this basic imbalance is one of the under-appreciated narratives of this race it regularly gets lost amid claims that both candidates are historically disliked while this is true, the underlying and arguably more important story is that in spite of this, only one of the two candidates is widely seen as fundamentally prepared and qualified for the presidency, while the other is widely seen as unprepared and lacking in the basic qualities required for it and this core imbalance goes deeper: only one of them is seen as unfit by surprisingly large percentages of voters from his or her own party to be clear, trump could obviously still win this race or make it very close, if he succeeds in uniting republican voters in the home stretch it seems very likely to tighten external events or new clinton revelations could still shake things up but the conventions are over, and the clinton team — operating with a candidate with very real weaknesses of her own — appears to be well on its way towards accomplishing its goal of making this election all about trump’s increasingly obvious temperamental unfitness and lack of qualifications for the job with a healthy assist from trump himself, of course 1 of 57 full screen autoplay close skip ad × hillary clinton’s campaign comes to an end view photos hillary clinton loses to donald trump in the 2016 presidential election caption hillary clinton loses to donald trump in the 2016 presidential election nov 9, 2016 hillary clinton speaks in new york while her husband, former president bill clinton, applauds melina mara/the washington post buy photo wait 1 second to continue ***************************************************************************** * clinton holds wide lead in virginia: a new washington post poll finds that clinton leads trump in virginia by 52-38 among registered voters and by 51-43 among likely voters note: the poll also finds that trump is viewed unfavorably by 70 percent of women and 70 percent of white college graduates this once again suggests that trump’s failure to broaden his appeal is putting him at a major disadvantage in states that are supposed to be very close (as virginia was in 2012) * quote of the day, everyone-hates-trump edition: the post write-up of the new virginia poll includes this gem from a republican-leaning voter in the state: walt purnell, 71, a retired business executive from ashburn, had hoped to vote for jeb bush — or john kasich or marco rubio or chris christie but trump? no way i think he’s a failure, i think he’s a fraud, i think he’s a con artist, i think he’s insane, purnell said have we mentioned that this election is becoming a referendum on trump’s fundamental unfitness for the job? * clinton owns the airwaves: chuck todd, mark murray and the first read crew serve up these striking numbers: hillary clinton’s campaignhas spent $61 million over the airwaves, while pro-clinton outside groups have chipped in an additional $43 million that’s a combined $104 million in total ad spending for team clinton but in that same time frame, donald trump’s campaign still hasn’t spent a single cent on a general-election ad, with two pro-trump outside groups coming to the rescue with $124 million over the airwaves that’s a nearly 9-to-1 advantage in ad spending it’s another fundamental trumpian disadvantage that could grow more pronounced in the home stretch * trump would probably send troops to mideast: the new york times makes a good point about trump’s big foreign policy speech yesterday: though mr trump made no reference to whether he would send more american troops back to the region, that appeared to be the clear implication the kind of relentless attacks on the islamic state he advocates — along with taking and holding the oil fields, which may well be a violation of international law — would require a considerable presence by american troops or their allies, and foreign bases to launch the drones trump’s promise is basically to promise to crush the terrorist enemy while vowing no messy entanglements abroad it’s a scam * trump’s policy gibberish: trump is now proposing to impose a new ideological test on those trying to enter the country from areas scarred by terrorism cnn analyst peter bergen explains why the idea is half baked at best: this seems unworkable for example, would anyone sitting for these tests volunteer that they had secret proclivities for jihadist terrorism? also, trump didn’t specify what countries would be affected by this new test but france has a serious domestic terrorism problem — would french citizens be subjected to this kind of test?in short, trump didn’t say who would be targeted for these ideological tests, saying only that he would consult the state department about how to approach this issue the idea is really an effort to repackage trump’s muslim ban as somehow being in sync with american values * trump’s big lie about isis: trump continues to claim (as he did in his speech yesterday) that obama policies were the chief cause of isis glenn kessler corrects the record: this is false and facile the terror group is the direct result of the us invasion of iraq in 2003at best, one could argue that actions that obama failed to take (over clinton’s opposition) helped contribute to the growth of isis what’s always missing from trump’s account is that clinton was more hawkish than obama was meanwhile, kessler’s interview with author joby warrick explores all this in more detail * trump may cost gop a generation of voters: trump is getting slaughtered among younger voters michael gerson reflects on the reasons for this and its potential consequences: younger voters are less likely than other age groups to regard racially inclusive language as politically correct they are less likely to believe in reverse discrimination and to embrace anti-immigrant attitudesyoung people understand the logo of the republican nomineeas conveying a message of exclusion these are the first serious political impressions of my younger son, voting in his first presidential election this year it is the way to lose a generation never trump conservatives and democrats both agree that the gop’s nomination of trump provides a unique opportunity to tarnish the gop among a whole new generation * clinton prepares for slime-fest debate: politico’s annie karni reports that the clinton team is preparing for the absolute worst at the debates with trump: the person picked to be hillary clinton’s sparring partner in her upcoming debate prep sessions is expected to confront her about the death of vincent foster, label her as a rapist’s enabler, and invoke the personally painful memories of monica lewinsky and gennifer flowersone of the key components of that prepis finding a person who can stand in as donald trump during mock debates and launch personal attacksthat will make the real trump look tame by comparison cue up a fresh round of commentary claiming that trump’s street fighting debate style should make democrats very, very afraid — even though thus far it has been a buffoonish failure

call me emmett neither category applied it felt not only like i was invisible but, especially at that time when hormones are aflutter, like no one would really know what i was like for the rest of my life gieselman began spending time at outright vermont, a trans and queer youth center where the gender lexicon of activists and academe is widely accepted as soon as i learned about a genderqueer identity, i was like, ‘oh! that’s the one!’ said gieselman, who frequently ends sentences with a gentle laugh before, it had been really difficult to explain how i was feeling to other people, and even really difficult to explain it in my own head suddenly, there was a language for it, and that started the journey gieselman dumped the girlie name bestowed at birth, asked friends and teachers to use rocko, the tough-sounding nickname friends had come up with, and told people to use they instead of he or she they has become an increasingly popular substitute for he or she in the transgender community, and the university of vermont, a public institution of some 12,700 students, has agreed to use it while colleges across the country have been grappling with concerns related to students transitioning from one gender to another, vermont is at the forefront in recognizing the next step in identity politics: the validation of a third gender the university allows students like gieselman to select their own identity — a new first name, regardless of whether they’ve legally changed it, as well as a chosen pronoun — and records these details in the campuswide information system so that professors have the correct terminology at their fingertips for years, writers and academics have argued that gender identity is not a male/female binary but a continuum along which any individual may fall, depending on a variety of factors, including anatomy, chromosomes, hormones and feelings but the dichotomy is so deeply embedded in our culture that even the most radical activists had been focused mainly on expanding the definitions of the two pre-existing categories today, a growing number of students are embracing the idea that when it comes to classifying gender, there should be more than two options — something now afforded by the dating website okcupid and by facebook, which last year added a tab for custom alongside male and female, with some 50 options, including agender, androgyne, pangender and trans person, as well as an option for controlling who can see the customized version activists on campuses as diverse as penn state, university at albany, university of chicago, university of wisconsin, milwaukee, and university of california, riverside, are laying claim to a degree of identity freedom nearly unimaginable when the first lgbt student centers were established today’s students, who grew up with gay-straight alliances in their high schools, with transgender people represented in the media and with transgender rights percolating through the courts, arrived on campuses already lgbt-friendly and, in many cases, equipped with gender-neutral housing and bathrooms in hopes of raising consciousness of the biases built into social structures and into the language we use to discuss them, students are organizing identity conferences and inventing new vocabularies, which include pronouns like ze and xe, and pressing administrations to make changes that validate, in language, the existence of a gender outside the binary certainly, there’s a long line of people throughout history whose traits have put them outside norms, and some cultures long ago formalized the existence of a gender that isn’t purely female or purely male, like the american indian’s two-spirits or india’s hijras but the binary is a belief system at least as old as adam and eve, and most people don’t even realize it’s there it’s like a constant coming-out process, educating those around you that there is a gender binary, and this is what it means to identify outside of it, said gieselman, who works on campus planning gender-related events identifying as genderqueer is an opportunity to self-invent, unburdened from social expectations about dress and behavior occasionally gieselman wishes for a lower voice and flatter chest, but other times feels ok with, even happy about, having a feminine physique even within the same day or the next day i can suddenly really love how my chest looks in a sundress, said gieselman, who wears two small nose rings in the bedroom closet hang t-shirts, flannels, dresses and a rack of bow ties it might seem a simple turn of events, but adding gender-neutral options to the university of vermont’s information system took nearly a decade of lobbying, the creation of a task force of students, faculty members and administrators, and six months and $80,000 in staff time to create a software patch one key to the developments is dorothea brauer, a plain-spoken, big-hearted mental health counselor known to everyone as dot ms brauer spent nine years working at the campus counseling center before becoming, in 2001, the director of what was then called the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning & ally center while in her 20s and living in new jersey, ms brauer, who wears her hair cut short with a single, long braid down her back in tribute to a cherokee grandmother, was spending time with a woman when an acquaintance changed the course of her life by inquiring about the relationship, and then pointedly but nonjudgmentally asking, honey, are you gay? i said, ‘well, yeah, but only with anita,’  recalled ms brauer (anita would turn out to be her life partner — 32 years and counting) that’s how clueless i was, she said, chuckling over a taco salad lunch at the penny cluse café in downtown burlington i was 24, 25, and scared to death i came out to my mother, only my mother, because i became physically ill with depression a decade later, as one of the few out women on campus in the 1990s, she treated students with debilitating identity issues, some of whom attempted suicide or faced a psychotic break (lgbtq youth are more than twice as likely to attempt suicide as their heterosexual peers, according to the centers for disease control and prevention) ms brauer’s first act upon being installed as the center’s director was to assign a graduate student to research and catalog the unmet needs of the transgender community among the difficulties faced by transgender students: inability to use bathrooms marked men or women for fear of a confrontation with a confused classmate; being accused of using a stolen student id in the cafeteria because the name printed on it didn’t match someone’s gender appearance; and having the faculty rely on a student-information system that listed only legal names, leading to occasions when a student might be embarrassed or inadvertently outed ms brauer heard about one distraught transgender freshman whose professor, while calling roll, first read the student’s feminine legal name, then announced the male nickname ms brauer reached out to the registrar, keith p williams, who worked with the university’s lawyers to allow transgender students to change their first name in the schoolwide system, but doing so required an in-person visit to the dean of students’ office and filling out paperwork she then set to work waging a campaign to educate, face to face, members of the faculty, staff and administration on why language sensitivity was so important to a student’s self-respect — and assisted students in getting school policy amended to specifically prohibit discrimination based on gender identity by 2009, faculty members themselves began pushing for a broader solution to the identification issue, and mr williams created a task force to look into how students could register a preferred first name without having to make a special request the task force realized that the only way to guarantee a professor would properly refer to a student was to supply the student’s pronoun on class rosters and advisee lists then came the question of which gender-neutral pronoun to offer students proposed ‘they/them’ pronouns, but the faculty vetoed the idea because they said it is grammatically incorrect, mr williams recalled they said, ‘you don’t put a plural pronoun with a single individual’ a second option, also being used in various trans communities, was ze (pronounced zee), a riff on the german pronoun sie, with hir replacing his/her bowing to the faculty, the task force selected ze and revised its information system, becoming the first school in the nation at which students could select their pronoun they could also leave the field blank, or opt for name only, indicating a preference for being referred to by name instead of by pronoun the change fueled gender-awareness campaigns by students all over the country so many administrators were receiving requests that, in 2012, the american association of collegiate registrars and admissions officers convened a task force to draft a list of best practices for handling transgender student records so far, about 100 schools now allow students, and sometimes employees, to indicate a moniker other than their legal first name, according to the consortium of higher education lgbt resource professionals, and hundreds more have contacted vermont on how to implement the pronoun choice in september, the university’s pronoun options were expanded yet again to include they, as grammarians have reminded naysayers that the english language is constantly evolving since 2009, 1,891 university of vermont students have specified a preferred pronoun, with 14 opting for ze, 10 for they and another 228 for name only on campuses across the country gender-conscious students have adopted the earnest, pc practice of starting social interactions by introducing themselves by name and pgp, or preferred gender pronoun (the most semantically obsessed still object to the word preferred) robyn ochs, an educator who helped found an early lgbt faculty and staff group at harvard, believes that vermont’s changes are nothing less than lifesaving some people try to reduce this whole topic to kids trying to be cool or they’re just acting out or whatever, just trying to be different or new, said ms ochs, who has visited some 500 campuses to speak on lgbt issues, and often facilitates a discussion she calls beyond binaries but there have always been people who have felt profoundly uncomfortable in their assigned gender roles, she said anything we can do to make them safer, or make them feel recognized, heard, seen, understood, we should do to validate their identity and experience could, in fact, save their life how does one explain to family members what it means to be neither male nor female? once, at age 15, in conversation with an aunt at the kitchen table, gieselman tried unsuccessfully to diagram the concepts of gender and sex on a napkin, with gender referring to the attitudes and behaviors a society associates with a person’s biological sex, and sex referring to a person’s biological status (not to be confused with sexual orientation, one’s romantic interests) i don’t even know what it was i was trying to show, gieselman, an eighth-generation vermonter, recounted with a laugh gieselman’s grandmother, too, had a few questions about the napkin they were very confused, gieselman said, and still are sara miller, gieselman’s mother, said that when her teenager first came out to her and offered to provide a pronoun chart for reference, she scoffed at the time, it irritated me to no end, said ms miller, a social worker i was like, ‘really? this is what our struggle is going to be about? pronouns?’ but ms miller has learned to accept the person her former little girl has become it’s grown out of the process of really seeing how rocko has grown as an individual and an adult, seeing how rocko is their own person, and not a child, ms miller said this is how they presents themself to new friends and colleagues and employers and students that group knows rocko only that way although ms miller tries her best to always use they/them pronouns, she often slips up, but gieselman isn’t bothered rocko and i have an understanding she knows i try, said ms miller, slipping up again at last summer’s orientation for new faculty members, ms brauer handed out pocket-size pronoun charts created by the lgbt resource center at the university of wisconsin, milwaukee she also gave out her cellphone number and words of support: if you’re struggling with it, give me a call any time and i’ll walk you through it, and give you time to practice, and walk you through any questions you might have use of they/them is so widely accepted in the politically correct enclave that is burlington that a colleague at feldman’s bagels, where gieselman works part time, recently asked if it was ok to correct a customer who uses the wrong pronoun because she knew gieselman wouldn’t i know if something might be bothering them, they wouldn’t necessarily say something about it, said alexa ciecierski, a morning-shift co-worker at the apartment that afternoon, gieselman talked excitedly about finally receiving documentation of a legal name change, which arrived in the mail that afternoon, and showed off several gig posters brought home by a roommate, who manages local bands on the coffee table, a collection of angel cards filled a small bowl, each billet offering a single word like discernment or balance or integrity, meant to be chosen and read for a daily dose of inspiration do you want to pick one? gieselman asked me i reached in the bowl and pulled out strength gieselman leaned forward off the futon, swished the cards around, plucked one from the center, smiled, then read it aloud: freedom

Article - it is 20 years since bolivias chaotic san pedro prison became a tourist attraction, a place where backpackers stayed for weeks and partied with inmates the story was immortalised in a best-selling book, marching powder, and now the books protagonist - a former inmate - and author have reunited to return to the prison for a new documentary film the inmate, thomas mcfadden, says returning to his old cell scared him but i always wanted to go back to bolivia, and there was always a strong connection between me and rusty rusty young wrote marching powder in his twenties, when as a young backpacker from sydney, australia, he stayed in the prison, and later helped secure mr mcfaddens release by posing as an international human rights lawyer it all began when mr mcfadden, a british-tanzanian, was caught smuggling cocaine in la paz airport in 1996 and found himself jailed in a place more like a warped small town than a prison prisoners were expected to earn a living inside and buy their cells as if they were real estate there was a primary school for the prisoners children, who they brought to live with them, and in the most notorious twist of all, there was an in-house cocaine factory i thought what is this place? i even had to pay my own taxi fare to get there, thomas mcfadden remembers today after his release in 2000, he left those days far behind and is now a chicken farmer in tanzania however, his life-changing friendship with his brother rusty has gone the distance, and he has even named one of his children after him their unusual relationship began when mr young joined one of the illegal prison tours that the inmate ran for foreign backpackers from early 1997 until his release word had spread around local hostels that there was an english-speaking inmate who would show visitors around this strange microcosm centrally located in downtown la paz, the prison became a tourist attraction that featured in lonely planet guidebooks travellers paid an entrance fee and, in some cases, opted to stay for weeks, partying with the inmates lydia docking, a british traveller, went on not just one but repeated trips to the prison in 2008, led by a prisoner from portugal one of the other backpackers she met on her first day there later became her husband as a conversation starter, we used to say we met in a bolivian jail, she says from her new home in sydney she was 24 at the time and is 33 now their san pedro tour guide came to their wedding after his release, and although the couple has since separated, she still has their dog, named pedro after the prison despite her jokes, she is acutely well aware of the darker side of the story im still confused by it, still processing it, she says over the course of three weeks, we went most days i sometimes question why it was mostly just to share experiences and to understand how lives start the same but can take such different paths san pedro prison remains operational today, despite many plans to close it for years, its tours were an open secret, but one day in 2009 a local television crew arrived to get footage for a story about a politician held inside while waiting in the plaza outside, the cameramen caught a steady stream of tourists going in armed with the footage, the bolivian press ran with the story the main concern locally was not the tourists but the alleged corruption of the authorities, who were thought to be taking a cut of the tours profits who is watching the police? asked an editorial in la razon newspaper during the ensuing clean-up, prisoners had their visitors rights revoked for a day a riot followed and around 80 children were evacuated in 2013, the story took an even darker turn when news spread of a 12-year-old girl becoming pregnant inside the jail, after an alleged rape by her imprisoned father and other men child welfare charities called for a ban on children living inside large-scale tours of the prison are no longer possible today backpackers typically opt for la paz walking tours, which stop outside the prison walls and tell marching powders story when rusty young and thomas mcfadden returned to the prison for their forthcoming documentary wildlands, they happened upon one such tour group and snuck alongside them, incognito they kept making factual errors, so i couldnt help asking smart-arsed questions, says mr young eventually an irish traveller, who had just read the book, recognised the pair he whispered, youre rusty, youre thomas! and we sneaked off together for a beer back in 2000, the two men travelled to colombia, after mr mcfaddens release they found work as english teachers and worked on the book, which became a new york times best-seller thomas then moved to tanzania, and rusty went back to australia, where after the huge success of marching powder he had difficult-second-book syndrome his novel colombiano, about a teenager who gets drawn into a colombian terrorist organisation, is due out later this year the documentary wildlands uses their story in san pedro prison as a launch pad for exploring all sides of the drugs trade, and includes interviews with former undercover us police agents and an assassin who was a right-hand man to colombian drug lord pablo escobar but the long-awaited marching powder feature film may still be years away the rights were acquired by brad pitts production company but have since expired narcos director jose padilha has been linked to the screenplay, and don cheadle and then chiwetel ejiofor expressed interest in playing thomas mcfadden, but filming never got off the ground as for the sequel to the book, perhaps that will come sooner my publishers been harassing me about that for years, says rusty we already have a title: marching on

Article_Title - ""pluto’s little sister"" makemake has something even pluto doesn’t
Article - the dwarf planet makemake, discovered in 2005, is cold, dark and remote it sits in the kuiper belt beyond neptune, orbiting the sun at a distance almost 46 times farther away than earth and completing an orbit once every 310 earth-years recent observation by the hubble space telescope, however, has revealed that makemake is not as lonely as it once appeared: it has a moon finding a dark moon until this new discovery, scientists believed makemake was the only one of the four officially recognized dwarf planets in the kuiper belt (pluto, haumea, makemake and eris) without a moon - the fifth official dwarf planet, ceres, is closer to earth and also moonless however, there were some inconsistencies in prior measurements of makemake’s light and heat observations from the spitzer and herschel space telescopes revealed warm, dark areas on makemake’s otherwise bright, cold surface however, makemake’s apparently mottled surface would not make sense with a normally rotating dwarf planet unless it was spinning with one of its poles facing directly toward earth, a fairly unlikely situation the dark moon hypothesis offered a simpler explanation: a charcoal-black moon orbiting makemake imagine that the dark material isn’t on makemake’s surface it’s in orbit! image analysis lead and paper coauthor alex parker tweeted if the moon is very dark, it accounts for most previous thermal measurements! makemake is the second-farthest away of the official dwarf planets (eris is the farthest) and the second-brightest (after pluto) while it may seem strange that astronomers had been able to see moons around farther and dimmer planets while missing makemake’s moon, the reality is that this moon, informally called mk2, was very good at remaining hidden mk2 is over 1300 times dimmer and much smaller than makemake, and its orbit appears to be edge-on to earth, so we don’t see it circling makemake, only oscillating back and forth looking for it is like looking for a firefly flitting back and forth across a spotlight if you watch it long enough and are lucky enough to look at the right time, as this team of astronomers did, the firefly might look obvious (in parker’s words, not actually that faint), but it was easy to miss before part of a team from the southwest research institute in boulder, colorado, parker was the first to notice makemake’s moon in data from the hubble space telescope at first, he thought someone else must have already seen it just to be sure, he asked collaborator and team leader marc buie, has anyone seen the moon in the makemake data? when buie replied, there’s a moon in the makemake data? they knew they’d made a major discovery the moon in the data it is unclear where exactly the moon came from or why its surface is black more observations of mk2 from hubble will help astronomers determine whether its orbit is circular or elliptical, which will provide clues to its origin if mk2’s orbit is elongated, it was probably simply captured in makemake’s gravity as it floated by many smaller kuiper belt objects have dark surfaces like mk2 this is often because they are too small and their gravity too weak to keep bright ices (like the ones that cover makemake) in place however, mk2’s darkness could be due to constant interactions with the escaping atmospheric gases streaming off makemake: like the top of a hearth blackened with ash, it could have accumulated compounds from makemake’s past atmosphere if mk2’s orbit is circular, as preliminary estimates indicate, the moon may be merely debris from a collision between makemake and another kuiper belt object if mk2 was created by an enormous crash between two kuiper belt objects, according to the paper, the apparent ubiquity of trans-neptunian dwarf planet satellites further supports the idea that giant collisions are a near-universal fixture in the histories of these distant worlds if all of the dwarf planets have satellites (moons), that may mean that kuiper belt objects are often subjected to huge impacts the new, improved makemake system while mk2 does create questions about the makemake system and the kuiper belt, it will also provide answers according to parker, the discovery of this moon has given us an opportunity to study makemake in far greater detail than we ever would have been able to without the companion  makemake is sometimes referred to as pluto’s little sister because of their similarities: both are dwarf planets, both have surfaces coated in methane ice, and both have temperatures that can drop to -400 degrees fahrenheit the discovery that makemake has a moon adds yet another similarity to pluto when pluto’s largest moon, charon, was discovered in 1978, it led to enormous new insights about pluto itself, including that it was hundreds of times lighter than was originally estimated thats the kind of transformative measurement that having a satellite can enable, parker said: mk2 will almost definitely lead to a fundamental change in how we view the dwarf planet makemake looking at how mk2 orbits makemake will allow scientists to calculate the system’s mass and probe its inner composition as caltech’s mike brown, a member of the team that discovered makemake in 2005, said, the wide range of densities of the dwarf planets is one of the most interesting mysteries out there but we still have so few objects that each one adds a critical part of the story small worlds like makemake display a variety of internal compositions: they can contain rock and water ice, as well as other, more exotic ices and compounds since mk2 will allow scientists to tell makemake’s density and thus the densities of the materials it’s made of, it provides a new clue about the family of dwarf planets the james webb space telescope, scheduled to launch in 2018, will be able to conclusively test the dark moon hypothesis even before then, though, information about makemake and its moon will continue to accumulate from new hubble observations, teaching us about the outskirts of our solar system this new discovery opens a new chapter in comparative planetology in the outer solar system, buie said, and it will add to our understanding of the many worlds around us

character in commercials for dos equis after first moving to los angeles, he worked on a garbage truck, according to an npr interview he lied his way into westerns, pretending to know how to ride a

Article - infertility is no longer seen only in women with the adoption of modern lifestyles, men, too are becoming infertile these days a renowned gynecologist and infertility and in vitro fertilisation specialist, dr sonia malik, at one of the leading fertility treatment centres in new delhi, stated that 46% of indians, between the ages of 31 and 40 years, need medical intervention to conceive this is because one or both partners in the relationship are suffering from fertility problems another city gynaecologist named, dr yashica gudesar, said one of the main reasons causing infertility is polycystic ovarian disorder in women and reduced sperm count in men studies also suggest that it is wrong to blame the women all the time for being infertile statistically, in nearly 30% of all infertility cases, men have been found to be infertile, as per society for the study of male reproduction some of the reasons that doctors have stated for this problem is irregular working hours and work stress in the it, media industry and bpos apparently, constant use of android or iphone affects sperm count as they have higher emission rate environmental pollution also to some extent contributes to low sperm count the food you eat and your sleeping patterns have also found to affect the quality of sperms and eggs these days moreover, men who smoke cigarettes regularly are at an increased risk of infertility says, dr ved prakash but dear men, worry not! there is a solution to every problem and while cutting down on your smokes and adopting a better lifestyle is one of them, it’s not the only one ivf or intracytoplasmic sperm injection offers a good chance of pregnancy nowadays, people are becoming more open to consulting ivf centers for problems relating to infertility such as erectile dysfunction, or not being able to have a child however, the treatments aren’t very budget-friendly the minimum a couple spends on this is rs 1 lakh, which could be a matter of concern to a lot of individuals it’s okay to believe in the concept of yolo, but what’s the point if it’s not going to give you all the happiness you need to live happily?

Article_Title - hillary clinton is advertising in deep-red nebraska here’s why
Article - a democratic presidential candidate has not won a majority of votes in nebraska for more than 50 years but on thursday, hillary clinton’s campaign announced it would begin spending precious advertising dollars in the state the advertising buy is focused on nebraska’s second congressional district, and includes two ads about clinton’s advocacy for children it is an expensive bet on a state that has almost always voted red but there’s a simple reason behind what seems like a gamble: nebraska allocates its electoral college votes not in the usual winner-take-all method, but by congressional district so a republican candidate can win in the state, but a democratic candidate can still pick up electoral votes by winning over a district the second congressional district, which is centered in omaha and its suburbs, has a history of occasionally voting differently from the rest of deep-red nebraska the district went for mitt romney in 2012 but for then-sen barack obama in 2008 in 2014, when democrats lost a wave of congressional races across the country, democrat brad ashford won the district’s seat in us congress and as a clinton aide pointed out, the african-american share of the vote in the district is higher than the statewide average—and clinton has shown she consistently over-performs among black voters the electoral college’s winner-take-all system means that reliably democratic states like massachusetts and oregon—or reliably republican states like texas and alabama—are never seriously contested by presidential candidates they predictably vote democratic or republican but in nebraska and maine—the two states that allocate their electoral votes by congressional district—there is more room for the parties to maneuver they can spend ad dollars and campaign in states that they could never win outright it’s an electoral strategy that donald trump is hoping to take advantage of, too this week he campaigned in maine, which also allocates its electoral votes by congressional district but usually supports a democrat he held a rally in bangor in the state’s second congressional district, which is predominantly white and rural clinton has begun a broad and expensive advertising campaign in the swing states that you’d expect: florida, ohio, colorado, iowa, nevda, new hampshire, virginia, north carolina in those states, as well as in her nebraska ad buy, clinton has aired advertisements that tout her role in the creation of the children’s health insurance program in the 1990s these are the two ads that will be playing in nebraska

Article - the morning plum: believe it or not, donald trump has now made a very important policy statement introducing what he billed as an energy plan, trump promised to cancel the paris climate plan unlike so much of what comes from trump on policy, this is a genuinely clarifying moment, with potentially enormous long-term implications the near-term political consequences of this will — or should — be that there is now no chance whatsoever that bernie sanders will do anything at all on his way out that could imperil party unity in a way that makes a trump victory more likely i don’t believe sanders has any intention to do that, by the way, but this should theoretically render it an impossibility in his mind, because it dramatically increases the stakes for a relatively smooth resolution of the democratic primaries indeed, i believe it’s likely sanders will see it this way, too to get all the details on trump’s full energy plan, read brad plumer’s piece trump would pursue a mostly standard-issue gop agenda of fewer regulations and more fossil fuel production more important, with some reporters wondering what trump’s actual views are on global climate change, he clarified them: he is utterly indifferent to its existence and would roll back the main things we’re currently putting in place to deal with it trump said that the current environmental challenges that the obama administration is trying to tackle are phony he added that he would rescind the epa’s clean power plan, which would curb carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal-fired power plants, and is key to the us’s ability to meet its commitments as part of the global climate deal he would withdraw the us from participation in that global accord as i’ve reported before, there are complexities that could make it harder than expected for a republican president — even one as masterfully competent and strong as trump — to roll back the clean power plan and/or withdraw from the paris climate deal but it’s possible that trump could accomplish one or both of these, which would be a tremendous setback this deepens the contrast between trump and hillary clinton while clinton would not be as ambitious as sanders in tackling the climate challenge, the unalterable fact of the matter is that clinton would preserve and implement the clean power plan and the global climate accord, and trump would seek to reverse them both sanders has repeatedly described the climate challenge as the single greatest long-term threat we face: climate change is the single greatest threat facing our planet — bernie sanders (@berniesanders) april 7, 2016 and: as a father of four and a grandfather of seven, i care about leaving a healthy, livable planet for all of our kids and grandchildren — bernie sanders (@berniesanders) april 7, 2016 it’s true that sanders has criticized the global climate deal as insufficient but sanders surely knows that continuing to implement it — and the clean power plan — are infinitely preferable to rolling them back, which could lay the groundwork for catastrophe sanders knows that the paris accord may end up being our best near term hope for building an international effort to tackle the climate problem implementing it could allow us to get to the point where dramatic innovations in energy technology begin to make solving the problem a realistic possibility what’s more, even if the paris accord is currently not enough, it can be built upon later the accord is not guaranteed to succeed, but trying to implement and build upon it makes success more likely obviously, if our participation in it is canceled, building upon it is no longer possible it is often said that sanders may not help to unify the party because he has nothing to lose from a democratic loss i think that is wrong — i believe sanders when he says a trump presidency is unthinkable and at any rate, the incentives, if anything, favor sanders helping to unify the party, in order to maximize his and his movement’s influence going forward trump has now clarified beyond any doubt just how much, by sanders’ own lights, we all have to lose from a trump presidency my bet is sanders will seize on this to make the case to his supporters that the stakes in this election require a full commitment to trump’s defeat, even if that means supporting a flawed alternative

Article - all the best foods are doused in garlic, but what about the lonely times that come after the clove cramming? when accused of housing that garlicky stench, i tend to take offence and charge them with being ungrateful for me protecting them from vampires but if that doesn’t work, maybe you should try one of these scientifically proven odour eaters researchers from ohio state university found that the best foods to banish garlic breath are raw apple and raw lettuce, the huffington post reports volunteers were asked to chew garlic cloves for 25 seconds before trying water; raw, juiced or heated apple; raw or heated lettuce; raw or juiced mint leaves; or green tea, immediately after heated lettuce sounds fucking grim the researchers said foods deodorise garlic breath through two mechanisms – first, enzymes in the raw foods help to destroy the odours, and then, phenolic compounds in both the raw and cooked foods destroy the volatiles wikipedia they believe this is why raw foods were the most effective because they contain both the enzymes and the phenolic compounds although it didn’t get rid of the volatiles, mint leaves were best at masking the smell plus, an apple a day keeps the odours away to be honest, this has just made me really want to scoff a load of garlic bread (i’ll get some lettuce as well!)

Article - it is not uncommon to hear about somebody being stung by a bee or a wasp of some sort, as such type of insects and little bugs are very common in the outdoors while getting stung by a bumblebee may hurt, it is not dangerous at all and is in fact worse for the bee itself rather than for the person that got stung yellow jackets and wasps pose a whole new threat though, because they are faster, stronger, and have much more powerful poison in their stingers than bees do that is why if somebody is allergic to bee stings, getting stung by a wasp can be extremely painful, and sometimes even fatal if not handled correctly one man from tampa, florida, was out gardening on a seemingly normal day when he did not notice a wasp nest hidden beneath some plants in his front lawn john clark missed the nest, and accidentally stepped on it, ushering a swarm of yellow jackets to come out and attack him john got stung four times, and made his way inside to rest and get treatment hi wife went and grabbed john an ice pack to help reduce the swelling, and john sat down to try and recover from the extremely painful stings that were attacking his body soon after getting stung though, john started acting strange he started experiencing numbness, and had difficulty breathing something was evidently not right it was only an hour after getting stung when john was gasping for air and told his wife three last words, i love you before he took his last breath and died doctors did everything they could to get his system back up and running, but to no avail this was the case of a severe allergic reaction that john had experienced called anaphylaxis this type of condition can be triggered from an allergic reaction from a wasp like john was stung by, but this type of condition is extremely dangerous due to its stealth many people do not even know they can get anaphylaxis from a wasp or bee sting, and anybody can develop it at any point in their lifetime it is important to get tested for this type of reaction if you are going to be spending time outdoors or doing yard work you never know when you might get stung by a bee, even if it’s just doing the front garden like john was a simple way to prevent the severe and deadly reaction is with an epipen which injects a measured dose of epinephrine into your body to stop the reaction, but it must be taken in a very short time window after being stung

Article -  a met police officer with some confiscated drugs photo: tom johnson this post originally appeared on vice uk good cop, bad war is the story of an undercover police officer, neil woods, who spent over a decade infiltrating britains biggest drug gangs the book , released last week, provides a unique insight into a world of mind games and violence, where the drug trade acts as a production line for the creation of ruthless gangsters ultimately, his experiences led woods to reject the way drugs are policed in the uk the logic of the drugs war only leads one way: the police get smarter, so the criminals get nastier; things can only ever go from bad to worse, from savagery to savagery, says woods now, after having left the force, he is chairman of leap uk (law enforcement against prohibition), a pro-drug legalization activist group consisting of ex-law enforcement officials but to what extent are woods and his colleagues at leap uk—and those currently employed in the police force—rare specimens? how thin on the ground are drug cops who think they are fighting the wrong fight? expressing sympathy for anything other than hardline prohibition—even to their colleagues—is something of a risk in the black and white, them and us world of police culture even so, every now and then drug cops open up about the realities of clearing the streets of dealers and drugs  neil woods buying crack while undercover in 1995 photo courtesy of neil woods i spoke to mike fisher*, a senior drugs investigator for britains organized crime busting bureau, the national crime agency (nca) he asked for his name to be changed to avoid disciplinary action, as his views will definitely not be found anywhere near the pages of the ncas annual report if the nca stopped targeting drug gangs, it would change nothing, he explained you would see little change in the high street society would not collapse as it is, drugs are freely available now all that would happen is that dealing would be more open but it may give us more of a chance to deal with crimes such as homicide on the surface, its a counter-intuitive line to take for a senior officer working within an agency for which the drug trade is a key target law enforcement against drugs is completely ineffective and has been since the misuse of drugs act came into force in 1971, says fisher the idea of the state protecting you from yourself just doesnt work weve spent billions of pounds trying to prohibit drugs, but theres less chance of it working than canute stopping the waves  photo: andoni lubaki fisher tells me that arresting people on the streets for drugs is an endless cycle, and that its the same with the larger fish whenever we remove a big guy, someone else—usually a lieutenant—replaces him within days the more we try, the harder it gets: increased enforcement keeps these people looking over their shoulder; they become more covert about their activity, and that makes our job harder fishers solution is to take the portugal route: decriminalize personal use of all drugs, from cannabis to heroin, and look at legalizing production and supply i believe consenting adults have a choice as to what they put in their bodies it will also make it easier for heroin and crack users to get the help they need and free up police time to go out on patrol and deal with other crimes, he says ideally, production should be wrested from organized criminals and managed by governments surprisingly, he tells me around half of britains elite drug detectives at nca have similar liberal attitudes to the drugs problem but what about those drug cops working below nca level, in towns and cities across the uk? to gauge what they truly think about their daily task, you need to be a fly on the wall—so thats the exact position that university of sheffield criminologist dr matthew bacon took he spent two years embedded with drug detectives in a town and a major city (the identities of which are secret) in the uk and wrote about his experiences in taking care of business , published last month most officers were anti-drugs and fully supported prohibition drugs were seen as being behind all thats bad in society this gave them a righteousness in their actions, observed bacon but within this, recreational drug users, social dealers, and nightclubs were far less of a crime problem than alcohol, a drug which few officers had a problem with its perhaps not surprising, given the polices moral code, that most of the officers he hung around with viewed junkies as lazy, undeserving scumbags in 2012, a former undercover officer who disguised himself as a heroin user-dealer, told me: it made me realize how bad cops can be to drug addicts i was abused, assaulted, and threatened with being fitted up by having drugs planted on me on a regular basis to the anti-drug teams bacon shadowed, heroin dealers were one of the most despised groups in society, so much so that they were seen as police property—objects that police could do with as they wished almost without exception, dealers were depicted as deplorable and dangerous outlaws, says bacon they were made the scapegoat of the drug problem  photo: marco tulio valencia drug cops, who saw themselves as elite crime fighters, had sufficient respect however for the the mr bigs of the drug world they saw those who ran professional outfits and had families at home as worthy adversaries, and a good collar for which they would earn respect among their colleagues despite all this, there was acceptance—often expressed by officers off-duty after a few pints—that they were not waging a war on drugs, but managing an unbeatable problem in order to keep the public happy one detective sergeant told bacon: sometimes i think were like those [japanese] soldiers in world war ii—you know, those ones on the island who just kept fighting because they didnt know the war was over only difference is, wed lost the war before we even started fighting another officer told him: weve thrown everything at it, even the kitchen sink, but drug problems just keep getting worse in the end, the drugs are still on the streets, no matter how many people we lock up there are rebellious notions even among the rank and file when i went stop and searching in soho with one of the met polices sniffer dog teams in 2013, i was surprised to hear from a regular beat officer and his colleague that they thought cannabis should be legalized entirely i say legalize the lot, one said legalize it and tax it, said the other if someone wants to turn the sky green and the grass blue, then its up to them i cant see the difference between alcohol and cannabis the official line is that drugs are under control, but they are not i call up simon kempton, a police sergeant from dorset who has specialized in drug enforcement and sits on the national board of the police federation, a body that represents rank and file officers he agrees with woods—that the drug trade houses the most violent people in the country—but believes prohibition is crucial to taking them out i cant speak for everyone, but in my opinion drug policing is worthwhile, all day, every day, he says i get it: it can seem futile when we take out someone knocking out kilos of cocaine, [whos] replaced within two hours but the reason its worth doing is because the drug is not just about the drug trade: its weapons, terrorism, people trafficking, money laundering; it straddles the spectrum of the most serious crimes, such as murder, kidnapping, serious assault—which all go hand in hand with the drug trade we are taking out the worst people in our society when they assault people its not just a punch-up outside a pub; we are talking about sending a message through retribution and torture these people have to protect their trade from others, so they use extreme levels of violence you have to be the scariest, biggest person on the block, otherwise they will take your money from you undercover police officers would not take the huge risks infiltrating gangs if they did not think it was worthwhile undercover drug policing is not cheap, but its very cost effective its rare to get a not guilty after undercover work because of all the evidence thats been gathered yes, people can feel demoralized that theyve put themselves on the line, and then someone ends up getting just a coupe of years, but thats the way it is sometimes however, sgt kempton said that for rank and file officers, policing cannabis was another matter, and that many officers sympathized with the path taken by durham police in going easy on low-level cannabis offenses : with dwindling resources, forces are having to focus their limited numbers on areas which represent the greatest harms to wider society while policing cannabis is still a legitimate action, i believe most officers and the public would support a focus on other areas of crime over the years writing about the drug trade, ive met drug cops who have told me that their job is similar to that of the drug user or trafficker—a series of almost addictive drug bust hits that perpetuate the game there are some who have crossed the line completely to become dependent drug users themselves, and others who are disgusted by the stigmatization of drug users and even dealers one female drug cop i spoke to told me: there are some pretty nasty pieces of work out there, but some of them are just ordinary people behind every user and runner, theres a story, she said a lot of people say drug addicts and drug dealers are scum of the earth, but they dont know anything about them woods book will open the publics eyes to the raw violence and canniness of the drug world, and the lengths police will go to in order to disrupt it but after years fighting at the apex of the drug war, his conclusion—and that of other experienced officers who have chosen to speak out—must be heeded if we want to find a solution to a problem that has been trashing communities around the world for decades

Article - a new high-tech, controversial law enforcement procedure has some people worried it threatens the privacy of our dna cbs news correspondent anne marie green writes about how she came across this story, and the angie dodge murder investigation, which she reported for 48 hours in the dna of a killer i first learned about the 20-year-old murder of angie dodge in a roundabout way, after getting my dna analyzed by one of those commercial dna databases when i got my results back i was not surprised there were no big revelations and, just as i suspected, i am not related to royalty but i did wonder if i could learn anything more from the dna report that search sent me down a rabbit hole that lead me to the story of michael usry jr, a young filmmaker who became a suspect in the angie dodge murder investigation after getting my dna report i learned that there are a number of genealogy sites, educational institutions and companies that are willing to offer you further insight into what your dna may reveal, as long as you’re willing to upload your dna profile to them some of these sites charge money, while others are simply willing to analyze your dna profile in exchange for adding your profile to their database i probably uploaded my profile to about four sites one told me the type of workout supplements i should be taking, another searched public family trees for family connections there was even one that promised to create a diet tailor made for me based on my dna i gave no thought to how my profile could be used by these companies or institutions down the road then i heard that the new york city police department was trying to get permission to do something called a familial dna search what does that mean?  police hunting for a killer in a high-profile murder case wanted to use his dna to search new york state’s criminal database for a relative of his they had already searched for the killer, but he was not in the database if they could find someone related to him they would have a family name, making it easier to track down the killer  a quick search of the phrase familial dna and i learned authorities in california had used it to apprehend a serial killer, who had eluded them for 25 years the infamous grim sleeper, lonny franklin jr, had a son who was serving time on a felony weapons charge, and his dna had been uploaded to the california criminal database a familial search connected father and son, allowing police to finally make an arrest a little more searching and i stumbled across a blog post about a young filmmaker named, michael usry jr a familial search conducted by idaho falls police landed usry in a stark interrogation room, where he was grilled by detectives and asked for his dna, without any explanation i tracked usry down on facebook and asked him to call me when we finally spoke, he told the whole story how his father had participated in a genealogical study through their church, giving a sample of his dna to a public database, which was later purchased by ancestrycom years later, in an attempt to crack the 20-year-old cold-case murder of angie dodge, police conducted a familial dna search in that very database, and found an anonymous donor who appeared to be a very close match to the killer’s dna after obtaining a search warrant for ancestrycom to reveal his name, detectives learned it was a man named michael usry sr when cops built out his family tree they found usry had a son cops tracked him down and began investigating as i talked with michael usry, he told me he was very angry about being caught up in the investigation, but he was even angrier about something else there was a man serving time for angie’s murder, christopher tapp, who usry believes is innocent after i hung up the phone, i started researching angie dodge’s murder and the case against chris tapp i learned that authorities had never found tapp’s dna at the crime scene tapp was convicted and had at that point served nearly 20 years because of his own words, a confession he made to police i was immediately struck by the fact that michael usry jr and chris tapp had found themselves in similar situations, 20 years apart both men said they knew nothing about the murder of angie dodge , both men had their dna tested and both men did not match that of the killer, yet one man went to prison and the other man went home that was the story i pitched to 48 hours executive producer susan zirinsky chris tapp, serving time for the murder of idaho teen angie dodge, shows cbs news correspondent anne-marie green what his life is like inside the the day both michael usry and i went to see chris tapp in prison, i was struck by how soft spoken and kind tapp was he cried twice that day, once when i asked about the moment in his interrogation when he began to implicate himself in angie’s murder, and a second time when michael usry showed him a video of something that was shot for a documentary usry is making about this case it was an interview with tapp’s wife, lori, who tapp had met and married while in prison in the video, lori spoke of how much she admired her husband and believed in his innocence the interview was conducted shortly before lori was killed in a car crash, and this was the first time tapp had heard her voice since the accident i think there are many lessons in this case, but writing strictly as it relates to the privacy of dna databases, the lesson is this: when you trade your dna for information you are also giving it away -- and the database you give it to, owns it what if that company goes out of business and sells the database? do the protections you have been promised still stand? what if an insurance company wants to know if you carry a specific gene that could increase your chances of getting cancer, or indicates a penchant for risk taking?   right now, the judicial system is playing catch up when it comes to your rights and protections, so we should all be aware and read the fine print there is nothing wrong with wanting to know where you came from and what your genes can tell you about your health; just make sure you know what you are signing up for despite what happened, michael usry’s father does not regret participating in a dna study, but rest assured that his son never will

Article - i n the superman comics there is a character called bizarro, a twisted, villainous inversion of the iconic hero bizarro looks and acts like superman but lives by the exact reverse logic: he says adjectives to mean their opposite, he sees it as a crime to do good, and so on there’s a great seinfeld episode based on the character in today’s age of superhero movie ubiquity, it’s tempting to read 2000’s unbreakable as a bizarro version of everything that proceeded it the basic similarities are all there: a cloaked protagonist with superhuman strength locks horns with a scheming, criminally insane supervillain we see the reluctant hero, played here by bruce willis, come to terms with his powers, use them for civic protection and watch him win the girl before finally overcoming his nemesis we get both characters’ origin stories in flashback, and both are played by hollywood a-listers it’s the preeminent blockbuster blueprint and yet it by no means and exaggeration to say that unbreakable is the exact antithesis of marvel and dc’s current output for starters, it clocks in at 106 minutes and its cast barely extends beyond the four central actors nothing explodes, erupts or is shot at from beginning to end there is no shouting the film is shot and cut with a near-maddening degree of patience, its soundtrack almost noiseless for long spells, and it resorts to eye-catching cgi not once it may be anathema to the box-office behemoths of today, but there’s no doubt that m night shyamalan’s film is a superhero movie in the truest sense nor that, as its camera glides affectionately down the aisles of comic-book stores drinking in vintage illustrations, it shows a genuine passion for the original form that is unmatched by anything that has come since (with the possible exception of sam raimi’s spiderman films) the present glut of cinematic universe-forging comic-book adaptations has born some decent films and some terrible ones, but none can claim to rival the atmosphere and immersion of unbreakable remember the face-clawing tedium that was the final hour of man of steel ? indestructible hero and indestructible villain throwing each other through brick walls ad nauseum, cgi skyscrapers reduced to cgi rubble at a rate of knots, the level of peril remaining at precisely zero throughout unbreakable’s final encounter includes not a single building flattened, not a single punch thrown and lasts all of five minutes instead, we see willis’ david dunn defeat his arch-nemesis by dobbing him in to the authorities it is a scene of understated gravitas, perhaps the most affecting showdown of any modern superhero movie it’s also significant that the other character at the heart of unbreakable is samuel l jackson’s villain six years before he was being driven to high-pitched distraction by those muthafuckin’ snakes on that muthafuckin’ plane, hollywood’s keenest scenery-stealer took to the screen with uncharacteristic restraint as embittered comic-art dealer elijah price, barely raising his voice above a murmur throughout (and his one concession to theatricality, the berating of a customer intending on buying a limited edition print for his kid, works as a nice metaphor for how the film wants to treats its audience like adults) if heath ledger’s joker was so arresting because of his lack of motive, jackson’s cane-clutching baddie chills precisely because his are so plainly stated but while ledger used a manic physicality to unnerve, jackson achieves the same end through the opposite means: his resolutely undemonstrative mr glass is straight from the john doe school of dead-calm supervillainy the scene where he repeatedly sabotages a book store clerk’s attempts to wheel him out of the shop is a more effective, more affecting demonstration of directionless rage than any of the extravagant acts of terrorism enacted by his screen successors while today’s superhero movies aim for excitement via loud action and bloated narratives, unbreakable is deadly quiet, only lightly dusted with plot and told with an everyday realism that verges on mundanity its sole fight sequence is unpleasant and ungainly, actively un-thrilling, shot from a distance in one unbroken take admittedly the film’s slow pacing can seem a bit strained at times, but it’s a directorial style that takes guts to pull off this effectively – and one that’s aged well over a 16-year period in which frenzied spectacle has become the new normal two years after unbreakable was released, raimi’s first spider-man film became the highest grossing film of that year, taking close to half a billion dollars worldwide and effectively igniting the superhero movie boom a decade on, marvel’s list of past and prospective releases stands at 45, while dc having latterly leapt aboard the gravy train between them, these studios are working hard to ensure that the summer blockbuster season remains choc-a-bloc with superhero movies, a trend which shows no sign of letting up these are mediocre times, mrs dunn, jackson tells robin wright’s audrey dunn in unbreakable people are starting to lose hope he didn’t know the half of it published 21 aug 2016

Article - the sea is dark and full of terror well, perhaps not always terror, but certainly mysterious lifeforms, as evidenced by a bizarre purple blob that appeared off the coast of california the other week now, a new bemusing lump of biological matter has appeared near the shores of bunbury, western australia, and it’s safe to say that it caused some fishermen a bit of head-scratching smooth, pink, fleshy, and unbearably smelly, this chunky conundrum simply couldn’t be identified – at least at first mark watkins, a fisherman of 21 years, had clearly never seen anything like it when we got closer we realized it had to be a dead whale because of the smell, he told the west australian its stomach was full of gas so it was all bloated up the stomachs of whales tend to be full of gas during life, but this is normally kept under control floating up to the surface some time after death, the suns rays began to hit the whales abdomen, causing the gases to expand and ultimately forcing the stomach to swell up on occasion, this can cause the cetacean to explode with dramatic, gore-filled fury after drifting away from the carcass, watkins spotted it beginning to deflate it looked like a few sharks had turned up and taken a few bites out of the ex-whale, which had caused its gastrointestinal gas and fluids to flood out into the indian ocean although the exact species of the whale hasn’t been declared, it’s likely to be a humpback or southern right whale, two of the most common types found off the western australian coastline seeing it was great, watkins noted on facebook the smell, not so much clearly, the entire experience was quite over-whale-ming (sorry) a non-deceased humpback whale gudkov andrey/shutterstock

Article - how will humans look 10,000-100,000 years from now? originally appeared on quora: the knowledge sharing network where compelling questions are answered by people with unique insights answer by matan shelomi, organismic and evolutionary biologist, on quora: all life on earth is constantly evolving; the process doesnt stop as living things, humans are still evolving since we became homo sapiens, has evolution changed us in any way? actually, yes thousands of genes have evolved recently (in the last 40,000 years) changes we are seeing include smaller brains (more efficient, not dumber), resistance to diseases, increases in adhd and blue eyes yes, blue eyes genetic analysis says the first blue-eyed human appeared 6,000-10,000 years ago somewhere in the black sea region for whatever reason, the phenotype became very popular (conferring a 5% greater chance for reproduction) and today about half a billion blue-eyed folk exist another famous example is hgbs (sickling hemoglobin), a gene that makes humans immune to malaria malaria is the number one killer of humans, so it makes sense that a mutation eventually arose that makes human red blood cells resistant to the malaria parasites, and for the gene to rise in frequency in malaria-prone populations (sub-saharan africa) unfortunately, the same gene also causes sickle cell anemia we all have two copies of every gene in our body (one from mom, one from dad), and if one copy is the malaria-resistant mutant hgbs, youre fine, but if both are the mutant, you get sickle cell disease the good news is that many other genes confer resistance to malaria, and we are also seeing leprosy and tuberculosis resistance genes appearing, too another example is the gene for lactose tolerance primitive man would drink milk as a baby, and then never again, so the amount of lactase enzyme (which breaks down a common sugar in milk) would fall after a few years of age over time, however, humans have evolved so that certain populations will keep producing the enzyme into late adulthood as expected, the lactose-tolerant trait appears most often in the regions where dairy farming arose first and became an important part of the diet (caucasians) tolerance for milk is supposed to have evolved only 3,000-8,000 years ago, and is now found in nearly 95% of north europeans our mouths are changing, too they are getting smaller and more bullet-shaped our teeth arent quite changing as fast, which is why orthodontics and wisdom teeth removal still exist  for now more and more people are being born without wisdom teeth, or have their wisdom teeth erupt later if at all wisdom teeth were useful before knives and cooking, when humans would probably lose molars to chewing hard food and needed the wisdom teeth as replacements today, 35% of people lack wisdom teeth, although the genes involved in this are unknown so we arent quite sure why this is happening yet darwins theory of natural selection evolves so what will we look like 100,000 years from now, assuming we still exist that far in the future? even if we ignore new technologies, moving off the earth, and various selection pressures, evolution still holds surprises just by chance mutation ten thousand years ago nobody had blue eyes who can guess what evolution has in store for us ten thousand years hence? this question originally appeared on quora ask a question, get a great answer learn from experts and access insider knowledge you can follow quora on twitter, facebook, and google+ more questions:

Article_Title - donald trump takes poll lead over hillary clinton – is it time to panic?
Article - for the first time, republican donald trump seems to have edged ahead of democrat hillary clinton in presidential polling but only just what does it mean and should those opposed to trump be worried? the polling data site realclearpolitics (rcp) takes an average of national polls that ask americans who they would choose in a contest between the two candidates (a scenario that now looks inevitable) on sunday, rcp updated their numbers to show that trump is now, on average, 02 percentage points ahead of clinton that gap might be narrow, but it has still led some (including a senior elections analyst at rcp) to conclude it’s probably time to panic i’d disagree for those concerned about the prospect of a trump victory, it’s been time to panic for a while – zooming out from a single statistic shows it delayed panic? although this might be the first time that trump has come out on top in the rcp polling average, he has come very close to doing so on two prior occasions – in september and december of last year since september, clinton’s lead has fluctuated significantly from being as large as 11 percentage points to as narrow as 06 in other words, there have been many other periods when trump’s opponents should have been worrying before now just as it took pundits a while to wake up to the fact that trump was a sufficiently popular candidate to win the republican nomination, it seems that they have also been slow to switch focus to his chances of winning the white house part of the reason why they didn’t panic before was a belief that measuring american public opinion a long time before a national election is a bad predictor of voting patterns why? because people change their minds november is still six months away the alternative view is that preferences may be becoming hardened now, making voter behavior less likely to shift looking backward, rather than forward, results from the last six presidential elections suggest that 31 states are safe – based on the fact that the same party has consistently won them unsurprisingly, polling companies are investing their time and resources in states they think might swing and therefore determine electoral outcomes nationally – states like arizona, florida, north carolina, ohio and west virginia so far, polling suggests neither candidate has a significant lead in those states which could provide extra cause for concern for those worrying about a trump win polling on a pedestal all that said, the rcp polling average is not the perfect political barometer it is so often held up to be the polling average has become the go-to number for those trying to make quick sense of the state of the presidential race that’s problematic in itself; this election can’t be predicted on the basis of just one number, not least because a candidate’s vote share does not neatly translate to their chances of winning the white house each state wields a different number of electoral votes, so it matters how a candidate’s support is distributed throughout the country democratic victories in highly populous states, which have more electoral votes to award, could cause the performance of the democratic candidate in the electoral college to outstrip her or his performance in the popular vote in 2008, barack obama won 68% of the electoral college vote with only 53% of the popular vote clinton may be buoyed in the 2016 election cycle by traditional democratic strength in populous states such as new york, new jersey, illinois and california there’s another, much bigger problem with the rcp average, though: it’s only as good as the individual polls that make it up rcp always takes a straight average of the five most recent polls that were conducted once you peek under the hood, you’ll see that an average of 02 percentage points flattens out some very different findings these are the five latest polls rcp used to calculate trump’s narrow lead: abc news/washington post: trump leads by 2 percentage points nbc news/wall street journal: clinton leads by 3 percentage points rasmussen reports: trump leads by 5 percentage points fox news: trump leads by 3 percentage points cbs news/new york times: clinton leads by 6 percentage points these polls have different results in part because they use different methodologies for assessing public opinion although they were all conducted during a relatively similar period of time (which is essential when trying to get a snapshot of what the public thinks now), the polls by nbc/wsj and fox news only spoke to registered voters, rasmussen interviewed likely voters, while the abc news/washington post poll simply spoke to adults (82% of whom were registered voters) all polls claim to speak to a nationally representative sample of adults, but virtually none will publish data showing where their respondents were based perhaps rasmussen reports had to adjust their findings to account for the fact that they only managed to speak to two people in iowa – we just don’t know languages matter too two of the polls mentioned above conducted their interviews in spanish and english – it seems that the others did not methodologies matter they’re one reason why the footnotes in each poll mention slightly different degrees of accuracy take the abc news/washington post poll for example – those numbers have a margin of error of +/- 35 percentage points that means that trump’s reported lead of 2 percentage points could have actually been as high as 55 percentage points or it could be that hillary clinton actually led by 15 percentage points polling is far from perfect to understand what will happen when the country votes this november, pundits would do better to look at the electoral map, demographics and – most importantly of all – listen to the concerns of voters

Article_Title - whale ear wax reveals animals exposure to stress & toxins, scientists say
Article - wax inside a whale’s ear stores all sorts of useful information on the animal’s exposure to pollutants and stress levels throughout life, researchers have found the team, led by sascha usenko, a environmental scientist at baylor university in waco, texas, extracted an earplug from a blue whale (balaenoptera musculus) killed in a collision with a ship off the coast of santa barbara, california, in 2007 and found it had come into contact with several organic pollutants and contained high levels of the stress hormone cortisol as it reached sexual maturity it’s difficult to recover time-specific information on chemical exposure for almost any animal, says stephen trumble, a biologist also at baylor and a co-author of the study, published in proceedings of the national academy of sciences this week that is especially true of the relatively rare blue whale, the world’s largest inhabitant decimated by historic whaling practices, blue whales number just 5,000–12,000 individuals worldwide, and they are threatened by entanglement in fishing nets, environmental noise and pollution scientists have long used whale blubber as a record of the chemicals that these enormous creatures absorb as they traverse the ocean but analysis of blubber does not indicate when chemical contamination occurred, or how long it lasted the whale earplug from a blue whale that was used in the study whale earwax is a fat-rich deposit that stores the same chemical data as blubber but it also records time — similarly to the rings of a tree, the wax is laid down in light and dark bands, with each band correlating roughly to a six-month period in baleen, or filter-feeding, whales, earwax forms a solid plug that may be tens of centimetres long and remains intact even after its death chemical signatures usenko and his team identified their specimen as a male aged about 12 years during his brief life he came into contact with 16 persistent organic pollutants, including pesticides and flame retardants exposure to the most persistent chemicals was greatest in the first year — and accounted for one-fifth of his total lifetime contact — suggesting a transfer of contaminants from his mother in the womb and during nursing maternal transfer of pollutants is known to happen in other mammals, such as seals and humans once these compounds enter the food chain, they are passed on and accumulate some of these chemicals are no longer in use, such as flame retardants that were outlawed in 2005, but they can stick around for 50 or 60 years, says usenko other toxins uncovered from the earwax were probably picked up along the way mercury — which can cause brain damage — spiked twice in the sample, at around five and ten years over the whale’s life, concentrations of cortisol, a stress hormone, doubled the peak was directly after the whale reached sexual maturity, at about ten years old, suggesting stress from sexual competition but it is unclear whether the overall increase was caused by natural events, such as weaning, or by human activities, such as pollution and noise the research is exciting, says jeremy goldbogen, a marine biologist at cascadia research collective in olympia, washington, but the inability to distinguish baseline stress levels from those associated with anthropogenic disturbances is a limitation of the study the male blue whale whose earplug was harvested for the study (michelle berman-kowalewskic, phd, santa barbara museum of natural history, santa barbara, calif) usenko and his team are now hoping to investigate that question by analysing some of the 1,000 or more whale specimens in museums worldwide if we can look at individuals that lived in an environment without some of the stresses we see now, then we could tease out the causes of the cortisol increase, he says this story originally appeared in nature news

Article - will s for most, the love of books starts in childhood for others, this love blooms later, eventually revealing the vibrant colors of a true bibliophile! but science has started looking into the effects of reading on the brain they’ve done experiments, ran mris, polled, and surveyed, all to what end? studies have been released in the past several years that have given scientists some interesting data about fiction readers and what type of fiction they should read! what has science concluded? studies are showing that readers of fiction are more empathetic towards others by engaging with a story, readers are temporarily placing themselves in a character’s shoes, therefore, the more stories you read, the more shoes you’ve tried on it’s a fascinating insight into the world of reading in 2012, standford university did research into why this is according to neuroscientist bob dougherty, the right patterns of ink on a page can create vivid mental imagery and instill powerful emotions your brain does amazing things while you’re reading, the breadth of which researchers are still defining and by placing yourself into the world of a great novel, you are given the chance to experience something new that could be informative in your interactions with other people this compassion was notably detected in children reading harry potter another experiment conducted three studies to test whether extended contact through reading the popular best-selling books of harry potter improves attitudes toward stigmatized groups (immigrants, homosexuals, refugees) the conclusion of the study was that children who identified with harry as a character reacted to his sympathy for marginalized groups (such as mudbloods) by becoming more sympathetic towards similar groups in contemporary society (such as the lgbt and immigrant communities) but this was only shown after these connections were explicated to the children and only if they identified with harry what does this all mean? sure, we create images in our heads of the stories we read –we engage with language, we sympathize with the characters in our books– but besides harry potter, which books should we be reading to maximize these cognitive benefits? the authors of another study, david comer kidd and emanuele castano, tackled this question, but also asserted that what you choose read is important! as castano explained to miccom: we believe that one critical difference between lit and pop fiction is the extent to which the characters are complex, ambiguous, difficult to get to know, etc (in other words, human) versus stereotyped, simple through their research, they found that readers of literary fiction receive more of the empathetic benefits of reading than those who read pop-fiction or non-fiction the term literary fiction seems arbitrary, but kidd and castano explain that literary fiction merely denotes the level of complexity in stories and their characters (at least, that’s what it means in the context of their study) in 50 shades of grey, for example, the characters are laid out they react to each other and to their environment by no means are these characters simple or easy, but they do not evoke the same complicated and uncanny feelings that one experiences with nick carraway as he narrates the great gatsby reading in general helps with empathy, but literary reading amplifies this effect by reading a challenging book, you’re not only becoming a smarter person, you’re also become more empathetic literature is not always easy, but by attempting to tackle harder books, we create new connections in our minds that we might not have otherwise like opening a window to let fresh air into your home, literature opens up our minds to the myriad ideas that we wouldn’t be able to experience on our own! so after you finish your magazine or paperback thriller, reflect on its contents take a moment to analyze the experiences depicted as if they were your own and in choosing your next book, make it a tough one your brain will thank you which book inspires you the most?

Article - so the other day, i was scrolling through my timeline and came across a tweet commenting on some of the trendier rappers in hip hop right now the tweet, which i’ll paraphrase, said that people who listen to rappers like kodak black, migos, young thug, future, fetty wap, and lil yachty are people who subsequently have low iqs this isn’t exactly an unfamiliar comment that can be found online i’ve seen tweets before that have told me that i’m stupid for listening to more fetty wap songs than tupac songs in the past year i’m not a real hip hop fan, apparently there are a couple points i want to get to about these sorts of popular, conformist opinions first of all, the digital era and internet presence of hip hop has made the genre as inclusive a community as i’ve ever seen it chance the rapper made free (based freestyles mixtape) with lil b mac miller has a song with chief keef on his last album, go:od am andre 3000 dropped a lengthy verse on sixteen, a song off of rick ross’ god forgives, i don’t what haven’t 2 chainz and thugger not been featured on this decade? rappers with completely different styles and interpretations of hip hop are frequently working together these days your favorite, thoughtful, wordy rapper could put out a song with your least favorite, struggle-bar spitting rapper it’s only a matter of time before it happens (unless it already has) so if a rapper like danny brown wants to hop on the remix for sd’s new world order (as he did), does that mean that danny brown has a low iq? or even, does sd have a low iq for rapping repetitive and simplistic lyrics in a sub-genre of rap (drill) that almost depends on recycling lyrics/themes? the answer to both questions is no therefore, it doesn’t matter if someone’s favorite rapper is kodak black or kendrick lamar—it doesn’t in any way reflect someone’s intelligence now, i can’t really speak on the actual iq numbers of the people i know, but i can say with confidence that i know a lot of very intelligent people who like rappers who aren’t considered lyrical rappers my sister, who does have a gifted-level iq, has become a big future fan one of my college roommates frequently listens to migos, and he will be attending law school next fall my girlfriend, who is an award-winning writer, and who could run laps around most people with her expert grasp of language, gets hype to flocka like none other my favorite hip hop project of the year (if i’m not considering the force that is death grips’ bottomless pit a rap album, which i’m not) is lil yachty’s lil boat mixtape, and i just graduated from my liberal arts college with departmental honors and i think minnesota (remix), which ironically features quavo of migos and young thug, is one of the most fun hip hop songs i’ve heard all year people with any level of intelligence are free to like any kind of music they want to what’s wrong with putting kodak black’s skrt and kendrick lamar’s the art of peer pressure on the same playlist? in fact, there’s nothing wrong with liking both kodak black and kendrick lamar speaking of kendrick lamar, i have a friend who told me once that machine gun kelly was a better artist than kendrick sure, i cringed and adamantly disagreed, but ultimately it didn’t make a difference what i thought it’s never cool to make someone feel bad for what they like or love, even if the music they like might be unpopular, weird, or bad to you it’s twice as lame to post on social media how terrible certain rappers are (rappers who could care less about the opinions of fans who they aren’t trying to attract anyway) and even worse to trash the innocent fans of these rappers there will always be pretentiousness when it comes to any kind of art i’m guilty of it as much as i’m sure a lot of people are but opinions on hip hop are subjective it’s important to be open-minded there are so many unique sub-genres of rap that are waiting to be explored that may not rely on lyrics, poetry, or message as much as maybe the sound, vocal delivery, or overall aesthetic there’s a reason common isn’t ever requested at the bar i don’t hear a tribe called quest during warmups for big basketball games how does one dance to an immortal technique song? hip hop needs guys that make music with energy hip hop needs rappers who allow us to tune out their words and just feel their music hip hop fans don’t need to feel pressured to only listen to music that is considered smart smart isn’t everything, and just because a song is intellectually smart, doesn’t necessarily mean it is enjoyable to listen to people have different tastes a person’s music taste indicates nothing conclusive about a person’s brain power so stop hating, throw on some lil yachty, and don’t be afraid to like it

Article - there’s an old saying in neuroscience: neurons that fire together wire together this means the more you run a neuro-circuit in your brain, the stronger that circuit becomes this is why, to quote another old saw, practice makes perfect the more you practice piano, or speaking a language, or juggling , the stronger those circuits get the ability to learn is about more than building and strengthening neural connections for years this has been the focus for learning new things but as it turns out, the ability to learn is about more than building and strengthening neural connections even more important is our ability to break down the old ones it’s called synaptic pruning here’s how it works your brain’s delete button and how to use it imagine your brain is a garden, except instead of growing flowers, fruits, and vegetables, you grow synaptic connections between neurons these are the connections that neurotransmitters like dopamine, seratonin, and others travel across glial cells are the gardeners of your brain–they act to speed up signals between certain neurons but other glial cells are the waste removers, pulling up weeds, killing pests, raking up dead leaves your brain’s pruning gardeners are called microglial cells they prune your synaptic connections the question is, how do they know which ones to prune? researchers are just starting to unravel this mystery, but what they do know is the synaptic connections that get used less get marked by a protein, c1q (as well as others) when the microglial cells detect that mark, they bond to the protein and destroy–or prune–the synapse this is how your brain makes the physical space for you to build new and stronger connections so you can learn more have you ever felt like your brain is full? maybe when starting a new job, or deep in a project you’re not sleeping enough, even though you’re constantly taking in new information well, in a way, your brain actually is full when you learn lots of new things, your brain builds connections, but they’re inefficient, ad hoc connections your brain needs to prune a lot of those connections away and build more streamlined, efficient pathways it does that when we sleep

Article_Title - what would happen if the olympics banned russia?
Article - imagine the most stereotypically russian way an olympic doping scandal could play out are you thinking sketchy fsb agents? passing urine samples back and forth through a hole in a wall  hidden behind a cabinet in a laboratory? and everything kinda sorta maybe ties back to putin? because then you’d be absolutely right this morning, the court of arbitration for sport made a ruling on russia’s cartoonish state-sponsored skullduggery, which has been going on since 2010: it upheld the international association of athletic federations’ ban on russian track and field athletes in the rio olympics, whether there’s hard evidence they were juicing or not the international olympics committee is still making up its mind about that ban, but it’s also still possible it will ban the country altogether—a decision that would affect not just the medal counts in rio, but the state of international athletics marcus noland, executive vice president and director of studies at the peterson institute for international economics, builds models that forecast medal counts based on past performance, population, gdp, and other variables in london, the russians won four to 16 more medals than his models predicted—meaning their wins were probably inflated by doping and his numbers have been borne out: the olympic committee has since reallocated 11 russian medals from the london games if the russians competed in rio cleanly (or, as noland says, no dirtier than average), his models suggest they’re good for 66 or 67 medals so how many more would he expect if doping went on unchecked? if they managed to nab 11 extra medals in london, when their doping program was still relatively new, you can bet they could get at least that number and then some noland figures the russians would have come away with about 80 medals if the ioc does ban russia, that’s enough medals to throw any olympic predictions seriously out of whack and many of the medals that might have otherwise gone to russian athletes would likely go to competitors from the us, as they did at the 1984 los angeles olympics that the soviet union boycotted: in the absence of the ussr, the us’s total medal count skyrocketed to 174, and fell to 94 when the soviets returned to the olympics in 1988 for the olympic movement, it’s a huge deal, says david wallechinsky, the president of the international society of olympic historians this isn’t tonga or paraguay, it’s one of three big medal winners for the average american olympics viewer, the absence of russian athletes might go unnoticed where it most certainly will be noticed, of course, is russia you cannot separate the olympics from politics, says wallechinsky that’s a myth russia is already saying this a western plot countries have been banned from the olympics before, but it’s always been for overtly political reasons germany and japan were not on the olympic guest list for the 1948 summer olympics, south africa was banned during the apartheid era, and afghanistan was banned in 2000 the potential russian ban wouldn’t be that much of a departure from those decisions, because olympic athletes’ doping is inherently political if doping is done for the glory of the nation state, even if the athlete is doing it in secret with just an internet connection and a po box, it can take on an element of politics, says john gleaves, co-director of the international network of humanistic doping research and state-sponsored doping is the same, but, you know, more so one of the reasons that doping has remained such a problem at the olympics is that the whole process is completely byzantine, and countries are left to police themselves the anti-doping setup had led to a really lumpy enforcement, says gleaves how much anti-doping work can kenya be expected to do when you look at its ranking in gdp? the russian doping scandal puts a spotlight on a problem that was already systemic in international sports which may very well drive the ioc to be a stickler for the sake of its integrity and credibility the ioc is trying to hitch its wagon to environmental sustainability, wider participation in sport, sensible urban planning, and clean sport—and failed on all those accounts, says the games: a global history of the olympics  he puts on his best john goodman: ‘i’m talking about drawing a line in the sand, dude which may very well drive the ioc to be a stickler for the sake of its integrity and credibility the ioc is trying to hitch its wagon to environmental sustainability, wider participation in sport, sensible urban planning, and clean sport—and failed on all those accounts, says david goldblatt , author ofthe games: a global history of the olympics he puts on his best john goodman: ‘i’m talking about drawing a line in the sand, dude and this scandal seems an appropriate place for the ioc to draw that line look at what happened to east german athletes in the 1970s at the nadir, doping accounted for 17 percent of the medals won in women’s competitions, says noland there was no informed consent you now have high rates of birth defects amongst east german athletes the stuff they gave them had incredible, multi-generational physiological damage i regard this as really evil whether you think that doping is inherently bad or the future of athletic excellence, state-sponsored doping is not in the spirit of the games

Article_Title - keeping legal drinking age at 21 saves 900 lives yearly: study
Article - laws that maintain the legal drinking age at 21 save lives on the road, and protect young people from other hazards of drinking, according to a new review of studies researchers examined the evidence from studies conducted since 2006, and found that laws that make it illegal for people under age 21 to drink are linked to lower rates of drunk-driving deaths among young people researchers also found that current drinking restrictions have not resulted in more binge drinking among teens, as some have suggested recent research has reinforced the position that the current law has served the nation well by reducing alcohol-related traffic crashes and alcohol consumption among youths, the researchers wrote in their study published today (feb 24) in the journal of studies on alcohol and drugs the evidence is clear that there would be consequences if we lowered the legal drinking age, said study researcher william dejong of boston university school of public health [7 ways alcohol affects your health] us states may differ on the details of their laws regarding possessing alcohol, adult supervision of drinking, or drinking at home, but all 50 states have maintained a minimum drinking age of 21 since at least 1988 the benefits of these laws, however, continue to be debated advocates for lowering the minimum legal drinking age argue that the laws have not stopped teenagers from drinking, and in fact contribute to binge drinking behind closed doors and in places with no adult supervision they also argue that the current laws havent led to fewer traffic accidents caused by alcohol consumption however, the new review found that since the legal drinking age was set at 21, young people have been drinking less, and are less likely to get into traffic accidents in fact, the age 21 laws have saved up to 900 lives yearly on the road, according to estimates from the national highway transportation safety administration teen drinking and driving rates have dropped by 54 percent over the last two decades, and the biggest declines were seen between 1982 and 1995, a period which included changes in the federal law that pushed all states to increase their drinking age to 21 during that period, the number of fatally-injured drunk drivers decreased by 57 percent among those ages 16 to 20, compared with 39 percent for those ages 21 to 24, and 9 percent for those older than 25 looking at whether setting the age at 21 has driven teenagers to drink more, researchers found that psychological and social studies on drinking motivations have not supported this idea on the other hand, many studies have found that a higher legal drinking age led to less alcohol consumption in one of the most recent studies, researchers found that in 2011, 36 percent of college students said theyd engaged in binge drinking in the past two weeks, compared with 43 percent of students in 1988, the first year that the age 21 law was adopted by all states researchers noted the age 21 law has had positive effects despite being sometimes disobeyed, and indifferently enforced instead of lowering drinking age, there should be in fact stricter enforcement of the law, they said clinical trials have found that when college towns put more effort into enforcing the law — and advertise that fact to students — student drinking declines, dejong said some people assume that students are so hell-bent on drinking, nothing can stop them, dejong said but it really is the case that enforcement works

Article - it is the age-old method for cooking brussels sprouts, handed down the generations and put into practice at least once a year but it now seems that by cutting a small cross in the base of each sprout all this time, we have all simply been doing it wrongly and instead of boiling them, we should be steaming, stir-frying or even microwaving brussels to get that perfectly crunchy consistency britain’s top sprout expert has urged the nation’s cooks to reconsider their approach to the christmas staple whose fortunes are starting to be revived matthew rawson, chairman of the brassica growers association, said: boiling them was traditionally the way of doing it, but putting the cross in puts in too much water they turn soggy and rubbish people who do that have ruined the brussels sprout mr rawson, who farms in yorkshire, added: people now are learning that it is a very versatile vegetable the big ones lend themselves well to a stir-fry people are steaming them, and there are fancy microwave packs it is being driven forward by people who are more creative he credits the new vogue for dishes such as brussels sprouts with pancetta and chestnuts or pistachio and pomegranate sprout salad with revitalising the vegetable’s fortunes brussels sprouts have moved away from the poor little malign christmas sprout image, and it has seen demand increase, he said it’s happened over the last decade certainly people do eat more of them – there are a lot more foody programmes on television and foody magazines, and it is there in their subconscious the sprout farmer has teamed up with aaron craze, a youtube cooking star, to set up the website loveyourgreenscouk and to promote the wonders of his beloved brassicas the reality was that people who were eating our products were the older generation, and the older generation keep dying so we had to link in with younger generations and mothers, said mr rawson  it was just another way of experimenting with our product nicola knight, an analyst at horizons, which provides information on the food sector, said sprouts are now seen as a more versatile winter ingredient than just a traditional festive accompaniment   she said: following on from the recent rise in popularity of spinach and kale, brussels appear to be the latest vegetable to benefit from growing awareness of the health benefits of leafy greens  we are now seeing them used in soups and salads, and as a topping for burgers and pizza brussels on pizza? now that’s surely a step too far

Article_Title - can linux ever beat windows at pc gaming?
Article - can linux ever beat windows at pc gaming? windows has long been the undisputed king of computer operating systems when it comes to gaming but is linux getting to the point where it can take on windows in pc gaming? a writer at techradar remains quite skeptical about the possibility of linux someday becoming the top gaming operating system for pcs game carey reports for techradar: evidently, windows isn’t going anywhere, with a steam market share of nearly 96% as of march 2016 in fact, epic games even recently called microsoft out on trying to monopolize pc gaming with its universal windows platform initiatives although microsoft has lost sight of what pc gamers want in recent years (see: games for windows live), there’s no doubt that the current xbox head phil spencer wants to bring the company back to its roots, namely by integrating features (and games) from the xbox one into windows 10 in contrast, valve’s attempts at making linux not only the best place to play games from your steam library, but actually the heart of your living room are tough to jive with despite making an effort with steamos, it doesn’t help that a number of companies still haven’t released their november 2015-bound steam machines after neglecting to comply with the operating system’s handicaps there’s a clear winner here, and unless linux rectifies its performance disparity, lack of natively supported control options and impoverished game library, the os to beat for pc gaming will remain windows 10 more at techradar distrowatch reviews freebsd 103’s new features jesse smith at distrowatch did a full review of freebsd 100 a while back, and now he has some thoughts to share about the new features that have been added to the recently released freebsd 103 jesse smith reports for distrowatch: freebsd is a venerable operating system, often deployed on servers due to the project’s focus on performance and stability at the beginning of april the freebsd project released version 103 of their operating system the release announcement for freebsd 103 mentioned several features and improvements which caught my attention specifically the availability of zfs boot environments, 64-bit linux compatibility and jail improvements were of interest to me i was especially eager to try out freebsd’s new jails technology using the iocage front-end the iocage software has been presented as an improvement on (and replacement for) warden, a friendly front-end for handling jail environments one of the first things i wanted to do was experiment with boot environments for those who have not used them before, a boot environment is basically a snapshot of our operating system before performing any major configuration change or software upgrade we can take a snapshot of the operating system this gives us a point in time when we knew the operating system was working we then perform any changes or upgrades we want when we boot the system we can choose, from the boot menu, which snapshot we want to use this allows us to effectively move backward in time and boot older copies of the system this makes the operating system virtually bullet proof as almost any change (short of hardware failure) can be fixed by simply rebooting and selecting to boot an older copy of the operating system the pc-bsd and opensuse projects have used boot environments successfully for some time now, but the technology has not widely caught on elsewhere the next item on my list of things to try was 64-bit linux compatibility freebsd has a compatibility layer which allows the operating system to run linux executables there are some restrictions though for example, up until now the linux executable had to be compiled for 32-bit systems and any dependencies had to be copied into place manually there is a package in the freebsd repository which installs the centos core userland software in essence, this gives us a bare bones installation of centos 6 in a directory on our freebsd computer this is handy if we need to run linux software alongside freebsd software or if we want to run linux software without the resource overhead of a full featured virtual machine the final feature i wanted to look at was freebsd jails, specifically the way the iocage software works and how it compares to the older warden jail management software jails on freebsd are basically very lightweight virtual machines part of the file system is roped off and processes can run in this area (jail) without knowing about or being able to affect the rest of the system what primarily separates jails from virtual machines is jails all share the host’s kernel, meaning jailed processes must be able to run on our version of freebsd in recent years docker has provided similar functionality on linux more at distrowatch linus torvalds releases linux kernel 46 linus has been very busy working on the next release of the linux kernel, and now linux 46 has been released into the wild simon sharwood reports on whats new in linux kernel 46 for the register: new this time around is support for a bunch more arm systems-on-a-chip, including qualcomm’s snapdragon 820 ibm’s power9 finds its first support, although perhaps prematurely given the silicon won’t arrive until late 2016 whatever cpu you use to run linux, it can now have a more complex conversation about when to vary its frequency, orangefs, xfs, btrfs and ext 4 users can all look for tweaks that enhance performance of their preferred file systems, while f2fs is now said to be rather better at running on flash storage dell’s laptops will play nicer with linux thanks to driver changes that permit hotkeys to be pressed into service raspberry pi users may appreciate new drivers that are said to do lovely

Article_Title - is buying organic really worth it?
Article - buying organic food typically involves shelling out a premium but is the extra pinch to the pocket actually worth it? last week, a department of agriculture report revealed just how much it really costs to shop organic organic eggs, milk and salad greens can cost upwards of 60 percent more than conventional alternatives, while items like apples, carrots, granola and spinach carry premiums of between 7 and 30 percent, the study said producing organic food tends to be costlier along every part of the supply chain -- including farming practices that usually require greater labor inputs and segregating organic ingredients from conventional ones though there may be logical reasons for the heftier price tag, does it really make sense as a consumer to pay more for organic food? the answer, it turns out, is anything but straightforward here, we explore this hotly contested issue what the heck does organic mean anyway? organic produce, according to the usda, must be grown without synthetic pesticides, synthetic fertilizers or genetically modified organisms organic meat has to come from animals that were raised in a natural setting, didnt receive any antibiotics or hormones, and were fed 100 percent organic feed by this general definition, [organic food] should be friendlier to the planet and pose less harm to human health, chensheng lu, an associate professor of environmental exposure biology at harvard university, told the huffington post over email when it comes to packaged foods, only a label that says 100 percent organic indicates a product made solely with organic ingredients organic, on the other hand, means 95 percent of the ingredients are organic, while made with organic ingredients is reserved for products with at least 70 percent certified organic ingredients there’s skepticism among consumers, however, about the trustworthiness of organic labels last year, a study by market research firm mintel found that a majority of american consumers think organic labeling is merely an excuse to charge more indeed, there’s some evidence that organic labels may not always be reliable a major issue, experts say, is a lack of a robust monitoring system to keep track of whether products that say theyre organic really are still, despite a flawed system, there do appear to be measurable differences between foods labeled organic and those that are not a 2012 meta-analysis published in the annals of internal medicine comparing organic and conventional foods, for example, found that exposure to pesticide residue was more than five times higher in conventional produce a 2014 study found that organic foods had significantly lower levels of toxic metals compared to conventional alternatives, and substantially higher levels of antioxidants so, what does this mean for human health? according to the environmental working group, nearly three-quarters of 7,000 produce samples tested by the usda in 2014 contained pesticide residues in some cases, these pesticides persisted on fruits and vegetables even when they were washed or peeled pesticide exposure has been linked to all kinds of health conditions, from neurodegenerative diseases like parkinsons to cancer and birth defects the jury, however, is still out as to whether or not the pesticides found in conventional foods are present in large enough quantities to actually make a difference to human health in the 2012 meta-analysis, conventional fruits and vegetables were found to have far more pesticide residue than organic produce, but the levels were almost always under the maximum amount allowed by the environmental protection agency we’re exposed to a cocktail of chemicals from our food on a daily basis, said michael crupain, the director of consumer reports’ food safety and sustainability center, in an earlier post it’s not realistic to expect we wouldn’t have any pesticides in our bodies in this day and age, but that would be the ideal we just don’t know enough about the health effects some organic food skeptics have also pointed out that non-synthetic pesticides are used on some organic farms as well -- and the science is still hazy as to whether or not those compounds have ill effects when it comes to the nutritional value of organic food, theres also conflicting data the 2012 meta-analysis did not find any significant nutritional differences between conventional and organic foods a meta-analysis published two years later in the british journal of nutrition, however, found that organic produce may have substantially higher concentrations of antioxidants and other potentially beneficial compounds a recent study, published in february, concluded that organic dairy and meat contain about 50 percent more omega-3 fatty acids omega-3s are linked to reductions in cardiovascular disease, improved neurological development and function, and better immune function, wrote study co-author chris seal, a professor of food and human nutrition at the uk’s newcastle university but getting enough in our diet is difficult our study suggests that switching to organic would go some way towards improving intakes of these important nutrients as for antibiotic use in food animals, the problems are more clear-cut the centers for disease control notes that [s]cientists around the world have provided strong evidence that antibiotic use in food-producing animals can have a negative impact on public health because the drugs allow antibiotic-resistant bacteria to develop so choosing organic meat, or meat raised without antibiotics, is better than conventional when it comes to this issue other ways of measuring worth: when considering the benefits of organic food, it can be tempting to focus on the impacts of such products on human health but as marion nestle, author of food politics and professor of nutrition at new york university, noted, choosing organic has implications for the earth’s well-being, too when done well, more work goes into producing organically, and organic methods are demonstrably better for soil and sustainability, she told huffpost organics are about production values those values are important to me according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations, an agency dedicated to addressing world hunger, there are many environmental benefits of organic agriculture, including long-term sustainability, greater biodiversity and better soil health but organic farming still isnt perfect one meta-analysis found that though organic farming practices had fewer environmental impacts per acre, this was not necessarily true per product unit though the health impacts of conventional foods on consumers remain unclear, the detrimental effects of pesticides and other chemicals are more clearly documented in the case of farmworkers theres also some evidence that people living in farm communities are at risk for chronic health problems as a result of chemical exposure pesticides used in strawberry farms in california, for instance, are associated with an increased cancer risk among children living in those areas, according to the department of pesticide regulation lu said choosing organic can also have positive impacts on the food industry at large promoting organic agriculture will attract a new cohort of farmers who believes in producing healthier and safer foods, he said it’s [also] good for the economy, by eliminating the corporative monopoly according to food and water watch, economic power in the agriculture and food sector is unusually concentrated the four largest companies, for instance, control 85 percent of soybean processing and 82 percent of the beef packing industry -- an oligopolistic situation that’s economically harmful for both farmers and consumers communities with more medium- and smaller-sized farms have more shared prosperity, including higher incomes, lower unemployment and lower income inequality, than communities with larger farms tied to often-distant agribusinesses, the nonprofit writes many organic farms are small operations, though big organic farms do exist as well if buying from a small farm is important to you, one option is to seek out a local farmers market, where youre often able to speak directly with a person who helped grow your produce organic on a budget regularly purchasing organic products may simply not be financially feasible for many consumers, so nestle suggests to just buy organic to the extent you can, when you can and there are ways to do it on the cheap (or at least, more cheaply): 1 prioritize your purchases it is most important for young children, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems to eat organic food, advised deborah gerszberg, a nutritionist at columbia university’s pancreas center, in a blog post she also recommends buying organic animal products, including eggs and milk, as often as possible some companies aren’t certified organic, but still pledge not to use hormones or unnecessary antibiotics this would be a good second choice, she said choosing organic options for things that you or your household eat in large quantities is also a recommended practice the repetitive intakes of pesticides from foods could cause more harm to your health than sporadic exposure, said lu for produce, buy organic if youre planning to eat the skin of the fruit or vegetable choose organic for the foods containing the highest amount of chemical residue, and choose conventional foods for foods with the least residue, said gerszberg the environmental working groups dirty dozen and clean fifteen lists are helpful resources on this front the first highlights conventional produce with the highest pesticide loads (such as strawberries, apples, nectarines, grapes and spinach) the clean list, on the other hand, catalogs produce least likely to hold pesticide residues these include avocados, sweet corn, pineapples, cabbage and cauliflower 2 buy in season (and local, if possible) buying organic produce in season tends to be much kinder on the wallet in addition visiting a farmers market, you could try purchasing a crop share or csa (community supported agriculture) to get local, in-season produce locally grown food is often fresher and tastier than the alternative the crops are picked at their peak, and farmstead products like cheeses and are hand-crafted for best flavor, writes vern grubinger, a vegetable and berry specialist at the university of vermont livestock products are processed in nearby facilities, and typically the farmer has direct relationship with processors, overseeing quality -- unlike animals processed in large industrial facilities buying local food is a community investment, grubinger adds -- a way to not just support local businesses, but also to protect local ecosystems and help communities become more self-sufficient it also supports a more sustainable food system by significantly minimizing the use of fossil fuel-based transportation its estimated that the average american meal travels about 1,500 miles to get from farm to plate, according to the center for urban education about sustainable agriculture in contrast, locally sourced food can travel 200 miles or less 3 buying generic and in bulk are money-savers too many mainstream supermarkets, including safeway, target, wal-mart and h-e-b, carry organic store-brand options, while costco, sams club and bjs sell organic foodstuffs in bulk some supermarkets, like whole foods, also have bulk bins stocked with organic grains, dried fruit, coffee and other products 4 keep an eye out for sales and coupons sites like all natural savings and organic deals can help customers surface organic food deals 5 grow your own food it might sound daunting, but growing your own produce isnt as difficult as it sounds it just requires a bit of effort and patience good housekeeping has some tips on how to start your own organic garden live in a small apartment? the urban organic gardener websites got you covered the bottom line so is buying organic worth it? depending on your priorities, it might be ultimately, many experts agree that eating a balanced diet, while remaining conscientious about how your food choices impact the health of the planet and

sunshine, so measuring it gets tricky they go on, however, to state that colorado only has 30-40 overcast days per year, leaving at least 300 days of partial sunshine they estimate only about 115 days that would fit the classic definition of clear but 300 days of partial sunshine, at the least, still sounds awesome 2 being at a high altitude just makes things more fun colorado has the highest average elevation in the country the lowest point in colorado, located at the arikaree river, is 3,315 feet above sea level the highest is mt elbert, located at 14,433 feet above sea level denver, the

try loveland pass for steep climbs, hairpin turns and views that will make both your stomach and jaw drop 9 travel back in time and visit gold rush and mining towns these cool little old-school mining towns look like theyre out of a movie (or snow white, maybe?) most people associate the gold rush with california, but lets not forget pikes peak and colorados role in the fun follow the colorado gold trail and pass through gold and silver mine towns like idaho springs, breckenridge and black hawk mine tours are also available in many towns as well 10 denvers homegrown burger chain, smashburger, is beyond delicious while its up for debate where the original smashburger came from, smashburger as we know it today is denver born and bred denver is also home to the first ever chipotle which is

living wont leave you totally broke denver is also near plenty of outdoor adventure, so urbanites can escape from the city whenever their hearts desire 14 and boulder is a haven for crunchy types with no shortage of activity, and awesome proximity to nature, of course 15 because you can walk into a recreational marijuana dispensary and buy marijuana, legally both in-state residents and visitors

more if you fancy yourself a consumer of marijuana, you will be in heaven keep in mind, you can only smoke in private, buy from licensed dispensaries and cannot bring marijuana products out of the

Article_Title - you can be mentally stronger if you do this small act every day
Article - as humans, we tend to set goals throughout our entire lives and dedicate most of our time trying to achieve them that gives us purpose and motivation to strive forward yet, it can have detrimental consequences to our mental health, activating stress indicators that come as a byproduct of pushing ourselves too hard towards massive goals as psychologist karl weick suggests in his article small wins, we should make it an everyday practice to focus our attention towards the positive by counting each small win we make by taking the alcoholics anonymous as an example, he suggests that the principle works due to the change in perspective instead of focusing on overwhelming and complex goals, participants are encouraged to choose small, achievable daily actions: the impossibility of lifetime abstinence is scaled down to the more workable task of not taking a drink for the next 24 hours, drastically reducing the size of a win necessary to maintain sobriety by celebrating these small, daily wins, participants feel more confident and motivated to achieve the same satisfactory feeling the next day, and so the behavior gains momentum leading to an almost effortless achievement of the ultimate goal the dangers of dreaming big we are encouraged on a daily basis to dream big and set our bars high if we want to achieve great things this phrase is an inescapable part of every motivational speech by almost every successful person who ever lived there is nothing wrong in the saying itself, yet it tends to be misinterpreted by us, the regular mortals who are fascinated by fairy tale stories of dreams that come true to those who are brave enough to wish and focus on the ultimate goal for every great achievement ever made, there have been a million of small wins and breakthroughs that gradually led there, and this is something many people tend to overlook when working on achieving their goals if we forget to appreciate the small wins we regularly make, the following negative consequences will appear: our sense of self-worth can be worsened we risk feeling bad about ourselves and feeling incompetent when we constantly compare present state to our final goals, which can only lessen our chances of making progress we are prone to the feeling of failure and depression when our goals can’t be achieved the increased amount of stress we have to cope with when we work on getting it all and now is counterproductive, as it blocks our productivity and weakens our physical health once we change the perspective from big to small and break our final goal into smaller, achievable chunks, we take the pressure off and avoid the risks to our health by focusing on everyday progress, we automatically feel much more motivated, which causes our brain to get hooked on the positive rush and the feeling of accomplishment striving to achieve more understanding the importance of small wins and knowing how to apply it to your everyday life will cause tremendous benefits to your goal achieving and your overall health here is the 4-step process you can take to develop the habit of celebrating small wins: step 1: start small first of all, you need to write down your final goal, and forget about it it sounds silly, but this will help you focus on the fragments ahead of you, which is the only way to get things done instead of wasting energy on planning months ahead, focus on the next day’s challenges only be here and now and only think one step ahead in order to move forward this will give you the constant sense of accomplishment, which will motivate you to move forward and boost your self-esteem step 2: reflect often every once in a while, take some time to reflect on your progress so often we focus on goals yet to be accomplished and forget about the progress that has already taken place this means comparing yourself — with yourself for example, if your goal is to lose certain amount of weight, instead of beating yourself up for not getting there yet, you should compare some older photos of yourself to the new ones by doing so, you will get the visual proof of your progress which serves as great inspiration for future advances and inspires positive emotions step 3: reward yourself from early childhood, we get familiar with the achievement — reward formula which makes us consider it a norm in each such situation therefore, if you achieve certain success, no matter how big or small, your mind expects that you provide yourself with an adequate prize if the reward doesn’t come, your motivational fuel gets drained, making your efforts futile so, next time when you catch yourself single-mindedly chasing a complex goal without appreciating the small wins, give yourself a break and treat yourself to a movie, favorite sweet, or a short trip with your friends step 4: enjoy the process maybe the most important element to keep in mind in order to maintain mental strength in a competitive and goal-oriented world is to remind yourself to be content with yourself and the goals achieved remember to have fun and not take yourself too seriously enjoy experimenting and growing by appreciating the process and the lessons learned, you will be able to avoid the stress and negative emotions, even if you don’t achieve the ultimate goal endorsed by ricky tang editor love this article?

Article - taxes on cigarettes are rising yet again in chicago with a 50-cent increase that makes smokes in the windy city the most highly-taxed in the country chicagos city council overwhelmingly approved the cigarette tax hike as part of mayor rahm emanuels 2014 budget on tuesday in combination with state and local taxes, the city tax increase pushes the total taxes on cigarettes sold in the city to $717 a pack, wgn reports chicagos per-pack cigarette tax will be 31 cents higher than new york city’s $686 per pack making them the priciest cigarettes tax-wise in the nation according to emanuels budget, the 50-cent tax increase is expected to bring in $7 million for the city, the tribune reports though the tax increase is relatively hefty, it actually marks a rare concession from mayor emanuel the mayor originally proposed at 75-cent increase to the objection of city councilmen concerned it would be met with increased illegal sales of loose cigarettes in their wards the $3 million shortfall left by the lower tax increase will be filled by increasing the fine for parking in front a fire hydrant from $100 to $150 and tapping other revenue streams at the citys two airports ald jason ervin (28th) said regardless of the mayors decision to budge on the taxes, the high rate is likely to push smokers to purchase packs outside the city we still create the black market when we raise that bar at any level, ervin told the sun-times health officials, meanwhile, were dismayed that the tax on cigarettes wasnt higher the cheaper the cigarettes, the more people who are going to buy cigarettes and the more people who are going to die, the american heart association’s mark peysakhovich told the sun-times the day before the city council vote the city, however, is still cracking down on smoking in other ways: emanuel and a few key aldermen are reportedly looking to heavily restrict e-cigarette use in the city with rules that would effectively ban them from public spaces

Article_Title - the sexy lie we should be talking about: sexual objectification
Article - i am here today to talk about a lie thats how politics professor caroline heldman opened her jan 2013 tedxyouth san diego talk on the topic of sexual objectification id like to talk specifically about the lie, or the idea, that being a sex object is empowering heldman explained that sexual objectification is so common that many young people struggle to even recognize it as such: its like being raised in a red room, being pulled out of that room, and asked to describe the color red she added that girls may grow up believing that being objectified is actually empowering because american culture teaches that to be a sex object is to be valuable however, the consequences of objectification to society are far from positive, and side effects among women include body shame, depression, eating disorders, low self-esteem and even decreased sexual pleasure, according to heldman: instead of being involved and engaged in what is happening, you tend to view yourself from a third-party perspective a spectators perspective, where youre worried about rolls of fat hanging out, what that leg looks like it gets in the way of sexual pleasure so if theres anything i can pitch to you about why you dont want to live in a culture that sexually objectifies: it diminishes your sexual pleasure heldman drew on the work of others to create a 7-step test to determine if an image is sexually objectifying an image is sexually objectifying if yes is the answer to any of the following questions: does the image show only parts of a sexualized persons body? does the image present a sexualized person as a stand-in for an object? does the image show a sexualized person as interchangeable? does the image affirm the idea of violating the bodily integrity of a sexualized person that cant consent? does the image suggest that sexual availability is the defining characteristic of the person? does the image show a sexualized person as a commodity? does the image treat a sexualized persons body as a canvas? perhaps the most powerful part of the video is the end, where heldman invites us to imagine a different world, offering viewers tools to navigate, and eventually, change objectification culture we highly recommend watching

Article - read mother jones reporter shane bauers firsthand account of his four months spent working as a guard at a corporate-run prison in louisiana in 1887, a 23-year-old journalist got herself checked into the womens lunatic asylum on blackwells island in new york city when she emerged, she wrote about patients tied together with ropes, abusive staff and ubiquitous vermin, lunatics treated with nothing more restorative than ice baths, and, perhaps most disturbingly, patients who seemed to be perfectly sane, dumped there by a society that had few safety nets for women who were single, poor, and often immigrants serialized by joseph pulitzers new york world, nellie blys accounts (later collected in a book called ten days in a mad-house) caused a sensation, fueled in no small part by her pluck—shed begun her career by writing a scathing rebuttal to an editorial titled what girls are good for—though her ingénue looks couldnt have hurt, either but despite prose that shades purple to todays ears, blys work holds up not only for its daring, but for its impact: it prompted a grand jury investigation that led to changes shed proposed, including a $26 million (in todays dollars) increase to the budget of the citys department of public charities and correction and regulations to ensure that only the seriously mentally ill were committed access to prisons has been vastly curtailed there is no way to know what truly happens inside but to go there bly—whod go on to get herself arrested so she could investigate conditions at a womens prison, and to best jules vernes fictional protagonist by circumnavigating the world in 72 days—was not the first journalist to go inside an institution to expose its inner workings or the last ted conover also reported from behind prison walls, as did ben bagdikian, for whom mojos fellowship program is named in 1961, john howard griffin ingested a chemical that darkened his skin to investigate racial apartheid in the united states barbara ehrenreich took jobs at chain restaurants and walmart to spotlight the plight of low-wage workers mac mcclelland worked as a picker in a warehouse of an online shipping behemoth to report for mother jones but while such investigations were commonplace in the muckraker era, theyve grown increasingly rare why? first, theres a real concern over ethics when is it okay for reporters to not announce themselves as such? theres no governing body of journalism, but a checklist written by poynter ethicist bob steele provides guidelines for assessing when this kind of reporting is acceptable ill paraphrase: when the information obtained is of vital public interest when other efforts to gain that information have been exhausted when the journalist is willing to disclose the reason and nature of any deception when the news organization applies the skill, time, and funding needed to fully pursue the story when the harm prevented outweighs any harm caused after meaningful deliberation of the ethical and legal issues to see what private prisons are really like, shane bauer applied for a job with the corrections corporation of america he used his own name and social security number, and he noted his employment with the foundation for national progress, the publisher of mother jones he did not lie he spent four months as a guard at a cca-run louisiana prison, and then we spent 14 more months reporting and fact-checking we took these extraordinary steps because press access to prisons and jails has been vastly curtailed in recent decades, even as inmates have seen their ability to sue prisons—often the only way potential abuses would pop up on the radar of news organizations or advocates—dramatically reduced there is no other way to know what truly happens inside but to go there but heres the other reason investigations like this one have grown so rare: litigation when abc news busted food lion for repackaging spoiled meat for sale back in 1992, a jury bought the companys line that the real offense had been the falsification of employment applications and the reporters failure to fulfill their assigned duties—ie, repackaging spoiled meat! the $55 million damage award was eventually knocked down to just two dollars, but it put a chill on this kind of muckraking for a generation, and during that time, corporate and official entities built an ever-tighter web of legal protections nondisclosure agreements—once mainly the provenance of people who work on apple product launches and beyoncé videos—are now seeping into jobs of all stripes, where they commingle with various other non-disparagement clauses and employer protection statutes somewhere along the way, employers legitimate interest in protecting hard-won trade secrets has turned into an all-purpose tool for shutting down public scrutiny—even when the organizations involved are more powerful than agencies of government companies interest in protecting trade secrets has turned into a tool for shutting down public scrutiny or when, for that matter, they replace the government when cca (which runs 61 prisons, jails, and detention centers on behalf of us taxpayers) learned about our investigation, it sent us a four-page letter warning that shane had knowingly and deliberately breached his duty to cca by violating its policies, and that there could be all manner of legal consequences the letter came not from ccas in-house counsel, but from the same law firm that had represented a billionaire megadonor in his three-year quest to punish us for reporting on his anti-lgbt activities when he lost, he pledged $1 million to support others who might want to sue us, and, though we won the case, were it not for the support of our readers the out-of-pocket costs would have hobbled us shanes story will draw a fair bit of curiosity around the newsgathering methods employed but dont let anyone distract you from the story itself because the story itself is revealing as hell if you think stories like this need to be told, please make a tax-deductible donation to mother jones to help underwrite our investigations

Article - nutrition during the 1,000 days between a child’s conception and their second birthday is critical to their future success, dictating both brain and physical development and yet the vegetable american toddlers are most likely to eat is a french fry child health advocates gathered on capitol hill wednesday to mark the release of a new report, the first 1,000 days: nourishing america’s future, which documents the scourge of malnutrition in the us 1,000 days, a nonprofit that advocates nationally and globally for better early nutrition, produced the report, which highlights the economic gap that prevents many families from meeting some of the world health organization’s basic nutritional standards the report highlights a number of factors: nearly half of us women gain an excessive amount of weight during pregnancy, which can lead to higher rates of obesity in children and only 22 percent of infants are exclusively breastfed to 6 months, which the who recommends due to breastmilk’s unparalleled nutritional properties those deficiencies are largely due to a lack of institutional support, as less than half of moms receive any paid time off after childbirth, limiting their ability to breastfeed the report also found that at least 40 percent of parents introduce solid foods and sugary drinks to their children too early, and one in four toddlers don’t receive enough iron in their diet that doesn’t even begin to address all the economic factors at play half of the babies born in this country are participating in women, infants and children program here in the united states, lucy sullivan, the executive director of 1,000 days, said on capitol hill wednesday, referring to the program commonly known as wic that’s a reminder that the problems we are dealing with is not a small population over here somewhere in the us that maybe looks like the population of a developing country, she added it is all of us the face of hunger and malnutrition looks like america hugh welsh, the president of dsm, a major global producer of vitamins, minerals and nutrition supplements, highlighted the lack of understanding in the us about the dire need for a well-balanced mix of vitamins and nutrients i could travel to malawi, and everyone there would understand, but i could travel to milwaukee and no one would understand what i was talking about with micronutrients, he said in the first 1,000 days of a child’s life, the brain needs the proper mix of nutrients to fully form without enough iron or specific vitamins, a child’s brain may never form all its potential synapses they can also be physically weaker, and the combination can set the child up to be less competitive in the workforce later in life and raise their health care costs experts also worry that the nutritional diets of infants today mimic those of a growing number of overweight and obese american adults, setting them up for a lifetime unhealthy food choices and health problems the face of hunger and malnutrition looks like america lucy sullivan, executive director of 1,000 days barbara bush, daughter of former president george w bush and the ceo and co-founder of global health corps, stressed the irreversibility of the first 1,000 days you can’t catch up, she told the huffington post it will impact everything you do, whether that be how you learn or if you can learn fully and all of your mechanisms to engage in life rep lynn jenkins (r-kan) echoed bush: these children are losing the chance to reach their full potential before they even get started advocates said they were pleased the usda and the department of health and human services have started to develop the first-ever dietary guidelines for children under the age of 2, but those standards are not expected until 2020 the panel and congressional leaders highlighted the need for legislation about increased nutritional information and paid family leave sen bob casey (d-pa) said the issue requires bipartisan action this has to be a commitment to putting kids, and their need for access to food and nutrition, in the front of the agenda, casey said he called for a marshall plan for the children of america, much like the billions of dollars in economic support the us gave to europe after wwii bush echoed those calls to action, stressing that america’s children need access to these fundamental nutrients as they grow the most devastating part is when you are 2 years old and younger, you don’t have a lot of control over your life, she said but it can have an impact on your life in perpetuity

Article - in february 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named bruno kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of bruniquel cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years the cave sits in france’s scenic aveyron valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble he eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through they found themselves in a large, roomy corridor there were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent the floor was pockmarked with pools of water the walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up) some 336 meters into the cave, the caver stumbled across something extraordinary—a vast chamber where several stalagmites had been deliberately broken most of the 400 pieces had been arranged into two rings—a large one between 4 and 7 metres across, and a smaller one just 2 metres wide others had been propped up against these donuts yet others had been stacked into four piles traces of fire were everywhere, and there was a mass of burnt bones these weren’t natural formations, and they weren’t the work of bears they were built by people recognizing the site’s value, the caver brought in archaeologist francois rouzaud using carbon-dating, rouzaud estimated that a burnt bear bone found within the chamber was 47,600 years old, which meant that the stalagmite rings were older than any known cave painting it also meant that they couldn’t have been the work of homo sapiens their builders must have been the only early humans in the south of france at the time: neanderthals the discovery suggested that neanderthals were more sophisticated than anyone had given them credit for they wielded fire, ventured deep underground, and shaped the subterranean rock into complex constructions perhaps they even carried out rituals; after all, there was no evidence that anyone actually lived in the cave, so what else were the rings and mounds for? rouzaud would never know in april 1999, while guiding colleagues through a different cave, he suffered a fatal heart attack with his death, work on the bruniquel cave ceased, and its incredible contents were neglected they’ve only now re-entered the limelight because sophie verheyden went on holiday when i announced the age to jacques, he asked me to repeat it because it was so incredible a life-long caver, verheyden works at the royal belgian institute of natural sciences, where she specializes in stalagmites she treats them as time capsules, using the chemicals within them to reconstruct the climate of past millennia so when she learned about bruniquel cave, while visiting the region on holiday and seeing a display at a nearby castle, she had only one thought: why hadn’t anyone dated the broken stalagmites themselves? she knew that rouzaud’s date of 47,600 years was impressive but suspect carbon-dating is only accurate for samples younger than 50,000 years, so the bruniquel material was hitting the technique’s limits they could well have been much older to get a better estimate, verheyden assembled a team including archaeologist jacques jaubert and fellow stalagmite expert dominique genty in 2013, they got permission to study the site and crawled into it themselves i’m not very big, and i had to put one arm before me and one behind to get through, says verheyden it’s kind of magical, even without the structures after drilling into the stalagmites and pulling out cylinders of rock, the team could see an obvious transition between two layers on one side were old minerals that were part of the original stalagmites; on the other were newer layers that had been laid down after the fragments were broken off by the cave’s former users by measuring uranium levels on either side of the divide, the team could accurately tell when each stalagmite had been snapped off for construction their date? 176,500 years ago, give or take a few millennia when i announced the age to jacques, he asked me to repeat it because it was so incredible, says verheyden outside bruniquel cave, the earliest, unambiguous human constructions are just 20,000 years old most of these are ruins—collapsed collections of mammoth bones and deer antlers by comparison, the bruniquel stalagmite rings are well-preserved and far more ancient and if rouzaud’s work made it unlikely that modern humans built the rings, verheyden’s study grinds that possibility into the dust neanderthals must have been responsible there simply wasn’t any other hominin in that region at that time when you see such a structure so far into the cave, you think of something cultural or religious why did they build the rings and mounds? the structures weren’t foundations for huts; the chamber contains no stone tools, human bones, or any other sign of permanent occupation, and besides, why build shelter inside a cave? a plausible explanation is that this was a meeting place for some type of ritual social behavior, says paola villa from the university of colorado museum when you see such a structure so far into the cave, you think of something cultural or religious, but that’s not proven, adds verheyden indeed, despite some fanciful speculations about cave bear cults, no one really knows nor is it clear how the neanderthals made the structures verheyden says it couldn’t have been one lone artisan, toiling away in the dark most likely, there was a team, and a technically skilled one at that they broke rocks deliberately, and arranged them precisely they used fire, too more than 120 fragments have red and black streaks that aren’t found elsewhere in the chamber or the cave beyond they were the result of deliberately applied heat, at intensities strong enough to occasionally crack the rock the neanderthal group responsible for these constructions had a level of social organization that was more complex than previously thought, the team writes

Article - the cavs then saw the simple truth play out twice more in the regular season then again in game 1 of the nba finals and again in game 2 of the nba finals sunday the cavaliers have been taught the simple truth seven times now — all warriors wins — and yet they have not come to the understanding that they cannot take 2s and expect to beat 3s and because the lesson has not been learned, another simple truth has come forward: the cavaliers cannot win these nba finals frankly, theyd be lucky to win a game the warriors have now won seven consecutive games against the cavs — three straight to claim last seasons title, twice in the 2015-16 regular season, and now twice in these nba finals — and in each effort, the cavs have found themselves further and further from victory nothing about these warriors wins has been flukey this is what they do they are prolific and ruthless — a juggernaut of the highest order if anything, the warriors have given the cavs opportunities in the first two games of the series: in game 1, the splash brothers combined to shoot 30 percent from the floor and the warriors only made nine 3-pointers total in game 2, golden state turned the ball over 20 times those were windows — the cracks might have been small, but there was a gap there, and the cavs couldnt take advantage of it the simple truth loomed too large the warriors made 15 3-pointers while the cavs made 5 on sunday, a difference of 30 points in a 33-point warriors win — the seventh-largest margin of victory in nba finals history the cavs came into sundays game saying they were going to shoot more 3-pointers, that they were going to go back to playing the style that pushed them through the eastern conference playoffs with ease it was going to be hard — coach tyronn lue was clearly fond of telling reporters over the two-day gap between games 1 and 2 that its nearly impossible to create ball movement against the warriors defense, which switches assignments at all five positions — but the cavs had to try, it was the only path to victory instead, the cavs shot two more 3-pointers in game 2 compared to game 1 they made two fewer overall, cleveland is 12-of-44 from beyond the arc in this series, while jr smith, the teams most prolific 3-point shooter, has made only two shots from distance in the finals and is shooting a 3-pointer once every 10 minutes hes on the court the warriors are smothering him, and hes not a dynamic enough player to create his own shot -- at least not an effective one how do the cavs win a game in this series? it certainly appears that its going to take some impressive changes and adjustments to do so — the kind of changes that look beyond lue, who inexplicably blamed not getting to 50-50 balls and not making the tougher plays as the reasons behind his teams blowout loss sunday not being beaten in every single aspect of the game, as lebron james said in his postgame press conference — 50-50 balls the cavaliers are in the deepest 2-0 hole in nba finals history — the warriors 48-point differential is the largest ever through two games — and it has almost nothing to do with 50-50 balls it has to do with the warriors elite defense it has to do with the warriors bench being worthy of a playoff spot in the eastern conference it has to do with kyrie irving and kevin love being underachieving one-way players in a series that demands two-way play against a team that has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that theyll exploit weak defenders with cruel efficiency it has to do with the cavs needing jr smith to be a consistent offensive producer on a nightly basis if they plan on winning it has to do with the cavs daring draymond green to beat them and then him doing just that it has to do with cleveland changing its offensive system and defensive ideology on the fly against perhaps the greatest team of all-time it has to do with the simple truth that 3 is greater than 2 the cavs clearly havent learned that lesson yet, and unless a truly unpredictable turnaround is looming, its too late for them to do anything about it

Article_Title - waiter-less, cashier-less restaurant is the stuff of the future
Article - weve seen the future of fast food and its full of secretive cooking, utensils popping out of walls and a whole lot of quinoa eatsa, an innovative, vegetarian automated restaurant chain, which just opened its first east coast location (in new york) on wednesday, is looking to revolutionize the food industry by offering customers a one-of-a-kind food experience the tech-savvy restaurant aims to offer fresh, affordable food fast, but with an unconventional twist: it replaces the presence of good old-fashioned cashiers and waiters with robots instead of the usual face-to-face ordering and pickup, customers at eatsa simply order their food by means of in-store kiosks, online or through an app on their phones the food then mysteriously appears on location in a glass cubby displaying the customers name, and theyre free to chow down this means no lines, no counter and no human conversation, because what could be worse?  the concept, while intriguing, also sounds a bit terrifying so with a mind full of skepticism mashable headed down to the newly opened midtown manhattan location to see what all the hype is about while one might assume a cashier-free environment would be completely devoid of human interaction, that was far from the case though i initially feared the establishment would have a lifeless art gallery-esque vibe, the music was pumping, the customers were chatting and upon walking into the sleek restaurant i was instantly greeted by a friendly eatsa mascot much like apple geniuses, eatsa has several employees stationed on the floor to offer customer assistance and ensure youre not entirely left alone there are always people on the floor — our mascots, we call them — and we’re out here helping the guests and getting them through the process, explained scott bruggman, an eatsa corporate trainer who began as an r&d chef creating bowls to the right of the wood-floored room stood a row of electronic ordering kiosks, and to the left, the restaurant had several tables for those who wanted to engage in a slightly more familiar dining experience this all felt relatively tame, but the back of the restaurant held the real magic: a wall made entirely of electronic, microwave-looking cubbies that would reveal your mysteriously prepared meal zap  since there was no one to take my order, i made my way to the kiosk to choose from the customizable bowls, bites and beverages on eatsas strictly vegetarian menu once i put in my request for a hummus & falafel bowl, i walked toward the illuminated cubbies and within minutes my name was displayed on the screen above them, alerting me that my order was up this was the moment of truth right before your food arrives in your cubby, eatsa fills you with intrigue your cubby turns completely dark to prevent you from seeing the secrets of the kitchen and tantalizingly displays the words, its coming after youre given a playful peek at your meal, the cubby gives you the literal green light and you can receive your meal by tapping the glass twice tbh, it felt like something straight out of the jetsons the process was quick, simple and the food was fresh, as promised though i was satisfied with the space-age experience, i couldnt stop wondering what the hell was going on behind that wall of mystery i turned to dean marsh, director of market operations for the east coast for some answers, but was kindly shut down marsh adamantly explained that much like the secrecy of costumed characters at disney world, the public is not supposed to know what truly goes on in the depths of the eatsa kitchen very ominous despite the attempt to keep the tricks of the trade to themselves, many believe that several human chefs work alongside robots the eatsa bots are back there, bruggman said there’s a lot of different things going on and we use as much technology as we can to better enhance the experience first-time customers and vegetarians madee bryke and her boyfriend andrew powell also had their theories there are people back there; i know that, bryke said i think it’s fun that there’s robots, but there are definitely people still working as of right now, bruggman described the tech and human ratio as a real blend — that’s how we make it so fast and so quick with the rise of technology creating strong barriers against personal interaction, one of the major concerns the innovative restaurant raises is that the lack of human interaction may come across as too impersonal while this may seen like a dream for introverts, surprisingly, the futuristic vibe only made things more fun millennials, such as sabina m who works a few blocks away and was eating there for the second day in a row, felt that if anything, the environment was encouraging people to be more social maybe it’s just because of the novelty, she said, but it seems like people are almost more social here cause everyone’s like woah this is crazy so it’s kind of getting people to talk to one another  bryke and powell, also millennials, agreed i definitely think it almost opens it up to more talk, it seems like they have a community, bryke said her boyfriend, powell, said that when you think about it, the automated restaurant is not much different from other forms of take-out people already order seamless and then go pick it up from a delivery guy so how is this much different? it’s almost like a robot’s making it anyways to get a sense of how the older demographic was feeling about the revolutionary service, gen x-er and first-time customer, maarten nederlof gave mashable his two-cents we’re a little older and have been watching the whole decline in social interaction, he said so this is a walk on the non-interacting side for us, but i think for younger people who have no social interaction, coming here is a great avoidance scheme nederlof explained that there are still tables, so people getting food can sit down inside and socialize therefore its the best of both worlds are you really missing out on that much? he questioned  marsh, director of market operations for easta, feels the restaurants technology is actually giving people more time to engage in social interaction where you may spend 15 to 20 minutes at any of our competitors getting in and out with the regular fast food concept, for us its three to four minutes we feel that extra time gives you even more time interact with people, he said  though the manhattan eatsa has only been open for a few days, the restaurants unique style is receiving a lot of love (just like like the five other locations in california and dc) every restaurant competitor on the street has been in at least two times and we’ve only been open for two days we’ve gotten a lot of interest from the big boys: the mcdonalds and starbucks of the world, he said whats next? perhaps an automated restaurant to please all the meat-eaters out there

Article - the marvel cinematic universe, or (mcu) is a shared fictional universe focused on a series of superhero films that are based on characters that appear in marvel comics in addition to feature films, it also includes comic books, short films, and television series films in the mcu have been split into three distinct phases it was acquired back in 2009 by the walt disney co dis for $4 billion many were worried that the deal would both ruin beloved marvel characters like iron man and damage disneys financial standing and stock valuation fast forward to 2016, and disneys acquisition could very well be one of the best things to happen to both the media giant and the comic book publisher however, it looks like the mcu is quickly coming to an end, at least as we know it in an interview with ign , anthony russo-who will be directing the upcoming avengers films with his brother joe-said that these two movies are intended to be the culmination of everything that has happened in the mcu since the very first iron man moviein being a culmination, these movies are in some ways going to be an end to certain things, and in some ways, theyre going to be the beginning of certain things with this in mind, how much money has marvel grossed at the total worldwide box office? and how much more can it bring in? lets break it down: phase one iron man - $585,174,222 the incredible hulk - $263,427,551 iron man 2 , bringing in $623,933,331 thor - $449,326,618 captain america: the first avenger - $370,569,774 the avengers - $1,518,594,910 phase two iron man 3 - $1,518,594,910 thor: the dark world - $644,783,140 captain america: the winter soldier - $714,121,534 guardians of the galaxy - $774,176,600 avengers: age of ultron - $1,398,858,115 ant-man - $518,585,201 phase three phase three is just in its beginning stage, but will wrap up by 2019 the first of the last 10 films of the mcu, captain america: civil war , brought in almost $15 billion worldwide during its theatrical release audiences can look forward to doctor strange hitting theaters this fall; guardians of the galaxy 2 , spider-man: homecoming , and thor: ragnarok debuting in 2017; black panther , avengers: infinity war , and ant-man and the wasp premiering in 2018; and captain marvel and the untitled avengers sequel coming to theaters in 2019 the marvel effect as of now, the mcu has grossed $10,527,843,932 at the box office, and if the next nine films can live up to each of their respective predecessors, the franchise could very well double, and even triple, its worldwide earnings both of the next avengers films could easily make $1 billion each, and if the next guardians , thor , and ant-man movies follow in common sequel fashion, they could all make well over their originals total earnings predicting gross profit from films is difficult, as hollywood accounting is notoriously complicated, but it is safe to argue that marvel has proven to be the ultimate money maker its films, comics, tv shows, merchandise, and all other revenue sources show that disney made the entertainment deal of a lifetime want the latest recommendations from zacks investment research? today, you can download 7 best stocks for the next 30 days  click to get this free report >> want the latest recommendations from zacks investment research? today, you can download 7 best stocks for the next 30 days click to get this free report

Article - new york -- a majority of young americans say student debt is a major issue facing the nation, a new poll finds, and many blame colleges for the problem fifty-eight percent of adults ages 18 to 24 consider rising student debt levels in the united states a major problem, according to survey results released exclusively to the huffington post on tuesday by the harvard university institute of politics only 3 percent said its not an issue at all, while 22 percent called it a minor problem yet even among people who werent enrolled in college, 54 percent still considered student debt a major issue a plurality -- 39 percent -- blame colleges and universities for the rising amount of student debt, compared with just 10 percent who think students are at fault survey respondents were more likely to blame colleges for rising student debt if they were currently enrolled in school the cost of a college degree has increased 12-fold in the last 30 years, while having such a degree has become even more important to those seeking full-time employment but policy experts and consumer watchdogs have increasingly flagged the wealth loss and ripple effect that the nations $12 trillion in student debt is having on the economy as a whole young people who are coming of age today understand that getting a postsecondary education is important [but] they have a lot of fear about the rising cost of higher education, said rory osullivan, policy and research director at young invincibles, a group that aims to represent young people in policy debates matthew segal, co-founder and head of millennial advocacy nonprofit ourtimeorg, was pleasantly surprised to see that young adults are putting responsibility for the trend with colleges people are finally realizing that the college arms race must stop if we are ever going to rein in costs, segal said segal noted that george washington university, for instance, is currently building a $130 million super dorm on campus, and students at the university of pennsylvania are able to dine at a juice bar after hitting up the golf simulator at one of the campus fitness centers this phenomena of spending resources on extravagant secondary amenities isnt limited to private schools, either: iowa state university recently spent $462 million renovating one of two campus gyms, resulting in a facility equipped with rock walls and hot tubs, while the university of california-davis offers swimming pools in some residence halls too many colleges are acting in the interest of building prestige over providing an affordable pathway to higher learning for their students, segal said however, 32 percent of respondents in the new survey pointed the finger at the federal government, which handles roughly 85 percent of the nations outstanding student debt the us department of education collected $425 billion from borrowers in fiscal year 2013 alone although osullivan believes theres plenty of blame to go around, he was struck by how few placed responsibility on state governments, despite the connection between state legislative appropriations and tuition at public colleges only 8 percent of harvards survey respondents said state governments were to blame for rising student loan debt a 2012 new york federal reserve study linked mounting tuition costs at public universities, where a majority of students get their degrees, to state budget cuts a previous huffington post/yougov poll found most americans believe state universities are no longer affordable we invest less than we used to, per student, osullivan noted young invincibles is currently working with student groups on campuses to raise awareness of how the state budget process affects their tuition bill osullivan believes the trillion-dollar number has captured the attention of many people, but now its important to explain why student debt is big and what it is we need to fix it more than 7 in 10 in the harvard poll said that their own financial circumstances were an important factor in whether or not they attended college the huffington post collaborated with the harvard institute of politics on questions asked of college-age americans a larger update to harvards biennial study of younger americans will be publicly released wednesday

Article_Title - the vet who euthanised herself in taiwan
Article - a new law banning animal euthanasia is set to take force in taiwan it comes almost a year after the shocking suicide of a vet overwhelmed by grief at the plight of stray animals the bbcs cindy sui explores this tragedy perhaps veterinarian and animal lover chien chih-cheng was in the wrong job at the wrong time she often worked overtime, rarely took a proper lunch break, and sacrificed her holidays to give the dogs more attention and make their lives better, winnie lai, her colleague at a shelter for abandoned dogs in taoyuan city, remembers as a graduate of taiwans top university with the highest score in a civil service examination, ms chien could have chosen a desk job at head office, but opted to personally care for the many pets abandoned each year in taiwan the shelters lobby was decorated with pictures of animals drawn by ms chien to encourage adoptions, but many of them were destined to be put down on 5 may last year, ms chien took her own life, using the same drug she used to put down animals she said she wanted to help people understand what happens to strays in taiwan taiwan was gripped by anger and soul-searching in the weeks that followed, most of it focused on a life tragically cut short but people also asked why frontline workers in taiwans battle against pet abandonment were being put under so much pressure you might also be interested in in an interview ms chien once did with a local tv station cti, she described the first time she saw an animal put down i went home and cried all night, she said but it was media appearances like this that meant she came under personal attack when it was revealed she had put down 700 dogs in two years, she was labelled the beautiful slaughterer shelter workers dreaded putting down the dogs, but ms chien and others saw this as a better end for the unwanted, ageing or difficult-to-adopt animals than leaving them at risk of disease in overcrowded shelters they called her a butcher we are frequently scolded some people say well go to hell they say we love to kill and are cruel, said kao yu-jie, one of her co-workers but people still abandon their dogs you hear all kinds of reasons: their dog is too mean, or not mean enough, barks too much, or doesnt bark enough high kill rate taiwan has two main problems when it comes to animal welfare: the number of pets being abandoned and the number of strays allowed to reproduce in reality, the situation has improved over the past decade thanks to increased public awareness and efforts by shelters and activists to discourage abandonment and encourage adoptions but the number of animals put down remains high and shelters are still underfunded and understaffed the work is difficult and hours long in some shelters, half the animals are killed in 2015 around 10,900 were put down and about 8,600 shelter animals died last year from other causes, such as illness in the cti interview, ms chien described the process of putting a dog down we first let it take a stroll and eat some snacks and talk to it then we take it into the humane room when you put it on the table, its very scared and its whole body is shaking but after we administer the drug, it leaves in three to five seconds it no longer shakes actually, its very sad no psychological counselling was provided for the staff psychological support in this and other fields is practically unheard of in taiwan the taoyuan shelter actually had one of the lowest euthanasia rates and highest adoption rates of any shelter but a letter ms chien left behind when she killed herself suggested her concern for the welfare of the animals had consumed her her colleagues attest to this, although experts remind us that many and complex factors lie behind any suicide she put herself under a lot of pressure she cared a lot about the animals and the pressure from the work affected her, said ms lai in the letter, ms chien wrote: i hope my departure will let all of you know stray animals are also life i hope the government knows the importance of controlling the source [of the problem] please value life the irony of her exhortation to value life was not lost on observers and blame was quick to be handed out newspapers accused the government of murdering her, with many saying it failed to come up with effective ways to stamp out pet abandonment or prevent strays from reproducing some accused higher-level bureaucrats of trying to convince the public that ms chien simply couldnt handle her work pressures but other commentators said that while shelter workers were easy to target, all of society must take responsibility many believe the root of the problem is the insufficient enforcement of a neutering and spaying law the chief of the animal protection section of the council of agriculture, chiang wen-chuan, said a law requiring spaying and neutering only recently came into effect, and doesnt allow staff to impose fines immediately and even though staff pay visits to the owners of 60,000 animals each year to urge them to follow the laws, only 30% of the islands 17 million dogs have been spayed or neutered we are very short-staffed all of taiwan only has 140 animal protection staff, said mr chiang its a systematic problem ending euthanasia and expanding shelters and staff will not solve the problem some taiwanese also believe such medical procedures change the personality of their pets others want to breed to give to friends or sell short-term measures ms chien already knew, when she died, that a new law was coming into force from 4 february 2017, it will be illegal to put down abandoned animals budgets have also increased by 40%, there will be more inspectors and now anybody who wishes to abandon their pet at a shelter will have to pay a fee as high as $125 (£100) the authorities say this is nothing to do with ms chiens suicide, and her story, which was simply a human tragedy the government has pledged to increase funding and staffing at shelters and provide psychological counselling but many see these as short-term measures activists want the government to crack down on breeders, implement subsidies for ngos to spay and neuter, and provide assistance to groups that take in strays perhaps ms chien was not the catalyst for the changes, but her love for animals will not be forgotten by her husband, also an animal control worker, and her colleagues - all of whom were left pain-stricken by her death

Article - i’ve learned that work is most fulfilling when it’s a calling and often, it’s a calling because you find a deep sense of purpose and positive impact in your role and fortunately, the data show that purpose is incredibly tied to both business and personal success in corporate culture and performance, authors john kotter and james heskett write that purposeful, value-based companies outperform their counterparts with 400% higher revenues, 700% greater job growth and 1,200% higher stock prices but having purpose doesn’t only impact the organization you work for; it also impacts you research from the hay group shows that highly engaged employees are, on average, 50% more likely to exceed expectations than their least engaged counterparts as a result, i believe that, to be both successful and fulfilled, it is crucial to understand what purpose means to you granted, finding your purpose is a proactive pursuit many people start to explore their feelings when they’re unhappy, dissatisfied with their job and/or upset with their personal life but it is important to find time to reflect when you find yourself in a good place, too when you’re experiencing fulfillment and joy in your work or in your personal life, take a moment to ask yourself, what am i doing right now that is making me fulfilled? are you helping someone? are you coding? are you being creative? are you creating the best financial model the world has ever seen? the answers to this question often bring to the surface what is important to you and can help you recreate that satisfaction moving forward i’ve also found it helpful to create a personal vision for your life spend some time thinking about what your ideal day would be like i keep a dream book myself, and i’ve filled it with things that are important to me—from building a great tech company that is tackling a hard but important problem to building and maintaining lifelong friendships to checking items off of my travel bucket list it even includes a picture of a well-landscaped backyard because that’s been on my list of projects to tackle—and trust me, you need vision to see beyond the weeds that are back there today so spend time creating a vision for your life ask yourself key questions about the role that purpose will play trust me, your vision can and will change over time but knowing what you want your life to look like and then working to establish annual, monthly or even daily goals and habits to help you live that life—in and out of the workplace—is absolutely key to success and more importantly, it is absolutely key to finding your passion for life

Article - while some people might think it’s silly, there really are angels among us every single day of the year — all you have to do is know where to look! quintin conway is just a normal guy, but that doesn’t mean he can’t be an angel for someone out there in the world! he was having a particularly rough day at work, and he admits that he was busy feeling sorry for himself, but that’s when he looked out of the window of his truck right in that moment of self-pity, he saw a 60-year-old woman sitting alone in her car reading a book she looked lonely and sad, but things got even more emotional for conway when he realized she was completely bald now he doesn’t know for sure what was going on in that woman’s life, but he made the assumption that it must be something pretty big, and right at that moment, conway got the sudden urge to give that lady a small gift he went back into the store he was just in, still cranky and mad at his job, but he got that lady a present and said something to her that proves there must be angels in the world he might not have wings, but he’s got a big heart! while he didn’t want to film the video at first, we’re sure glad he did since then, it’s gotten over 3 million views, and it should really remind us all to put things in perspective some of our problems might be bigger than others, but we should always do our best to give a smile to someone else who might be hurting, just so they can do the same for the next person they meet

Article - more like grandpa-lpatine the conclusion of star wars: the force awakens left us all with one question: who are reys parents? while many people believed the final shot was a clue to rey being a skywalker, there were just as many theories that she was a kenobi, or someone totally unrelated to previous characters from the series but a new theory has awakened: that rey is in fact emperor palpatines granddaughter youtuber vincent vendetta uploaded a video compiling the evidence to support this theory, and honestly its pretty compelling theres the matter of their fighting styles both rey and palpatine are the only two characters in the star wars universe who use this forward-thrust move this mirroring is equally powerful when you realise the first move we see each of them perform is this forward thrust reys first lightsaber battle has several other visual references to palpatines fighting style, almost too many to be coincidental this cyclical referencing also works in the sense that the earlier films have followed a pattern of skywalker vs palpatine tension in the force awakens, if reys parentage does stem from palpatine, her battle against kylo ren continues the skywalker/palpatine tension, flipping the dark and light sides for now thats because rey is already struggling with the pull of the dark side while every fledgling jedi struggles between the pull of light and dark, there are moments during the force awakens that point to rey being tempted to the dark in the films script, it describes rey as standing on the edge of the dark side during reys vision, palpatine can be heard several times right before the hallway collapses on her, you can hear palpatines scream, and further along, theres audio of palpatine saying any jedi there are a few other audio snippets included (luke, obi-wan, and yoda to name a few) but palpatines inclusion seems like an outlier when you consider lukes lightsaber is the trigger for the vision why else would ol palps show up, if not because of some kind of relationship to rey? the notion of hiding in plain sight comes into play when you consider the poster for the force awakens in the portrait form, reys strategic placement puts her between the dark and light sides in the most literal sense but when expanded out, rey is placed toward the dark side, hanging with kylo ren, her staff aligned with his lightsaber to almost seem as if theyre one finally, what about the accent? a lot of people used reys british accent as evidence that she could be a kenobi, but guess who else had a fancy posh accent yep palpatine theres even more compelling evidence when you take into account clues from the films script, the accompanying novel, and other hints from the film

Article - after a long a long day of photosynthesizing, do trees fall asleep? it depends on how you define sleep, but trees do relax their branches at night, which might be a sign of snoozing, scientists said in the only reported study to look at tree siestas, researchers set up lasers that measured the movements of two silver birch trees (betula pendula) at night one tree was in finland and the other in austria, and both were monitored from dusk until morning on dry, windless nights in september this was close to the solar equinox, when daylight and nighttime are about equal [what is the oldest tree in the world?] the laser scanners used infrared light to illuminate different parts of the tree, each for fractions of a second this provided enough detail to map each tree within minutes, the researchers said the silver birches branches and leaves sagged at night; they reached their lowest position a few hours before sunrise, and then perked up again during the wee hours of the morning, the researchers found trees might sleep after dark, according to precise laser measurements that detected the plants branches drooping at night credit: eetu puttonen our results show that the whole tree droops during night, which can be seen as position change in leaves and branches, study lead author eetu puttonen, a researcher at the finnish geospatial research institute, said in a statement the changes are not too large, only up to 10 centimeters [4 inches] for trees with a height of about 5 meters [16 feet] its unclear if the sun woke up the trees or if they relied on their own internal circadian rhythm, the researchers said but the fact that some branches started returning to their daytime position already before sunrise would suggest this [internal circadian clock] hypothesis [is right], the researchers wrote in the study, which was published online on feb 29, 2016, in the journal frontiers in plant science the finding isnt too surprising, but oddly enough it hadnt been studied until now, the researchers said most living organisms have day and night circadian rhythms, and any gardener will notice that some plants open their flowers in the morning and that some trees close their leaves at night, the researchers said the famed botanist carl linnaeus (1707-1778) found that flowers confined to a dark cellar still opened and closed, and naturalist charles darwin (1809-1882) noted that the nocturnal movement of leaves and stalks on plants looked like sleep however, their studies concentrated on small plants grown in pots the finding in trees represents the first study to use lasers to precisely measure the nighttime movements of wild trees, the researchers said the tree study didnt address why the branches and leaves drooped at night, but its likely related to the turgidity, or the internal water pressure within the tree, the researchers said plant movement is always closely connected with the water balance of individual cells, which is affected by the availability of light through photosynthesis, said study co-author andrás zlinszky, a researcher at the centre for ecological research at the hungarian academy of sciences [how tall can trees grow?] the researchers said in the future, they plan to examine the water movement within each tree and compare it to measurements made by the laser scans this will give us a better understanding of the trees daily tree water use and their influence on the local or regional climate, puttonen said

Article - tech savvy  culturally aware  underemployed  spiritual but not religious  these are all words and phrases that have come to be associated with the milliennial generation, which is also sometimes referred to as generation y recently, however, two additional adjectives have worked their way into the millennial description pool: stressed and sleepless  the correlation between stress and sleep deprivation is becoming increasingly apparent in american society npr maintains that 60 million americans are currently battling insomnia according to an american psychological association study titled stress in america , more than 50 percent of millennials report to having been kept awake at least one night over the course of the past month due to stress this is comparable to only 37 percent of baby boomers and 25 percent of matures why does stress affect sleep? stress is widely recognized as the body’s response to potentially harmful situations, whether real or imagined although the effects of stress most certainly vary from person to person, general reactions include quickened breathing, tightened muscles, spiked blood pressure, and an increased heart rate fight or flight or sleep? these are, in short, all individual components of the body’s intrinsic and universally acknowledged fight-or-flight response many stressed out people have trouble falling asleep because they feel the weight of these symptoms most heavily at night best-selling author dr andrew weil, who received his md from harvard university in 1968, is a huge advocate of the benefits of holistic breathing practices in combatting stress and anxiety on his website , dr weil writes: breathing strongly influences physiology and thought processes, including moods by simply focusing your attention on your breathing, and without doing anything to change it, you can move in the direction of relaxation because the effects of stress include quick and shallow breaths that stem almost exclusively from the upper chest, perpetually stressed and anxious people are actually in the detrimental habit of under-breathing many stressed people are even known for subconsciously holding their breath that being said, mindful breathing practices are noticeably absent from the vast majority of western medicine those most familiar with the relationship between breathing and the body tend to be yogis and practitioners of eastern wellness methodologies how to do the 4-7-8′′ exercise dr weil is an influential public supporter of a previously little-known breathing technique known as the 4-7-8 exercise this trick, which began to capture national attention several years ago and has since been the subject of innumerable headlines, including one on oprahcom , is shockingly simple, takes hardly any time, and can be done pretty much anywhere here is how you do the exercise: place the tip of your tongue against the tissue ridge right above your upper front teeth keep it there for the remainder of the exercise exhale completely through your mouth, making a whoosh sound as you do so close your mouth and inhale slowly through your nose while mentally counting to four hold your breath for a mental count of seven exhale completely through your mouth for a mental count of eight make the same whoosh sound from step two this concludes the first cycle repeat the same process three more times for a total of four renditions in a nutshell: breathe in for four, hold for seven, and breathe out for eight you must inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth the four-count inhale allows chronic under-breathers to take in more oxygen the seven-count hold gives the oxygen more time to thoroughly permeate the bloodstream, and the eight-count exhale slows the heart rate and releases a greater amount of carbon dioxide from the lungs alina gonzalez, who wrote  how i learned to fall asleep in under 1 minute  for byrdiecom, says that 4-7-8 helped her fall asleep amid her nerves and severe anxiety the week before she was scheduled to give the bridesmaid speech at her best friend’s wedding when gonzalez told her friend that she was having trouble getting to sleep due to a combination of stress and pre-wedding jitters, the bride-to-be, who was a licensed wellness practitioner, told her that the 4-7-8 technique would change her life it did like so many others who swear by this method, the originally skeptical gonzalez wakes up each morning to the incredulous realization that s he does not even remember completing the final 4-7-8 cycle because it put her to sleep so quickly the 4-7-8 exercise certainly has the potential to help overly stressed, anxiety-ridden millennials (as well as members of the general population at large) fall asleep more quickly it is also known to have positive effects when implemented throughout the day during times of stress, anger, guilt, frustration, or internal tension when weighing the painlessness of this completely free method against the irritability, headaches, distractedness, impaired cognitive skills, weight gain, and even heart disease that can result from the performance killer known as sleep deprivation, it seems worth a shot

Article - if you’re a fan of chinese and japanese take-out meals, you may have used chopsticks several times if you’re dining at some fancy asian restaurant, you may have been given a pair of non-disposable chopsticks but most of us who have used the disposable ones are familiar with that little tab at the end of the chopsticks we usually break the sticks apart, coupled with rubbing them together to remove any loose splinters, and proceed to chow down the delectable sushi or that sumptuous dumpling you ordered from the local chinese restaurant but what if you’ve been wrong all your life and learned that there’s actually a purpose for that little tab there? that little tab was not placed there to keep those sticks together the chopsticks are not meant to be broken apart just yet without doing this first, important (clever) step that twitter user trash panda discovered who would’ve thought that that little bit of wood may actually be useful? the tab needs to be separated from the chopsticks and then it doubles up as a chopsticks holder this should give you some place to put the sticks while you enjoy your drink this way, it should keep your table and chopsticks clean if you think you’ve been living a lie your whole life, you’re not alone a lot of people expressed their amazement at the new discovery and most of them were like, wait, what? even this photo shows that this guy got it wrong then again, if you use those fancier plastic- or metal-made chopsticks, you always have holders that have cute designs to depend on just like these:

Article_Title - are student athletes more likely to commit sexual assault?
Article - are student athletes more likely to commit sexual assault? an investigation found that baylor university had mishandled sexual assault accusations against its football players by kate wheeling then-baylor head coach art briles looks on from the sidelines (photo: ron jenkins/getty images) last week, kenneth w starr was stripped of his title as president of baylor university after an independent investigation found that the university had mishandled sexual assault accusations against football players football head coach art briles was also fired as a result of the investigation starr, who will continue to serve as both chancellor and a law professor, gained notoriety as an independent counsel for his investigation of president bill clinton, the new york times reports: mr starr’s demotion delivered a twist to the biography of a man whose reputation was built on what many considered an overzealous pursuit of allegations of sexual transgressions by mr clinton now he is being punished for leading an administration that, according to a report from an ostensibly independent investigator, looked the other way when baylor football players were accused of sex crimes, and sometimes convicted of them the relationship between athletes and sexual assault is a decades-old discussion since at least the 1980s, high-profile rape cases involving famous athletes have led the press to speculate on whether players might be more prone to committing acts of sexual violence a string of sexual assault allegations in recent years has ensured that college athletic programs and the athletes that populate them will remain in the spotlight in the last two years alone, players from the university of tennessee-knoxville, florida state university, and the university of oregon have made headlines for assault allegations more than 160 higher education institutions are under investigation by the department of education’s office of civil rights for sexual violence allegations but are athletes actually more likely to commit sexual assaults, or are we just more likely to pay attention when they’re the ones accused of committing the crime? one factor to consider is that sexual violence does not occur in a vacuum anthropological research suggests that, rather than a purely psychological- or biological-driven act, sexual assaults are also highly influenced by culture peggy sanday, an emeritus professor of anthropology at the university of pennsylvania, found that some societies are more prone to rape than others; tribal societies with higher levels of male dominance, sex segregation, and tolerance of interpersonal violence had higher rates of rape in other words, some environments can encourage sexual aggression the recent investigation into baylor concluded that university officials created a cultural perception that football was above the rules college athletics are highly sex segregated, extremely male dominated, and, at least in the case of some sports — football and hockey, for example — violent by design while no university could be accused of explicitly encouraging sexual assault, several have been blamed for condoning such behaviors, or sweeping assault allegations under the rug the recent investigation into baylor, for example, concluded that university officials created a cultural perception that football was above the rules and the perceived lack of consequences for star athletes might embolden them to behave in sexually aggressive ways consider surveys that have found that between one in six and one in three men would be willing to use force to obtain sex from women as long as there were no consequences for their actions while members of sports teams — and other male-dominated groups like fraternities and the military — are indeed more likely to commit gang rapes than the average person, there are few conclusive studies to show that athletes are more likely to commit sex crimes there is some evidence that not all athletes are equally likely to be violent, according to laura finley, a sociologist at barry university finley told wisconsin public radio that players of power and performance sports — football, hockey, wrestling, and basketball — commit violent crimes more often that their peers in sports like swimming or tennis an analysis of national football league players by benjamin morris at fivethirtyeight showed that, though the football stars displayed lower levels of domestic and sexual violence than the national average, the rate of domestic violence was still much higher than expected given their income bracket without better data, it’s hard to say anything definitive on the matter even the oft-cited statistic that one in three sexual assaults on college campuses are carried out by athletes dates back not to a scientific study, but to a 1986 philadelphia daily news article (one 1995 study did, however, find that male athletes were overrepresented in reports of sexual assault on campuses) literature reviews, which are usually useful for identifying patterns in the sea of conflicting single studies that science produces, are also unreliable here: one recent review found that the bulk of research on the subject was inconclusive; another, however, found higher rates of violence among student athletes we can at least say with certainty that universities have not been effective in handling the cases of sexual misconduct by athletes a 2014 survey found that, in more than one-fifth of universities, the athletic department oversaw cases involving sexual assault allegations against athletes, prompting the national collegiate athletic association to issue a resolution that athletic departments can only participate in, but never lead, investigations into such allegations still, the recent investigation at baylor found that the university’s football program frequently dealt with sexual assault allegations internally

Article_Title - why voting for donald trump is a morally good choice
Article - some of my christian friends tell me they can’t in good conscience vote for donald trump because, when faced with a choice between the lesser of two evils, the morally right thing is to choose neither one they recommend voting for a third-party or write-in candidate as a professor who has taught christian ethics for 39 years, i think their analysis is incorrect now that trump has won the gop nomination, i think voting for trump is a morally good choice american citizens need patience with each other in this difficult political season close friends are inevitably going to make different decisions about the election we still need to respect each other and thank god that we live in a democracy with freedom to differ about politics and we need to keep talking with each other – because democracies function best when thoughtful citizens can calmly and patiently dialog about the reasons for their differences this is my contribution to that discussion a good candidate with flaws i do not think that voting for donald trump is a morally evil choice because there is nothing morally wrong with voting for a flawed candidate if you think he will do more good for the nation than his opponent in fact, it is the morally right thing to do i did not support trump in the primary season i even spoke against him at a pastors’ conference in february but now i plan to vote for him i do not think it is right to call him an evil candidate i think rather he is a good candidate with flaws he is egotistical, bombastic, and brash he often lacks nuance in his statements sometimes he blurts out mistaken ideas (such as bombing the families of terrorists) that he later must abandon he insults people he can be vindictive when people attack him he has been slow to disown and rebuke the wrongful words and actions of some angry fringe supporters he has been married three times and claims to have been unfaithful in his marriages these are certainly flaws, but i don’t think they are disqualifying flaws in this election on the other hand, i think some of the accusations hurled against him are unjustified his many years of business conduct show that he is not racist or anti-(legal) immigrant or anti-semitic or misogynistic – i think these are unjust magnifications by a hostile press exaggerating some careless statements he has made i think he is deeply patriotic and sincerely wants the best for the country he has been an unusually successful problem solver in business he has raised remarkable children many who have known him personally speak highly of his kindness, thoughtfulness, and generosity but the main reason i call him a good candidate with flaws is that i think most of the policies he supports are those that will do the most good for the nation seek the good of the nation should christians even try to influence elections at all? yes, definitely the apostle peter says christians are exiles on this earth (1 peter 1:1) therefore i take seriously the prophet jeremiah’s exhortation to the jewish people living in exile in babylon: seek the welfare of the city where i have sent you into exile, and pray to the lord on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare (jeremiah 29:7) by way of modern application, i think christians today have a similar obligation to vote in such a way that will seek the welfare of the united states therefore the one overriding question to ask is this: which vote is most likely to bring the best results for the nation? if this election is close (which seems likely), then if someone votes for a write-in candidate instead of voting for trump, this action will directly help hillary clinton, because she will need one less vote to win therefore the question that christians should ask is this: can i in good conscience act in a way that helps a liberal like hillary clinton win the presidency? under president obama, a liberal federal government has seized more and more control over our lives but this can change this year we have an unusual opportunity to defeat hillary clinton and the pro-abortion, pro-gender-confusion, anti-religious liberty, tax-and-spend, big government liberalism that she champions i believe that defeating that kind of liberalism would be a morally right action therefore i feel the force of the words of james: whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin (james 4:17) some may feel it is easier just to stay away from this messy trump-clinton election, and perhaps not even vote but the teachings of scripture do not allow us to escape moral responsibility by saying that we decided to do nothing the prophet obadiah rebuked the people of the edom for standing by and doing nothing to help when the babylonians conquered jerusalem: on the day that you stood aloof, on the day that    foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for jerusalem, you were like one of them (obadiah 1:11) i am writing this article because i doubt that many i can’t vote for trump christians have understood what an entirely different nation would result from hillary clinton as president, or have analyzed in detail how different a trump presidency would be in what follows, i will compare the results we could expect from a clinton presidency with what we could expect from a trump presidency the supreme court with clinton as president hillary clinton would quickly replace justice scalia with another liberal like breyer, ginsburg, sotomayor, and kagan this would give liberals a 5-4 majority on the supreme court even without justice kennedy, and 6-3 when he votes with them but that is not all justice ginsburg is 83, and she has had colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, and has a heart stent justice kennedy is 80 justice breyer is 78 a president clinton could possibly nominate three or four justices to the supreme court, locking in a far-left activist judiciary for perhaps 30 or more years she could also add dozens of activist judges to federal district courts and courts of appeals, the courts where 99% of federal lawsuits are decided judicial tyranny of the type we have seen when abortion rights and same-sex marriage were forced on the nation would gain a permanent triumph the nation would no longer be ruled by the people and their elected representatives, but by unelected, unaccountable, activist judges who would dictate from the bench about whatever they were pleased to decree and there would be nothing in our system of government that anyone could do to stop them that is why this election is not just about hillary clinton it is about defeating the far left liberal agenda that any democratic nominee would champion liberal democrats are now within one supreme court justice of their highest goal: gaining permanent control of the nation with a five vote majority on the supreme court, and then relentlessly imposing every liberal policy on the nation not through winning elections but through a relentless parade of one supreme court decision after another even if clinton were to drop out of the race (perhaps due to additional shocking email disclosures, for example), our choice in the election would be just the same, because any other democratic nominee would appoint the same kind of liberal justices to the court abortion on abortion, a liberal court would probably find the ban on partial-birth abortion to be unconstitutional (it was upheld by only a 5-4 majority in gonzalez v carhart, 2007) in addition, the court could find an absolute right to abortion in the equal protection clause of the constitution and then sweep away with one decision most or all of the restrictions on abortion that pro-life advocates worked for tirelessly over the last 43 years, including ultrasound requirements, waiting periods, parental consent requirements, and prohibitions on non-doctors performing abortions voters should not doubt the power of the supreme court to abolish all these laws restricting abortions think of the power of the obergefell v hodges 5-4 decision in june, 2015 it instantly nullified all the work that thousands of christians had done over many years in persuading the citizens of 31 states to pass constitutional amendments defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman but no one is campaigning for such laws or amendments anymore, because it would be futile the supreme court has spoken, and therefore the issue is settled in the political system of the united states we lost – not at the ballot box, but because we had a liberal supreme court that nullified the democratic process regarding the definition of marriage so it would certainly be with any efforts to place legal limitations on abortion nobody would campaign any more for laws to limit abortions, because any such laws would be unconstitutional the legislative lobbying work of pro-life advocacy groups would be totally and utterly defeated millions of unborn children would continue to die religious liberty the current liberal agenda often includes suppressing christian opposition to its views so a liberal court would increasingly nullify rights of conscience with respect to forced participation in same-sex marriage ceremonies or expressing moral objections to homosexual conduct already christians are being pushed out of many occupations florists, bakers, and professional photographers have had their businesses destroyed by large fines for refusal to contribute their artistic talents to a specific event, a same-sex wedding ceremony to which they had moral objections fire chief kelvin cochran in atlanta was removed from his job because of self-publishing a religious book that briefly mentioned the bible’s teachings regarding non-marital sexual conduct, including homosexuality, amidst a host of other topics his situation holds ominous implications for any christians who hold public sector jobs in our military services, many high-ranking officers have quietly been forced to resign because they were unwilling to give support to the homosexual agenda mozilla/firefox ceo brendan eich was pushed out from his own company merely because he had donated money to proposition 8 in california, supporting marriage between one man and one woman this event has troubling implications for christians in any corporate executive role who dare to support a political position contrary to the liberal agenda last year boston urologist paul church, a harvard medical school faculty member, lost his hospital privileges at beth israel deaconess medical center because he had expressed concerns about the medical dangers associated with same-sex activity are my predictions about this kind of loss of religious liberty too grim? the three conservative justices still on the supreme court expressed similar concerns just last month the case concerned a washington pharmacy that has been owned for 70 years by the stormans family, who are committed christians they will likely now be put out of business by the washington state pharmacy board for refusing to dispense an abortion-causing prescription drug on june 28, 2016, the supreme court refused to hear the stormans’ appeal, in spite of the strong dissent written by justice alito (joined by roberts and thomas): at issue are washington state regulations that are likely to make a pharmacist unemployable if he or she objects on religious grounds to dispensing certain prescription medications     there is much evidence that the impetus for the adoption of the regulations was hostility to pharmacists whose religious beliefs regarding abortion and contraception are out of step with prevailing opinion in the state     if this is a sign of how religious liberty claims will be treated in the years ahead, those who value religious freedom have cause for great concern (italics added) christian business owners if clinton appoints just one more liberal justice, it is likely that many christian business owners will be targeted hobby lobby won its 2014 supreme court case (again 5-4), so it was not compelled to dispense abortifacients to its employees, but that case could be reversed (the four liberal justices in the minority, ginsburg, breyer, sotomayor, and kagan, are still on the court) if that case is overturned, it would force hobby lobby out of business, because the green family had said they would shut down the company of 23,000 employees and over $3 billion in annual sales if they lost the decision the implications for other christian business owners with pro-life convictions are ominous these incidents show that it is not an exaggeration to say that, under a liberal supreme court resulting from hillary clinton’s election, christians would increasingly experience systematic exclusion from hundreds of occupations, with thousands of people losing their jobs step-by-step, christians would increasingly be marginalized to the silent fringes of society is withholding a vote from donald trump important enough to pay this high a price in loss of freedom? some christians have even hinted to me that persecution would be good for us but the bible never encourages us to seek persecution or hope for it we should rather work to prevent such oppression of christians, just as jesus taught us to pray, lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil (matthew 6:13) paul did not encourage us to pray that god would give us bad rulers but good ones who would allow us to live a peaceful life: i urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, 2 for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way (1timothy 2:1) christian schools and colleges a liberal supreme court would also impact education christian colleges would likely be found guilty of discrimination if they required adherence to the bible’s standards regarding sexual conduct, or even required affirmation of primary christian beliefs campus ministries like cru and intervarsity have already been forced off of many university campuses following the 5-4 supreme court decision cls v martinez (2010), which upheld the exclusion of the christian legal society from the campus of hastings college of law in san francisco and now california’s equity in higher education act (sb 1146), which recently passed the california state senate and will likely become law, would prohibit christian colleges from requiring students or employees to hold christian beliefs or abide by biblical moral standards regarding sexual conduct, and would prohibit colleges from assigning housing based on a student’s biological sex if a student claimed to be transgender colleges like biola and azusa pacific could not long survive under those regulations with regard to elementary and high schools, laws promoting school choice or tuition voucher programs would likely be declared unconstitutional if they allowed such funding to go to christian schools a tax credit program for scholarships to private schools, including christian institutions, was only upheld by a 5-4 supreme court decision in arizona christian school tuition organization v winn in 2011, and all four liberal justices who voted against it are still on the court another possible target of the liberal agenda would be laws that allow for home schooling, if the secular/ liberal governmental hostility to home schooling in european countries is any indicator churches churches would not be exempt from the impact of a liberal supreme court the court could rule that any school district is allowed to ban churches from renting school buildings on sundays, an action that could severely hinder the work of small churches and church planting in general (this was already the ruling of the second circuit in the bronx household of faith case regarding new york city public schools) and some churches in iowa have now been told that they have to make their bathrooms open to people on the basis of their gender identity if the churches are going to be open to the public at all freedom of speech freedom of speech would be increasingly restricted in the public square in 2014, the supreme court ruled that prayers of visiting pastors who prayed in jesus’ name when they opened a city council meeting were allowed under the constitution, but again it was a 5-4 decision (town of greece v galloway) and all four liberals who wanted to restrict such prayers are still on the court criminalizing dissent another troubling possibility is that liberal activists, once in power, would further entrench themselves by criminalizing much political dissent we have already seen it happen with the irs targeting of conservative groups and with some state attorneys general taking steps to prosecute (!) groups who dare to disagree with activists’ claims about the danger of man-made global warming but my conscience won’t let me vote for donald trump, some have told me but i wonder if their consciences have considered the gravity of these destructive consequences that would come from a clinton presidency a vote for trump would at least be doing something to prevent these things in addition, i think there are several positive reasons to vote for trump the supreme court with trump as president trump has released a list of 11 judges to show the kind of nominee he would appoint to the supreme court a lawyer familiar with many of these names has told me that they constitute a dream list of outstanding judges who would uphold the original meaning of the constitution and would not create new laws from the bench trump has said he would rely primarily on advice from the federalist society, the organization that promotes the original meaning view so strongly exemplified by justice scalia before his death if trump would appoint a replacement for scalia from his list of 11, and probably one or two other supreme court justices, then we could see a 5-4 or even 6-3 majority of conservative justices on the supreme court the results for the nation would be overwhelmingly good such a supreme court would finally return control of the nation to the people and their elected representatives, removing it from dictatorial judges who repeatedly make law from the bench abortion such a court would likely overturn roe v wade and return abortion laws and the regulation of abortion to the states religious liberty a conservative court would vigorously uphold the first amendment, protecting freedom of religion and freedom of speech for christian colleges, christian ministries, and churches such a court would likely overturn the horribly destructive decision in lemon v kurtzman (1971) that changed the meaning of the first amendment and ruled that a government action must not have the primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion (note: not a specific denomination but religion in general) a conservative court would likely declare that the first amendment was only intended to prohibit the establishment of a state-sponsored church or denomination such a decision would once again allow the nonsectarian affirmation of personal belief in god in public schools, would once again allow coaches to pray with their football teams before a game, and would allow visiting clergy to be invited to give a prayer at high school graduation ceremonies it would also imply that nativity scenes without santa claus and buddha should be allowed in government-owned parks and buildings at christmas time it wouldn’t require these things, but would allow them if local officials chose to approve them it would restore true freedom of religion as the first amendment intended it would also protect freedom of conscience for christians who object to participating in abortions, or dispensing abortifacient medicines, or who do not wish to participate in same-sex wedding ceremonies it is also possible that a conservative supreme court would eventually return control of marriage to the states freedom for christian influence in politics significantly, trump has pledged to work to repeal the 1954 johnson amendment to the irs code, which has been used for 62 years as a threat to silence pastors from speaking about political issues, for fear of losing their tax-exempt status this would be a great victory for freedom of religion and freedom of speech in short, a trump-appointed supreme court, together with dozens of lower court judges appointed by him, would probably result in significant advances in many of the policy areas important to christians it would also open the door to huge expansion of influence for the many christian lobbying groups known as family policy councils in various states, especially enabling them to work for further legal protections for life, for marriage and family, and for religious liberty how can we know that trump won’t change his mind? but trump has changed his mind in the past, a politically-minded friend said to me how do you know that he will do what he has promised? maybe he’ll betray you and appoint a liberal supreme court justice my reply is that we can never know the future conduct of any human being with 100% certainty, but in making an ethical decision like this one, we should base the decision on the most likely results in this case, the most likely result is that trump will do most or all of what he has said in the history of american politics, candidates who have been elected president have occasionally changed their minds on one or another issue while in office, but no president has ever gone back on most of what he has promised to do, especially on issues that are crucially important in the election in this election, it is reasonable to think that the most likely result is that both trump and clinton will do what they have promised to do that is the basis on which we should decide how to vote and notice how trump has changed his mind he continues to move in a more conservative direction, as evidenced by his list of judges and his choice for vice president just as he succeeded in business by listening to the best experts to solve each problem, i suspect that he has been learning from the best experts in conservative political thought and has increasingly found that conservative solutions really work we should applaud these changes his choice of indiana gov mike pence as his vice presidential running mate is an especially significant indication that he will govern as a conservative trump could have picked a moderate but instead picked a lifelong solid conservative who is a thoughtful, gracious policy wizard pence is a lawyer and former talk radio host who served 12 years in congress and had significant congressional leadership positions, so he will be immensely helpful in working with congress he is a committed evangelical christian he is a former board member of the indiana family institute, a conservative christian lobbying group in indiana however, the supreme court is not the only issue at stake in this election while i disagree with trump on a few things (especially trade policy), on most important issues, trump will likely do much good for the nation taxes and jobs trump has pledged to cut taxes significantly, while clinton wants to raise them trump is advocating a 15% tax rate for corporations rather than the current 35% lower corporate taxes would lead to business expansion and a massive increase in available jobs and higher pay levels for individual taxpayers, trump favors a top rate of 25%, but for clinton it’s 45% most small businesses file under this individual rate, so once again trump’s lower taxes would result in substantial expansion of businesses and many more jobs finally our economy would snap out of its eight years of anemic growth in my judgment, christians should support lower tax rates that would lead to more jobs, because obama’s economic policies for the last eight years have hurt lower income and low-middle income families the most many can’t even find jobs, and others can’t find full-time jobs those who have jobs struggle to survive with no meaningful pay raises year after year it is no surprise that these are the people who are supporting trump in overwhelming numbers tax rates are also a good indicator of government control higher tax rates mean greater government control of our lives, while lower tax rates indicate greater freedom minorities two of the deepest causes of poverty among minority groups and racial tensions in our country are failing public schools in our inner cities and lack of available jobs trump expressed a commitment to solve these problems at several points in his acceptance speech at the republican convention he pledged to reduce taxes and regulations, leading to many more jobs and he said: nearly 4 in 10 african-american children are living in poverty, while 58% of african-american youth are not employed     this administration has failed america’s inner cities it’s failed them on education it’s failed and on jobs it’s failed them on crime     every action i take, i will ask myself: does this make life better for young americans in baltimore, chicago, detroit, ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child in america?     we will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice by contrast, clinton will bow to the teachers’ unions and oppose school choice at every turn, and she will continue to strangle businesses with high taxes and regulations, preventing job growth the military trump has promised to rapidly rebuild our depleted military forces, but clinton would continue the liberal policy of eviscerating them through denying funding this is dangerous in light of increasing threats from china, russia, iran, and isis borders trump has repeatedly promised that he will finally secure our borders, an urgent need to protect the nation from ever more terrorists and drug smugglers clinton will not do this but will continue to allow in what she thinks will be thousands of future democratic voters isis and terrorism trump has pledged to aggressively attack and utterly defeat isis clinton will continue the anemic obama policy of periodic bombing runs and drone attacks, under which isis has continued to thrive china and russia trump will not let china and russia and iran push us around anymore, as obama has done, with hillary clinton’s support when she was secretary of state if trump is anything, he is tough as nails, and he won’t be bullied israel trump has promised to vigorously defend and support israel, while clinton will most likely continue the obama administration’s criticism, snubbing, and marginalization of israel energy trump has said he will approve the keystone oil pipeline and grant more oil drilling permits leading to lower energy costs and providing thousands of jobs lower energy costs help everybody, but the poor most of all clinton, by contrast, will make fracking nearly impossible and essentially abolish the coal industry, causing energy prices to skyrocket executive orders and bathrooms trump has promised to rescind many of the most objectionable executive orders given by president obama, so he will likely end the compulsory moral degradation forced on us by a liberal agenda, including orders forcing schools to allow boys in girls’ bathrooms and locker rooms, in defiance of the will of the vast majority of americans but hillary clinton would likely perpetuate and expand these policies health care trump will work to repeal obamacare, which is ruining the nation’s health care system, and replace it with an affordable free market system in which companies have the ability to sell insurance across state lines, thus substantially lowering insurance prices especially in those states that currently allow only high-priced cadillac insurance plans but clinton would continue to work relentlessly toward federal government control of our entire health care industry the unprotected trump will finally begin to recognize and protect what wall street journal writer peggy noonan calls the unprotected in america -- people in lower income areas who cannot find good jobs, cannot find good schools for their children, do not feel protected from crime, and find their retirement savings are not enough because for years they have been earning no interest in the bank trump said in his acceptance speech, every day i wake up determined to deliver for the people i have met all across the nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned    i have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves these american citizens recognize that trump has built a business career on listening to experts, solving problems, and getting things done they realize that trump didn’t earn $4 billion by being stupid, and their instinct says that he might be exactly the right person to solve some of the biggest problems in a nation that has for too long been headed in the wrong direction and stuck in political gridlock they may not have college degrees but their old-fashioned common sense tells them that america would be a much better place if we no longer had to be afraid to say merry christmas, or that boys are different from girls, or that islamic terrorists are islamic terrorists they’re sick and tired of being condescended to by the snobbish moralism of the liberal elites who dominate the power centers in our nation that is why they cheer when trump repeatedly violates the canons of politically correct speech they have found in him someone who gives them hope, and they are supporting him by the thousands does character matter? but are you saying that character doesn’t matter? someone might ask i believe that character does matter, but i think trump’s character is far better than what is portrayed by much current political mud-slinging, and far better than his opponent’s character in addition, if someone makes doubts about character the only factor to consider, that is a fallacy in ethical reasoning that i call reductionism – the mistake of reducing every argument to only one factor, when the situation requires that multiple factors be considered in this election, an even larger factor is the future of the nation that would flow from a clinton or a trump presidency to my friends who tell me they won’t vote for trump because there is a chance he won’t govern at all like he promises, i reply that all of american presidential history shows that that result is unlikely, and it is ethically fallacious reasoning to base a decision on assuming a result that is unlikely to happen consider instead the most likely results the most likely result of voting for trump is that he will govern the way he promises to do, bringing much good to the nation but the most likely result of not voting for trump is that you will be abandoning thousands of unborn babies who will be put to death

Article - until now you thought that your love for marijuana was the reason for your munchies, but you’ll never guess what else can actually give you the munchies according to a recent study at the university of chicago, sleep deprivation is also the cause of an increase in the appetite for salty and sweet treats the results are quite substantial, going into the link between obesity and sleep deprivation just by depriving oneself of sleep, one can experience an increase in appetite a lot like the one experienced after getting stoned the results even suggest that it may be a reaction of the body that causes the hunger boost much like getting the munchies after a joint conducting the study the university of chicago invited 14 men and women in their twenties to come and participate in two sessions at the clinical research centre there at the university the researchers controlled the sleep patterns of the participants, meaning that sometimes they slept 7 hours and at other times their sleep was reduced down to only 4 hours and 11 minutes the researchers also controlled how much food and what food was being served to the participants, serving them three meals a day at 9 am, 2 pm and 7 pm after the fourth night of each session, the participants were offered snacks from which to choose they included the kind of snacks we like to indulge in when we are stoned, such as extremely sweet or salty food they found that those that were sleep deprived were far less likely to resist the offer of snacks, and their urge to binge on them was highest in the afternoon right through to the early evening sleep deprivation and obesity it has long been believed that there is a link between sleep deprivation and obesity, and this study can confirm the very reason that they may be linked depriving the human body of sleep interfere’s with its production of hormones that control things like appetite and satiety the scientists conducting this study looked into the kind of hormones that were present in the blood during the study they looked specifically at the hormones ghrelin and leptin ghrelin is the hormone that deals with appetite whereas leptin is the hormone that tells the brain when the body is full of food the endocannabinoid system finally, the scientists decided that they would delve a little further into the body’s craving for food and have a look at the endocannabinoid system, the same system that is excited and activated by using marijuana erin hanlon, who lead the study, found that there was a certain endocannabinoid that was increased after sleep deprivation that could be the cause for the increase in appetite endocannabinoid 2-ag is the chemical that increases the amount of pleasure you feel after you eat, and is an endocannabinoid that also increases after the use of marijuana we know that marijuana activates the endocannabinoid system and causes people to overeat when they are not hungry, and they normally eat yummy sweet and fatty foods, hanlon said sleep restriction may cause overeating by acting in the same manner so it seems that sleep deprivation has a very similar effect on the body in terms of appetite as using marijuana does this means that a future of dealing with obesity through medicine that targets the endocannabinoid system is possible, although much more consideration would be required before moving into it do you experience the munchies when you are sleep deprived? let us know your thoughts on our social media or in the comments section below

Article - nbc a lot of people give millennials flack (*cough cough, baby boomers!*) but this new study shows that millennial couples are actually much better at a certain relationship skill than other generations giphy that’s right! we’re good at something! turns out, according to the second annual td bank love and money study, millennials are better at handling their money and talking about it with their partners the study says that 74% of millennial couples talk about their money weekly, and that those who do report higher levels of satisfaction and happiness in their relationships this is very important, because as many relationship articles will tell you, money and talking about money is one of the highest stressors in relationships, which makes sense whether we like it or not, money affects our everyday lives, from where we live to what we eat it’s hard to keep the romance alive if you’re feeling stressed out about money and you’re afraid of talking to your partner about something that affects the both of you so closely the fact that millennials are good at this feels weirdly like a no-brainer though other generations will often disparage millennials for being too sensitive and open about their feelings, it seems like the benefit of this is millennials are more likely to be transparent and not shy away from tough relationship conversations the survey included 1,902 adults, and included couples of all ages to see how different age groups talked about their money matters most of the couples classified themselves as married or committed millennials were classified as participants who were 18-34 years old among this group, couples were found to be much happier on average than the other demographics, with 49% of the millennial couples saying that they’re extremely happy with their soulmate awww! of course, this survey isn’t a blanket statement about any particular generation or couple, and every individual and couple has their own challenges to face, but it is still awesome to see something positive being said about the millennial age group because, let’s face it, we’re pretty great

Article - the first hint of trouble came just a week after i had knee replacement surgery i was rearranging the bedclothes over my new knee when i realized the down comforter felt like lead, and lifting it felt like doing a bench press that seemed curious, but i was so bent on getting the new knee to work properly that i ignored my sore arms as well as a stubborn stiffness in my neck and hips physical therapy was my focus, and the goal was to get back to my favorite pastime — rowing it had kept me in shape for years, and i was missing early mornings on the potomac months later, i still hadn’t picked up an oar instead, i’d endured anemia, weight loss, fevers, stiffness and sometimes excruciating pain in my hips and legs i felt as if i’d been hit by the flu, or maybe a truck getting out of bed was painful, and getting into a boat again seemed an impossible task the culprit: polymyalgia rheumatica, or pmr, an autoimmune disease that spreads painful inflammation through most of the body’s joints never heard of it? neither had i yet it strikes many older americans, usually in their 70s and 80s, more women than men the afflicted are more often of northern european extraction, indicating to researchers that genetics may be at work fortunately, pmr responds quickly to the steroid drug prednisone the important thing is to recognize, not ignore, the symptoms and seek help i felt better within a day of finally seeing my doctor, being diagnosed and taking my first dose of prednisone in most cases, the condition can be cured, although slowly over months, sometimes years and in some situations it can be complicated by a more serious disease why and how pmr strikes is mysterious, although researchers are looking at viruses or stress as triggers for the disease but undeniably, it is associated with aging, and particularly the aging immune system with the first wave of baby boomers heading into their 70s this year, america’s elderly population will swell, and doctors think there will almost certainly be more cases of pmr basically, polymyalgia rheumatica tricks the immune system into attacking its own body — sending antibodies and immune cells into the hundreds of fluid-filled sacs called bursae that lie throughout our joints and surrounding soft tissue in the healthy body, those sacs — some no wider than a dime, others the size of a silver dollar — keep our joints moving smoothly but when inflamed by pmr, they cause pain and stiffness pmr also impedes the bone marrow’s ability to make red blood cells, causing anemia such an inflammatory response is like a complex cascade, according to marcy o’koon moss, director of consumer health for the arthritis foundation, which counts pmr among more than 100 diseases it focuses on it’s not one thing that happens the cells involved signal each other and communicate, she said many people stricken with pmr confuse their symptoms with aging and just soldier on but as the disease progresses and becomes more debilitating, most figure that something beyond old age is at work phil ringo, 74, of haverford, pa, couldn’t imagine what was wrong four years ago when he began feeling sore and ill i thought i’d gone from a pretty vigorous 70-year-old to an old, old man, he said grandchildren were saying, ‘what’s wrong with papa?’  unable to get out of a chair or into a cab without a struggle, he got no answers from his doctors and when he tried for an appointment with one of the nation’s top diagnostic clinics, they basically said, ‘you’re an old guy’  ringo said  ‘ just get used to it’  he was finally diagnosed and treated after a friend with the disease convinced him to see a rheumatologist actually pmr is famously tricky to diagnose a definitive test does not exist for pmr, said rheumatologist rebecca manno, a johns hopkins school of medicine faculty member and researcher and there are other conditions that mimic pmr, such as rheumatoid arthritis, various infections and even some forms of cancer so the diagnostic process can be torturous leslie kermath, 70, of whitefish, mont, spent almost a month undergoing tests before her doctor felt confident that pmr was causing her pain, stiffness and fever along the way, she got antibiotics for an existing urinary tract infection, was sent to the hospital for a chest x-ray and a cat scan after a test flagged a possible blood clot later she had another cat scan of her abdomen and pelvis, because her hips were terribly painful a lyme disease test came back negative eventually, her blood tests, which showed increasing levels of inflammation, plus her symptoms and age, nailed the diagnosis for kermath’s doctor, who started her on prednisone how many women of caucasian origin, who are older, think they’re just aging and can’t do everything they used to — when they actually have this disease? said kermath, who is an avid hiker most doctors suspecting pmr order several blood tests, almost always two that look for inflammation: the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, known as the esr test, and another for crp, or c-reactive protein doctors also check for antibodies associated with rheumatoid arthritis, to rule out that disease when i finally dragged myself to my internist three months after my symptoms showed up, she immediately suspected pmr given my age — 73 — my symptoms and lab results showing considerable inflammation and anemia, she started me on prednisone and sent me to a rheumatologist after eight weeks of prednisone, my inflammation numbers had fallen to near normal and my anemia was under control my rheumatologist has reduced my steroid dose, but only very gradually because rebounds do happen the hope is that i can be steroid-free — a sign of a cure — sometime in 2017 treating pmr is one of the more gratifying parts of my practice, said my doctor, joseph p laukaitis in my experience, about 95 percent of patients fully recover for a pmr patient, prednisone feels like a miracle drug because it so quickly attacks inflammation and banishes the pain and stiffness but in fact, prednisone is wonderful, wicked in manno’s words the side effects that some people experience are considerable: a thinning of the bones (already a problem for many older women), high blood pressure, weight gain, high blood sugar, insomnia and a distinctive addition of facial fat known as moon face most patients who take prednisone for pmr will also be prescribed a drug to slow bone loss, and that medication, too, has side effects although diagnosing pmr can be difficult, doing so is crucial because a much more serious disease, giant cell arteritis, strikes about 10 to 20 percent of people with pmr giant cell arteritis causes inflammation and damage to blood vessels in the head and elsewhere untreated, it can cause blindness, stroke, even death pmr patients can expect their doctors to look for symptoms of gca: severe headaches, tender scalp, jaw pain and blurred vision any one of those can indicate that the arteries of the head are inflamed the diagnosis often requires a biopsy of one of the arteries in the scalp to confirm inflammation again, prednisone is the treatment much of today’s research into pmr and gca looks for alternatives to prednisone biologics — drugs made from living organisms — hold promise because some can inhibit an inflammatory response as it picks up steam, the arthritis foundation’s o’koon moss said it’s like interrupting a chain reaction there are also promising clinical trials of drugs that treat rheumatoid arthritis and have fda approval for that and they may be effective for pmr, manno said until other drugs become available, prednisone will remain the preferred treatment despite all its of downsides as i face months of treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica, taking smaller and smaller doses of prednisone each month, i hope to avoid remission and eventually regain my strength exercise is key, as it so often is when ill health strikes, so you’ll find me on the stationary bike or walking or, if not rowing, at least beginning to build up stamina on the indoor rowing machine the rowing season of 2016 may have eluded me, but the 2017 season is only months away

Article - but 2016 was the 108th year after their last title, and a baseball is sewn together with 108 stitches this had to be the year it was on wednesday night the cubs beat the cleveland indians, 8-7, in a game 7 for the ages with that victory — yes, the following words are really true — the chicago cubs won the world series but it just couldn’t come easy, couldn’t be won without extra drama the cubs carried a 6-3 lead into the eighth inning, six outs away from a cathartic victory but a double and a two-run home run by the indians wiped out that lead and tied the game, and the deadlock held through the ninth inning then the rain came of course the top of the 10th inning was delayed for about 15 minutes by a deluge but once it let up, the cubs poured it on in the 10th inning, scoring 2 runs to provide the cushion they needed world series mvp ben zobrist hit a go-ahead double, and miguel montero followed up with an rbi single to give the cubs the insurance run they needed it is their third title in the world series, a competition that was introduced in 1903, but this may be the sweetest and hardest-earned championship in the history of american sports making it even more sweet was that the cubs trailed in the series by three games to one upon the final out the players jumped and celebrated on the diamond while thousands of visiting cubs fans screamed joyfully in the stands back in chicago, where fans in the north side of chicago have waited generations for this day, revelers poured into the streets for party that will probably last days in cleveland, a city with its own hard-luck sports history, the wait continues the indians have not won the world series since 1948, and they now own the longest drought in baseball without a title at least the cleveland cavaliers, many of whom were in attendance wednesday at progressive field, broke cleveland’s 52-year span without a major professional sports title by winning the nba championship in june for the cubs, whose long history is riddled with the mythology of billy goat curses, black cats and a fan who was vilified for interfering with a foul ball, theirs is now a history of winning, and their identity changes forever theo epstein knows all about that he is the cubs’ top baseball decision-maker, the man who put together a team and an ethos capable of dashing history’s long reach prior to joining the cubs, epstein was the general manager of the boston red sox in 2004, when that once-accursed franchise won its first world series in 86 years red sox and cubs fans were the longest suffering at the time, and epstein has given closure to both here’s an inning-by-inning breakdown of how the cubs won game 7: top of 1st: fowler crushes one corey kluber is trying to become the first pitcher to win three starts in a single world series since 1968, but he got off to a terrible start when dexter fowler launched the fourth pitch of the game over the center field wall, giving the cubs a 1-0 lead and quieting the indians fans at cleveland’s progressive field it was the first leadoff home run ever in game 7 of a world series after fowler’s blast, kyle schwarber hit a slow grounder to the right side of the infield the indians had the shift on, and francisco lindor, the shortstop, was able to field the ball, but schwarber, running on a reconstructed knee, was able to beat the throw for an infield single kris bryant flied out to right for the first out of the game, and anthony rizzo followed him by flying out to center schwarber, who has three career stolen bases, surprised the indians (and just about anyone watching) by stealing second with ben zobrist at the plate, but kluber was able to get zobrist to pop out to end the inning kluber escaped having allowed just one run and kept his pitch count to 19, but it was hardly the start he was looking for david waldstein: when fowler hit that home run, i almost thought for a moment that rajai davis caught the ball on his jump because it seemed like the entire stadium erupted but it was cubs fans celebrating the home run i have never seen this many visiting fans invade a baseball stadium for such a big game yes, you will see a lot of yankees fans in tampa in may, but this is game 7 of the world series if it is not 50-50 between cubs and indians fans, then it is 40-60 in the section of the bleachers closest to center field, it appeared to be 80 percent cubs fans bottom of 1st: indians can’t match cubs’ start the indians were not able to match the cubs’ strong start to the game leadoff man carlos santana crushed a liner to right on kyle hendricks’s first pitch, but it was right at jason heyward, who easily caught the ball for the first out jason kipnis followed him and flailed meekly at a low changeup for strike three francisco lindor then hit a grounder to second that appeared to be an easy out, but javier baez slipped when trying to throw from his knees, which allowed lindor to reach safely hendricks was able to work around the error by inducing a broken-bat grounder to shortstop from mike napoli to end the inning victor mather: hendricks last pitched in game 3, when he threw 4 1/3 somewhat shaky innings, giving up six hits and two walks but crucially, like the first inning tonight, he gave up no runs david waldstein: terry francona was on a pregame humor jag, making jokes about how he had a dream after game 6 that someone was breaking his ribs he woke up to discover he had been sleeping on the tv remote and it was stuck in his ribcage he also admitted he was dipping pretzels in peanut butter in bed and when he woke up there was peanut butter on his glasses my bedroom looked like a national disaster last night, he said too much info? top of 2nd: kluber settles in kluber got through the inning in an efficient seven pitches addison russell was the offensive star of game 6 with a two-run double and a grand slam, but corey kluber was able to retire him in his first at-bat tonight on a towering popup to shortstop willson contreras then hit a pitch into right-field foul territory that lonnie chisenhall tracked down with little effort jason heyward shattered his bat popping out to shortstop david waldstein: kluber settles down to retire the last six batters, all on fly balls kluber is 12-1 in his last 14 starts at progressive field with a 187 earned run average, including postseason games but this is the only time he has started three times in nine days now it’s up the the indians hitters to get him back even bottom of 2nd: hendricks helps himself the indians had runners reach base twice in the half-inning but got nothing to show for it jose ramirez led off with a grounder that caromed off of kyle hendricks before rolling toward shortstop with the ball coming at him fairly slowly, addison russell tried to barehand it but came up without the ball as ramirez reached first the play was ruled a single rather than an error, as russell likely did not have a play ramirez, however, underestimated hendricks’ ability to hold on runners and got picked off of first lonnie chisenhall singled, but rajai davis grounded into a 5-4-3 double play that was truly impressive considering davis’s speed david waldstein: great play by the icy-veined kyle hendricks to pick off jose ramirez off first but everyone knows hendricks has a terrific pickoff move, so it is kind of unforgivable to get caught that really messed up the inning because chisenhall’s single would have put two runners on base with nobody out the indians were very sloppy in game 6 and cannot afford to do that again, especially with the cubs’ batters getting warmed up in this weather top of 3rd: schwarber runs cubs out of inning javier baez put a big swing on a 1-1 curveball but just missed as he flied out to left for the first out of the inning dexter fowler, he of the leadoff home run, then jumped on the first pitch he saw from corey kluber in his second at-bat, but lined out to right with two outs, kyle schwarber swung into the shift and punched the ball through the crowded right side of the infield but schwarber got greedy and tried to stretch the hit into a double and was thrown out easily at second base by lonnie chisenhall to end the inning victor mather: maybe you aren’t a baseball fan well, akron and toledo are involved in some exciting college football maction on espn2 as you might expect, with an indians world series on the line, the crowd is sparse in akron david waldstein: lonnie chisenhall has had an adventurous world series, but he has a great arm and schwarber never should have challenged it, especially with a surgically repaired knee the shenanigans in the outfield in game 6 were mostly miscommunication and the fault of the center fielder, tyler naquin, and that is why he is on the bench bottom of 3rd: indians get aggressive the indians tied the game thanks to a leadoff double, a well-placed bunt, and a run-scoring single it looked like it could get far worse for the cubs, but kyle hendricks once again worked his way around a few baserunners coco crisp got things started by showing some serious aggressiveness, lacing a ball into the left field corner and legging out a leadoff double hoping to take advantage of the baserunner by playing some small ball, the indians had roberto perez bunt crisp over to third carlos santana then crushed a 1-0 curveball to right for a single, bringing crisp home and tying the game with one run in, jason kipnis hit what looked like a double-play ball to shortstop addison russell flipped to javier baez who dropped the ball, and all runners were ruled safe after a review of the play the defensive miscue set cleveland up with runners on first and second with one out but francisco lindor flied out to left and mike napoli lined out to third to end the threat victor mather: it’s been a tough series for napoli, who was 4-for-19 without an extra-base hit coming into this game, is 0 for 2 tonight and just missed his chance with men on first and second and two outs it was a great advertisement for replay when the terrible out call on santana at second was overturned baez never had it david waldstein: the indians are squaring up on hendricks, so cubs manager joe maddon instructed jon lester to start warming up it was so important for the indians to get back even, which is why they played for the one run some may have wanted the indians to play for the big inning since they seemed to be on hendricks, but francona elected to draw even roberto perez did a terrific job of executing the bunt with rizzo only about 20 feet away from him the cubs, particularly baez, are looking shaky top of 4th: cubs back on top a shallow pop-fly to center and some aggressive baserunning by kris bryant put the cubs back in the lead willson contreras tacked on an rbi double and with a 3-1 lead, chicago had some breathing room for the first time this game bryant led off the inning by working a full-count against corey kluber, and on the eighth pitch of the at-bat he singled on a hard grounder to left anthony rizzo was hit in the right shoulder by a pitch, bringing up ben zobrist with two runners on and no outs he hit a grounder to first that mike napoli fielded and threw to francisco lindor who was covering second rizzo slid in under lindor’s feet, but was ruled out even though lindor’s foot may not have been on the bag that brought up addison russell with runners at the corners and he hit a shallow pop-up to center bryant, knowing that rajai davis does not have a strong throwing arm, broke for home as davis caught the ball and he slid in just ahead of the tag from roberto perez kluber looked like he had contreras on the ropes with two outs, but the young catcher launched a 2-2 curveball into deep center that got over davis’s head zobrist scored and contreras got into second base easily kluber ended the bleeding by retiring jason heyward on a pop-out to shortstop david waldstein: now the indians are making the miscues the cubs scored twice, but it could have been and maybe should have been zero the believelanders are feeling like bereavelanders victor mather: wilson contreras, 1-for-17 coming into tonight, has probably been the cubs’ worst series performer but he comes through to give the cubs the 3-1 lead his rookie season was a key part of the cubs’ fine year; now he adds a big world series rbi bottom of 4th: hendricks works well with a lead kyle hendricks undoubtedly has an incredibly short leash from joe maddon, but he started things off well in the half-inning by retiring jose ramirez on a soft grounder to first base he retired lonnie chisenhall on a soft fly to left for the second out, and got rajai davis to fly to right to end the inning hendricks has thrown just 50 pitches, but it would be surprising if he stayed in the game beyond the fifth inning david waldstein: that was a great inning by hendricks one of the most important things in pitching is the shutdown inning after your team scores hendricks had his cleanest frame of the game and that was vital in terms of solidifying the lead and demoralizing the indians the tension and the excitement that was felt in this stadium just an inning ago has changed perceptibly now it feels just a tiny bit more like a sense of inevitability the cubs seem to be rolling ever since game 5 still a ways to go, though the meat of the indians’ order comes up at least two more times top of 5th: baez ends kluber’s night the cubs extended their lead to four the hard way, by getting one apiece off of corey kluber and andrew miller javier baez took a hard cut at kluber’s first pitch of the inning and crushed a home run, ending the ace’s night terry francona immediately headed to the mound to replace him with miller and start what could be a long night for the indians’ bullpen dexter fowler was the first batter to face miller and was not intimidated by the reliever, stroking a 1-2 slider into left for a single but kyle schwarber gave miller some help by grounding into a 6-4-3 double-play kris bryant came up with two outs and worked a full-count off of miller he somehow ended up drawing a walk on the ninth pitch of the at-bat, after seeing miller’s unhittable slider on six consecutive pitches, and then was running on the pitch when anthony rizzo sliced a single to right bryant, running hard the entire way, was able to score and rizzo reached second after the throw it looked like chicago could do even more damage when ben zobrist hit a ball to deep center field, but rajai davis caught it on the warning track to end the inning miller, who the indians would like to soak up at least a few innings, has already thrown 20 pitches david waldstein: the cubs are really swinging well now in the warm weather, much like they did in the regular season when they scored 808 runs, the most by a national league team at sea level (red sox had 878 runs, the rockies 845) perhaps it was only a matter of time, perhaps it was fatigue among the indians’ pitchers, perhaps it was the addition of schwarber lengthening the lineup even baez, who was 4 for 26 with 4 singles (and 2 errors in game 7) hit a home run off the previously impenetrable kluber they are even hitting andrew miller hard victor mather: if this were the last time the cubs won the world series, the game would be over the decisive game 5 of that series, in 1908, lasted 1 hour, 25 minutes no game in the series lasted more than 2:10 bottom of 5th: lester and ross open door for indians the move to bring in jon lester as a reliever had major implications for the cubs, mostly because of the corresponding move to put in his personal catcher, david ross because of two miscues by ross, the indians scored two runs, cutting chicago’s lead in half kyle hendricks was allowed to come out to start the inning even though jon lester was ready in chicago’s bullpen he got a soft grounder to second from coco crisp for the first out, and struck out roberto perez for out two but hendricks walked carlos santana and his day was done, with lester being summoned to face jason kipnis kipnis hit a soft grounder that was fielded by ross, but the veteran who had just entered the game, threw the ball well out of anthony rizzo’s reach, which resulted in francisco lindor coming up with runners on second and third with two outs lester threw a ball in the dirt that caromed off of ross’s mask and as the catcher tried to go after it, he stumbled, taking so long to recover the ball that both runners scored lester was able to strike out lindor to end the inning, but the game certainly got more interesting because hendricks did not pitch five innings, he is not in line for the victory should the cubs hold on david waldstein: lester (and to a lesser degree, ross) coming into the game was supposed to be the cubs’ madison bumgarner moment, but it looked more like an old-fashioned cubs moment terrific, aggressive base running by jason kipnis to score from second base on a wild pitch he never hesitated and made a beautiful slide under the tag, then got up and punched the air terrible inning by ross, who made the error to allow kipnis to get all the way to second, and then was staggered by the ball when the wild pitch hit him in the mask it feels like a game again top of 6th: ross makes up for mistakes david ross helped erase some of the damage his defense had done in the previous inning by launching a one-out home run to center field that pushed chicago’s lead back to 6-3 jason heyward was the second out of the inning when he grounded out to first, and javier baez struck out to end the inning andrew miller, who looked unhittable earlier in the playoffs, has now allowed two earned runs and gotten just four outs david waldstein: i promise, were not making all this up david ross, who is playing in his last professional baseball game at age 39, who has played on 21 different professional teams at all levels, who is the elder statesman of the cubs, just hit his first world series home run it came after a wild inning behind the plate where he made one error, then got punched in the mask by a bouncing wild pitch that allowed two runs to score is it meant to be? bottom of 6th: indians come up short mike napoli continued his struggles by striking out to lead off the half-inning that brought up jose ramirez, and the third baseman grounded out to shortstop, nearly beating addison russell’s throw to first base that anthony rizzo made a great stretch on brandon guyer came in as a pinch-hitter for lonnie chisenhall and he hit a two-out single to left, but rajai davis grounded out to strand him at first victor mather: oct 14, 1908 bennett park, detroit orval overall outdueled wild bill donovan, and the cubs won the world series they are nine outs away from doing it again top of 7th: cubs chase miller, but fail to score dexter fowler improved to 3 for 4 by singling to start the inning that brought kyle schwarber to the plate in a tough lefty-on-lefty matchup against andrew miller and the ace reliever won the battle, getting schwarber to fly out to left but with that that, miller’s day was over, with terry francona replacing him with the team’s closer, cody allen allen was able to strand the runner he inherited from miller by striking out kris bryant, as fowler was caught stealing after the pitch for a double play while miller is not on the hook for a loss, the game was well below his standards he threw 43 pitches in two and one-third innings, allowing four hits and two earned runs bottom of 7th: lester gets job done coco crisp flied out to left to start the inning and then jon lester ran the count full against roberto perez before walking the catcher on the seventh pitch of the at-bat tyler naquin came in as a pinch-runner for perez before carlos santana hit a come-backer to lester the yips that have been a topic of conversation throughout the playoffs were in play as lester barely looked at second before throwing underhand to first to get one out on a play that would have gotten two with almost any other pitcher on the mound lester did not end up paying for it as he struck out jason kipnis to end the inning top of 8th: allen shuts down cubs a dropped strike three forced a throw to first base, but anthony rizzo was easily retired to start the inning then ben zobrist looked completely overwhelmed by cody allen’s stuff before eventually grounding out to first addison russell watched strikes one and two sail right past him before popping out to first base to end the inning allen has need just 17 pitches to record five outs bottom of 8th: tie game! a day after he was controversially brought into a blowout rather than being preserved for a game 7 appearance, aroldis chapman proved to be human by giving up chicago’s three-run lead in just two batters jon lester had gotten the first two outs of the inning but was pulled from the game after jose ramirez hit a ball up the middle that addison russell couldn’t quite handle brought in for a four-out save, chapman fired seven consecutive fastballs to brandon guyer, topping out at 1003 miles per hour, but it was the last one that cost him as guyer drove the ball to left–center for a double, bringing in a run chapman then imploded, allowing a two-run home run to rajai davis that tied the game and blew the save attempt coco crisp piled on with a single but yan gomes, who had entered the game in the eighth inning, struck out to end the inning chapman ended up throwing 21 pitches and looked like he was completely out of gas despite the radar gun indicating he still had his velocity top of 9th: cubs’ squeeze doesn’t work with new life breathed into the cleveland indians, and rain starting to fall, cody allen walked the leadoff batter, david ross, on five pitches the cubs looked to capitalize by bringing in chris coghlan as a pinch-runner for ross, but he was erased on a force-out when jason heyward grounded to second base heyward then got something started by stealing his third base of the series, and advanced to third on a bad throw from yan gomes michael martinez was brought in as a defensive replacement in right field to help prevent a sacrifice fly from scoring a run, but shaw took care of javier baez by striking him out on an awkward two-strike bunt attempt that brought up dexter fowler, who had been one of the cubs’ better hitters all game, and he laced a ball up the middle that looked like it would get through before francisco lindor chased it down behind second base and threw fowler out at first the indians now have a chance to win the game and the series at home in the bottom of the ninth bottom of 9th: chapman shuts down indians in 9th this game is headed to extra innings aroldis chapman was back out to start the bottom of the ninth despite having looked completely worn out in the eighth he got carlos santana to fly out before ending up in a long battle with jason kipnis he fired kipnis a steady diet of sliders rather than his signature heater and ended up in a full-count before slamming the door with a 974-mph fastball francisco lindor flied out to right, ending the inning victor mather: extra-innings game 7’s: 1924 senators-giants, 1991 twins-braves, 1997 marlins- indians and tonight top of 10th: rain delay, then cubs pounce the cubs are back in the lead thanks to ben zobrist, miguel montero, and a couple questional intentional walks after a brief rain delay, the game resumed with kyle schwarber facing off against bryan shaw the cubs’ designated hitter once again attacked the shift, hitting a grounder through the right side of the infield for his third hit of the game albert almora came in as a pinch-runner for schwarber and the move paid off when kris bryant hit a deep flyout to center and almora showed off some tremendous baserunning ability by tagging up and advancing to second with first base empty, shaw intentionally walked anthony rizzo to get to zobrist the versatile veteran who won a world series with kansas city last year made him pay for it by driving in almora with a double down the third-base line that energized the cubs shaw then issued another intentional walk, this one to addison russell, and with the bases loaded, miguel montero laced a single into left that drove in chicago’s eighth run of the game cleveland brought in trevor bauer with the bases loaded and one out, and the losing pitcher in games 2 and 5 took care of business, striking out jason heyward and getting javier baez to fly out to center field to limit the damagethe indians now have three outs to get back into the game bottom of 10th: indians get a run, but needed two with one out left in the game, the indians closed their deficit to one run but that was as close as they would get as the cubs ended a world series drought that had been going since 1908 the ending was complicated because aroldis chapman was out of the game after throwing 35 pitches in one and one-third innings with their closer gone, the cubs called on carl edwards jr, a 25-year-old right-hander with 41 career regular season appearances and two career saves, to close things out the 2011 48th-round draft pick started things off by striking out mike napoli swinging on a 95-mph fastball he got jose ramirez to ground out to shortstop for the second out that brought up brandon guyer, and edwards walked him on five pitches with rajai davis, who had tied the game in the eighth inning with a two-run homer, due up, cubs pitching coach chris bosio visited the mound chicago allowed guyer to advance to second base without a throw and davis delivered again with a single that drove guyer in and closed the gap to one run joe maddon was not taking any chances and he pulled the plug on his young pitcher, pulling him for michael montgomery with michael martinez due up the left-hander took care of business, retiring martinez on a soft groundball and earning himself a save

Article - every blue-eyed person on the planet is descended from a single european who lived around 6,000 to 10,000 years ago, and who first developed a specific mutation that accounts for the now widespread iris coloration originally, all humans had brown eyes, although genetic variation relating to a gene called oca2 resulted in changes to the amount of pigment produced by different individuals, resulting in the emergence of different shades of brown armed with this information, scientists had for many years searched for the source of blue eyes on the oca2 gene, but without success more recently, a mutation to a separate, nearby gene called herc2 has been identified as the cause of blue eyes this alteration switches off oca2, the gene that determines the amount of the brown pigment melanin that we make it is thought to have first occurred when humans began to migrate from africa to europe, meaning that every person with blue eyes is a descendent of a single early european the fact that every blue-eyed person alive today has this same mutation is pretty compelling evidence for this theory, although the identity of the initial mutant remains something of a mystery to date, the earliest set of sapphire-colored peepers ever found belong to a 7,000-year-old skeleton that was discovered in northern spain naturally, the eyes had long since decayed, however genetic analysis revealed that they would have appeared blue in color

Article - it’s no longer a surprise that cnn, aka the clinton news network, is doing whatever it can to boost hillary clinton for president it even admitted as much on air and its actions in this presidential election continue to remove any doubt one might have had that it’s not to be viewed as an objective news source on sunday, the network edited hillary clinton’s own words in an attempt to paint her as a more steady, politically correct candidate than donald trump — who immediately called the bombing what it was the network falsely quoted trump as saying racial profiling when the candidate said that police should utilize profiling in an effort to combat terrorism trump advocated adopting a system of profiling similar to israel’s you know in israel, they profile, he said they’ve done an unbelievable job, as good as you can do according to a transcript of the interview, trump’s remarks about profiling did not include the word racial trump on fox about bombings: local police, they know who a lot of these people are but they’re afraid of profiling pictwittercom/clzrjkqln3 — bradd jaffy (@braddjaffy) september 19, 2016 well, first of all, i never said that they were muslims, trump said you did you told me muslims i didn’t say that i am saying, you go into profile, people that maybe look suspicious i didn’t say they were muslims but how do they look suspicious? i mean, how? o’reilly pressed i don’t know, trump replied these are experts that’s what they do they profile you go to israel and they should study it because israel has done a phenomenal job about this and they profile and they are not happy about it but they do it and people aren’t complaining about it but we have to profile but i’m not using the term muslim, trump added i am saying, you’re going to have to profile cnn has been running headlines throughout the day that specifically quotes trump as saying racial profiling and the fox news excerpts the network sent out monday evening also framed his quotes as responses to questions about racial profiling cnncom also is using the term racial profiling in its headlines some argued that trump’s remarks implied racial profiling, to which concha replied: memo to world: quotes can’t be based on perceived implication for those attempting to make this argument to me, take a basic writing class — joe concha (@joeconchatv) september 20, 2016 of course, concha is right — but, then again, he’s assuming cnn is still operating as a credible news source which, judging from the comments on twitter, it is most decidedly not does cnn ever report truth anymore???? cnn claims trump called for ‘racial’ profiling (he didn’t) | https://tco/ahfgoeaoog does cnn ever report truth anymore???? #medialies — cathy (@cathy6098) september 20, 2016 cnn, a radical left lying news service at best, stated that trump believes in racial profiling trump never said that more bias from cnn! — ed stack sr (@carenotone) september 20, 2016 @outfrontcnn @juliettekayyem when you use  marks, it’s important to use exact wording in this case racial should not have been inserted — news junkie (@new5junk1e) september 19, 2016 @outfrontcnn when you are paid by the when you are paid by the @hillaryclinton campaign, you do hoax reporting like this: (racial) https://tco/9al3ccsenw — deplorable in chief (@nomoreromney) september 20, 2016 @outfrontcnn cnn is not worth listening to anymore and never will be if it keeps lying to the people — judith purcell (@cynthiatweedle) september 20, 2016 @outfrontcnn @juliettekayyem could you just relay a factual piece of news without embellishments this is why we don’t watch you liars — deplorable me (@crzymom110) september 20, 2016 a spokesperson for cnn did not immediately return theblaze’s request for comment in light of everything, concha had a helpful suggestion for the network: here’s another one: perhaps it’s time for cnn to update its slogan to the most mis-trusted name in news — now that it’s surpassed even msnbc in this regard at least that would be honest [note: this article was written by michelle jesse, associate editor] and a day later, the clinton news network was putting words in trump’s mouth — one word in particularin a telephone interview monday on fox news’ fox and friends, trump said he would knock the hell out of terrorist groups as president he went on to say that police are afraid to do anything to stop terrorist attacks because they don’t want to be accused of profilingin another fox news interview monday, the o’reilly factor host bill o’reilly asked trump if he wants to profile certain muslims trump’s remarks in that interview also did not include the word racial

Article - boston -- when aaron judge was last a normal-sized human being, at about 9 or 10 years old, the player who made him run to his television was barry bonds judge grew up in linden, california, about two hours from what was then pac bell park i was a giants fan and that was the time he was putting up 70 homers a year, said judge, whos now a 6-foot-7, 282-pound right fielder for the new york yankees that was pretty impressive to watch as a kid on wednesday, judge will celebrate his 25th birthday by playing his first game in the yankees-red sox rivalry he will step to the plate as a rookie sensation; his six homers are tied for the second most in the american league but its not just about how many balls he has hit over the fence -- its how far he has hit them judge is challenging the current champ, giancarlo stanton, as the king of the xxxl home run judge’s 460-foot homer on saturday in pittsburgh was the third longest for a yankee since espn started tracking distances in 2009 only alex rodriguezs 477-foot homer in august 2015 and juan mirandas 469-foot shot in october 2009 traveled farther in the past two seasons, judge has three of the four longest yankee homers only chase headley, with a 453-footer in july 2016, cracks the top four headley believes he got all of that one, but he said he and his teammates are eager to see what would happen if everything clicks in perfectly for judge we are all just waiting for that time where everything just syncs up and he gets every bit of it, headley said i want to see him do that he is just a humongous human being that has out-of-this-world power five hundred fifty feet is not out of the question if there is nothing in the way, he is hitting it 550 starlin castro, who is usually in the same batting practice group as judge, has never been big on watching teammates or opponents take bp he remembers being around stanton in the arizona fall league in 2009 and taking a few glances, but besides that, castro said he has never been much of a gawker -- until now he is the first guy, castro said i’m really happy we are in the same group it is really motivating it is really fun to watch we feel like every swing he takes, something big is going to happen matt holliday, on the other hand, has always studied standout teammates and opponents in bp as if thered be an exam afterward its not just tape-measure specialists, but contact guys too holliday looks for any little ingredient he can add to his game, making the 37-year-old slugger as qualified as anyone to weigh in on judge’s power we are all just waiting for that time where everything just syncs up and he gets every bit of it  i want to see him do that he is just a humongous human being that has out-of-this-world power five-hundred fifty feet is not out of the question if there is nothing in the way, he is hitting it 550 there aren’t many guys that can hit the ball as far as him in batting practice, if any, holliday said obviously, stanton is the easy one that comes to mind that i’ve played against barry bonds, too holliday has seen stanton do his damage only as an opponent, while he receives a daily dose of judge he said it might just be familiarity, but he would take judge in a distance contest mark teixeira, who just completed a 14-year career in which he swatted 409 homers, said he used to watch nelson cruz launch some balls in the arlington heat when they were teammates in texas in 2013, teixeira played with stanton in the world baseball classic judge’s power is right there with those two guys, said teixeira, now an espn analyst in 2016, judge struck out in 42 of his 84 at-bats, a performance so bad it made the yankees hesitant to hand him the right-field job in spring training, even with a full winter endorsement from team owner hal steinbrenner in the final days, the yankees finally gave judge the nod over aaron hicks judge has struck out 17 times in 61 at-bats thus far i knew it was going to take some time for him to get used to minor league pitching and big league pitching and really grow into his swing, because he is a big guy and he has to grow into his strike zone, teixeira said the smarter he has gotten about swinging at certain pitches and the more ready he is at the plate, he looks like he is so dangerous right now he is exactly where you would hope he would be when i saw him a few years ago its early, but judge has joined stanton as a player you can’t miss his power, like bonds in his prime, makes it nearly impossible to look away hes the type of player little kids will be running to their televisions to see

Article - we all know it is not easy to avoid the unhealthy stuff, but which food is hardest of all? iulian valentin/shutterstock if processed foods are addictive, scientists have argued, it should be possible to create an addictiveness scale to find the crack cocaine among common meals surprising as it may seem, their answer isnt chocolate we propose that highly processed foods share pharmacokinetic properties (eg concentrated dose, rapid rate of absorption) with drugs of abuse, due to the addition of fat and/or refined carbohydrates and the rapid rate the refined carbohydrates are absorbed into the system, write graduate student erica schulte and dr ashley gearhardt of the university of michigan in plos one the authors characterize addictiveness by factors such as loss of control over consumption, continued use despite negative consequences, and an inability to cut down despite the desire to do so they back up their claims with a study of 504 participants, who helped them assess which foods are hardest to resist although the causes of obesity are multifactorial, one potential contributing factor is the idea certain foods may be capable of triggering an addictive response in some individuals, which may lead to unintended overeating, the authors write to test the differences between foods, the authors had 120 undergraduate students fill out the yale food addiction scale , of which gearhardt was one of the original authors, to determine the individuals substance dependence the students were then shown pictures of 35 common foods, presented in pairs, and asked to say which they considered more likely to produce addiction-like eating behaviors unsurprisingly, foods dense in fat and glycemic load (the amount of carbohydrate in a food multiplied by how swiftly it is converted to sugar) topped the scale as the authors note, drinks with higher concentrations of alcohol are more addictive than their more diffuse counterparts the finding is also consistent with animal studies, which highlight the role of dopamine, our brains pleasure chemical thats often implicated in addiction for instance, rats fed a diet consisting of highly processed foods showed changes to the brains dopamine system thats also seen in response to illicit drugs the respondents were segmented in order to explore how gender and body mass index (bmi) alter the difficulty to resist particular food components gender was not found to be relevant; people with high bmis reported addictive-like attraction to more foods, although the correlation was not as strong as might be expected chocolate came up most often, followed by ice cream and french fries however, the authors were not convinced they had solved the question of which food is the most craving-inducing a further 384 people were asked online to rate the addictiveness of each food on a scale of 1 to 7 using this larger (and more representative) sample, the clear winner was pizza, with a mean score of 401, followed by chocolate and chips sharing second at 373 several other foods – all highly processed and rich in sugar, fat or both – were tightly bunched behind at the bottom of the addictiveness scale came cucumber, carrots and beans even water ranked higher than these strangely, however, while the study included soda and water, coffee was not offered among the 35 choices a match-up between caffeine and pizza’s salt/sugar/fat will have to wait for another time

Article - studies link insufficient sleep to some pretty scary consequences, including an increased risk of stroke, heart disease, diabetes, obesity and even some cancers experts still don’t fully understand why not getting enough sleep is connected to all of these conditions, but new research published this month adds one piece to the puzzle: not getting enough sleep may cause changes to gut bacteria that could fundamentally change our metabolism, affecting a host of bodily systems gut microbiota are the trillions of microorganisms living in our intestines that help keep our metabolism, immune system and other bodily functions running normally, explained senior study author jonathan cedernaes, a sleep researcher at uppsala university in sweden mounting evidence has linked an unhealthy gut microbiota with inflammatory bowel disease, allergies, neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic diseases including obesity and diabetes this new study is one of the first to suggest that not getting enough sleep is one way of making our gut bacteria unhealthy, cedernaes explained  the researchers followed nine individuals who spent two nights sleeping in a lab for eight and a half hours, and then another two nights of sleeping in a lab for only four and a half hours the study included a fairly small number of people, but the strength behind the data is that the researchers were able to compare the effects of varied sleep levels on gut bacteria within the same individuals plus, they only included subjects who reported having gotten consistent sleep and regularly timed meals the week before the study, which meant everyone’s gut bacteria started out at a somewhat typical level the data showed that getting less sleep didn’t necessarily change which gut bacteria the individuals had but getting less sleep did change the levels of specific strains of bacteria the amount of certain types of bacteria decreased by nearly 50 percent ― and that was after only two nights of not getting enough sleep the finding was significant because the wrong balance of bacteria in our gut is thought to be one of the big factors that cause obesity in some individuals, cedernaes explained  what’s more, the ratios of specific strands of gut bacteria observed after individuals had not gotten a full night’s sleep mirrored the levels of the same gut bacteria previously observed in people who were obese or had other metabolic diseases gut bacteria are a crucial, natural component of our bodies, cedernaes said [they] break down fibers that we cannot digest otherwise they can also help us extract nutrients  there was yet another interesting finding from the study the individuals were 20 percent less sensitive to the effects of insulin after having less sleep ― a potential diabetes risk ― compared to the days after the nights they had slept longer  sleep loss has been linked to decreased insulin sensitivity in previous studies, cedernaes said and while his new research did not necessarily suggest the effect was a result of the gut bacteria changes, the link is still an important observation because over time, constant insulin insensitivity is a well-established driver of diabetes  additional, longer studies will be necessary to prove that the gut bacteria changes observed after a few nights of insufficient sleep are linked with the various metabolic diseases thought to be connected to chronic sleep loss, like obesity, diabetes and heart disease but the new data makes a strong case, cedernaes said ― a strong case for catching your zs

Article - (amy cavenaile/the washington post; istock) a new national poll about how american voters perceive donald trump and hillary clinton asked: who between the presidential front-runners has higher moral standards? clinton leads trump in this ambiguous category, 47 percent to 36 percent, according to the results the survey, released wednesday by quinnipiac university, didnt elaborate on what moral encompasses that could help the democratic candidate by making her policy positions appear stronger according to new research, a perception of morality strengthens an argument, giving it more sway than opinions based on tradition or practicality in the study, published in the journal of experimental social psychology, ohio state university doctoral student andrew luttrell and his team hypothesized that the people or causes we most admire share a common trait: theyre connected to our sense of morality, a psychological shield against outside attacks as in: oh, you disagree with me? well, i won’t be swayed because i’m standing up for what’s right the researchers wanted to see if a person’s opinion grew stronger or was more likely to withstand challenges if their viewpoint was declared to be moral so, they set up a series of experiments with three groups of roughly 100 participants [how democratic and republican morals compare to the rest of the world] luttrell and his colleagues gave the first group, all college students, information about a new senior exam policy and asked them to write down their thoughts next, the participants, separated by partitions, received printed feedback on their opinions some were told their ideas on the phony exam policy reflected tradition others heard their ideas projected morality like this: while your thoughts were similar to other students on a variety of dimensions, you seem to have based your thoughts about senior comprehensive exams on morality/tradition more than the average student simply telling someone their attitude was moral, luttrull found, gave it more power compared to those in the tradition group, the participants who heard their thoughts reflected morality were more likely to say they’d sign a petition to support the bogus policy, put their name on a list of students who support the policy and vote in favor of the policy they marked their interest in these actions on a scale of one to nine: in the next two experiments — one with college students and one with a broader sample of adults — researchers asked participants to perform a similar task, this time focused on recycling the group’s consensus: recycling is generally a good thing after respondents wrote down their individual thoughts and took the same nine-point tests, they received feedback on their recycling beliefs some heard their views were practical others heard moral then the researchers tried to change everyone’s mind they slipped respondents a note that said recycling puts more cars on the road and encourages pollution peoples attitudes in the morality group and practicality group didnt significantly differ before they read the anti-recycling message but afterward, a post-test revealed the moral respondents viewed recycling more favorably (756 on a nine-point scale) than the practical respondents (688) those led to believe that their recycling attitudes were grounded in morality were more resistant to the anti-recycling message than those led to believe that their attitudes were grounded in practicality, the authors wrote the takeaway, according to luttrell: framing a cause as moral is a smart tactic for politicians and advocates any issue, it appears, can be viewed through the morality lens, which is why well be probably fighting about politics forever is moral a magic word? he said in some ways, it might be we grow up thinking morality is this thing thats untouchable whats moral is permanent and cannot be challenged fresh off his vatican visit, democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders visits a church in brooklyn and says income inequality isnt just a political issue, its a moral issue (reuters)

Article - today is publication day for tv (the book): two experts pick the greatest american shows of all time, the anthology where matt zoller seitz and i rank the top 100 american sitcoms and dramas ever, and write essays about them, and a whole lot of other things (movies, miniseries, current shows, shows that werent top 100-worthy but were sentimental favorites in some way, etc) you can order it in multiple editions (including an audiobook recorded by matt and me) at amazon, barnes & noble, ibooks, google play, kobo, or your favorite indie bookseller were very proud of the book, and cant wait for people to start reading, but if you still need a taste or two to push you over the buying edge, the ringer ran an excerpt last week featuring part of our explanation for how the top 100 was chosen, along with our joint essay on deadwood, while matts home base at vulture this morning has the essay on our top-ranked show, the simpsons(*) (*) maybe my favorite section of the book – and the favorite of many of the early reviewers – is called the great debate, where matt and i argue out what should get the top pick after we initially wound up with a five-way tie for first place included below is the essay i wrote about a little show called buffy the vampire slayer, which finished in a tie for 25th place – alongside, appropriately enough, fellow classic high school dramas freaks and geeks and my so-called life – among our pantheon of series, coming up just as soon as i get the mustard out buffy the vampire slayer (wb, 1997–2001; upn, 2001–2003) total score: 94 tv show titles rarely bring viewers into the tent, but they can keep them out if you want to give your charming blended-family comedy an ironic name like trophy wife, dont be surprised if your target demographic takes it literally and stays far away (see also terriers, selfie, crazy ex-girlfriend) now, buffy the vampire slayer ran seven seasons, was never in danger of cancellation at any point (it jumped networks after season 5 only because upn was looking to steal a hit from its rival the wb), launched a long-running (and, eventually, very good) spin-off in angel, was beloved by its fans, and helped define the identity of an entire tv network for the short but memorable existence of the wb by any standard you want to measure, buffy was a success except maybe this one: if you tell someone whos never watched it that a show called buffy the vampire slayer is among the best tv dramas of all time, they will roll their eyes at you and change the subject to something less divisive, like immigration policy would a buffy the vampire slayer by any other name have been a crossover hit rather than a cult classic, or won more awards, or simply have been an easier sell to non-fans? certainly, you can imagine wb executives thinking that, which is why they briefly tried to get joss whedon to shorten the title to just slayer whedon held firm, and not just because it might have created confusion between the show and the thrash band that brought the world songs like reign in blood and mandatory suicide he knew that buffy the vampire slayer was the perfect title for his series, because it captured the exact spirit of what he was planning to make you could give it a more serious or distinguished title, but no matter the packaging, the show inside would be about a vapid teenage girl, buffy summers (sarah michelle gellar), who discovered that her destiny was to protect humankind from vampires, demons, and other creatures of the underworld, and a show whose tone shifted rapidly between horror, melodrama, action, and pure comedy the name tells you all of that, and suggests that if youre turned off by it, youre probably not going to like the series to which its applied it was a tonal balance that director fran rubel kuzui didnt even bother attempting with the campy buffy movie adapted from whedons first script the show, though, would have room for many different emotions, all juggled expertly by gellar, anthony stewart head, alyson hannigan, and the rest of the cast it was a series made cheaply even by the standards of tvs fifth-place network, but it almost never seemed ridiculous despite the primitive effects and awkward stunt-doubling for gellar if it wanted to make you laugh at a bit of witty banter (i laugh in the face of danger then i hide until it goes away), it could if it wanted its latest monster to creep you out, it found the most disturbing context possible and if it wanted to make you cry, it was pointless to try fighting it if anything, the exaggerated nature of the various undead villains only made the high school setting more effective, because what is adolescence if not a time when every problem gets blown wildly out of proportion? in the real world, a girl whose boyfriend started treating her badly after they finally have sex wouldnt need to worry that he had turned pure evil, as happened with buffy and her vampire love interest angel (david boreanaz), but it might feel that way for a while and a real teen boy going through the changes of puberty might occasionally imagine himself a monster, but laconic guitar player oz (seth green) actually transformed into a werewolf every time the moon was full turning monsters into metaphors for teenage emotional turmoil was a clever gambit, and one that played particularly well during the shows three seasons set in high school buffy is (by our rankings, anyway) one of the best tv shows ever set in high school, but it wasnt entirely immune to the same problems that eventually beset all such shows when their characters head to college even so, those later seasons still had a knack for landing on the right parallel between the supernatural and the universal, like buffys little sister dawn (michelle trachtenberg) literally being put on earth to cause her problems (which in this case involved the literal end of the world) (those later years also offered some thrilling formal experiments, including hush, an homage to silent horror movies, involving demons who rob people of the ability to speak or scream; the body, a stripped-down outing where buffy confronts the mundane reality of her mothers death from natural causes; and the musical episode once more, with feeling, where a curse forces everyone to express their feelings through song) back to that title whedon once suggested to the new york times, if i made buffy the lesbian separatist, a series of lectures on pbs on why there should be feminism, no one would be coming to the party, and it would be boring the idea of changing culture is important to me, and it can only be done in a popular medium whedon didnt invent feminism in tv storytelling, or even the idea of cross-pollinating it with fantasy and sci-fi tropes (for much of its run, buffy overlapped with xena: warrior princess) but he created one of the finest examples of it, and wrapped it up in a wildly entertaining package that included a name that may have made some potential viewers roll their eyes, but that made enough of them smile and think this might just be a show for them and it was

the researchers suspected that the overestimating of risk reflects moral convictions about proper parenting to separate the two instincts, they created a series of surveys asking participants to rate the danger to children left alone in five specific circumstances: a 2 1⁄2-year-old at home for 20 minutes eating a snack and watching frozen , for instance, or a 6-year-old in a park about a mile from her house for 25 minutes the reasons for the parent’s absence were varied randomly it could be unintentional, for work, to volunteer for charity, to relax or to meet an illicit lover because the child’s situation was exactly the same in all the intentional cases, the risks should also be identical asked what the dangers might be, participants listed the same ones in all circumstances, with a stranger harming the child the most common, followed by an accident the unintentional case might be slightly more dangerous, because parents wouldn’t have a chance to make provisions for their absence such as giving the child a phone and emergency instructions or parking the car in the shade but survey respondents didn’t see things this way at all a mother’s unintentional absence was seen as safer for the child than a mother’s intentional absence for any reason, and a mother’s work-related absence was seen as more dangerous than an unintentional absence, but less dangerous than if the mother left to pursue an illicit sexual affair, they write the same was true for fathers, except that respondents rated leaving for work as posing no greater danger than leaving unintentionally moral disapproval informed beliefs about risks that was true even when the survey explicitly separated the two factors, first asking participants to rate leaving the child from 1 (nothing wrong) to 10 (highly unethical/immoral) people rated the risk higher when they first made a moral judgment people don’t only think that leaving children alone is dangerous and therefore immoral, the researchers write they also think it is immoral and therefore dangerous that is, people overestimate the actual danger to children who are left alone by their parents, in order to better support or justify their moral condemnation of parents who do so the result is a feedback loop that increases the legal and social penalties for leaving kids alone and reinforces the belief that even the briefest parental absence amounts to child abuse these beliefs don’t just affect busybodies they lead police, prosecutors, judges and jurors to overestimate risks take what happened to julie koehler: she left her three daughters, ages 8, 5 and 4, watching a video in the minivan while she went into an evanston, illinois, starbucks for three minutes when she saw a police officer talking to the girls through the open windows, she thought nothing of it, until he returned and her 8-year-old started crying she rushed out of the store, and the situation deteriorated from there koehler is a public defender in the homicide division she knew she hadn’t broken any laws and she had two lawyers, her husband and mother, to call to the scene she wasn’t arrested, but the state nonetheless initiated a child-abuse investigation officials interrogated the kids, required a pediatrician’s exam, demanded that koehler supply two references, and questioned them and her about her mental health, including whether she was on any medications what if i was taking an anti-depressant? would that have affected the outcome of the case? she asks the investigation determined that the report of abuse was unfounded but it taught koehler the hazards of leaving your kids for even the briefest time under the safest circumstances the real stranger danger doesn’t come from would-be kidnappers it comes from people who think they’re doing good

emergence of al-qaeda in iraq, morphing into its present state as a result of the wars in libya and syria can things get any worse? not only can they, we should expect new wars in the middle east if hillary rodham clinton, the presumptive democratic candidate for president is elected next november even a glance at her record and the neoconservatives’ enthusiasm for her presidency indicate how

afghanistan ordered by president obama, and has taken an extremely hawkish stance toward russia and as secretary of state she supported massive sale of advanced us weapons to saudi arabia and its allies in the persian gulf area, all reactionary dictatorships, the same weapons that are being used to attack yemen the only accomplishments that she is still lacking are starting a war with iran and invading syria if she is elected president, she may get to add both to her impeccable track record of war, bloodshed and destruction and in the process spark world war iii, if it has not already begun as a result of us policy toward the middle east clinton considers syria and iran closely linked in fact, most objective experts and analysts do believe that the war in syria has a lot to do with iran, its strategic alliance with syria, its use of syrian territory to help the lebanese hezbollah, and more generally what the sunni arab regimes of the region consider as the shiite crescent – the alliance between the shiites in iran, iraq, syria, saudi arabia, bahrain, and lebanon so, before the war began in syria in 2011, she supported secret negotiations between israel and syria as a way of separating the latter from iran but, the negotiations failed, as they always do, due to israel’s intransigence thus, to her destroying syria in order to topple bashar al-assad became the pathway for attacking iran, which she views as necessary for israel’s sake, as the clintons have deep connections to israel and its lobby in the united states her advocacy of direct us intervention in syria began carefully one of her top aides, ann-marie slaughter who was director of policy planning at the state department from 2009-2011, published a piece in the new york times in february 2012 advocating foreign military intervention in syria clinton herself became a leading force in putting together the so-called friends of syria group, consisting of several western nations and the very arab regimes that despise iran and have played the most important role in keeping the war continuing in syria, namely, saudi arabia, qatar, united arab emirates, and jordan, as well as turkey the group is similar to the contact group on libya, also known as friends of libya, which consisted essentially of the same countries and was created to help the opposition forces in libya in 2011, and we all know what that help led to but, hillary clinton has gone even further in an interview with the cnn she claimed syria and iran (as well as russia) helped creating the daesh, saying, isis was primarily the result of the vacuum in syria caused by assad first and foremost aided and abetted by iran and russia despite clinton’s skepticism about a nuclear agreement with iran, p5+1 and iran signed the historic nuclear agreement in july 2015 after iran made many significant concessions after the nuclear accord the hope was that rapprochement between iran and the united states would slowly develop at the same time, it became crystal clear to practically everyone, from the president and his vice president joe biden, to even the editors of the new york times that saudi arabia and its allies are the main sponsors of terrorism in the middle east they are also raping the poor nation of yemen with us logistic and military support yet, hillary clinton is still singing the same old worn out songs and espousing the same failed policies toward iran: more sanctions, more military threats, and more diplomatic pressure this is of course neither new nor surprising along with the neocons, the clintons have always been iran’s number one enemy in the us political establishment the cliché in the west is that it is iran that does not want improved relations with the west that is not true, at least not when iranian reformists, moderates, and pragmatists have been in power three times over the past 20 years the iranian reformists and moderates have tried to improve the relations between their nation and the united states, and in each case the clintons have either prevented the rapprochement or, as it is happening now, try to scuttle it in may 1995 former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani, considered a pragmatist then but allied firmly with the reformists now, made a gesture of reconciliation toward the us by awarding the american oil company conoco a major contract to develop a large offshore oil field in the persian gulf, although a european oil company had actually won the bidding for the contract but, instead of responding in kind, bill clinton imposed total trade embargo on iran in 1996 as part of his absurd, and ultimately failed dual containment policy according to which both iran and iraq were supposed to be contained and put in a strategic box then, in 1998 former reformist president proposed dialogue among civilizations as a cautious approach to open dialogue between the two nations not only had khatami won the presidential elections in 1997 in a landslide, his allies would sweep the first nationwide elections for city councils in fall of 1998 and for the majles[iranian parliament] in february 2000 but, once again, instead of making a major gesture toward iranian democrats by lifting the economic sanctions, or at least suspending them, bill clinton announced that iran could export pistachio, carpet and caviar to the united states, as if that would impress any iranian the clinton administration claimed that it was seriously seeking formal dialogue with iran, but khatami was not interested, unless major sanctions against iran would first be lifted, which were not after hillary clinton was elected a senator from new york in 2000, she supported every resolution by congress imposing unilateral sanctions on iran all such sanctions are illegal because they have not been approved by the united nations security council as secretary of state mrs clinton took the lead in putting together a coalition of western nations that imposed the toughest sanctions in history on iran the sanctions hurt the lives of tens of millions of ordinary iranians now that she is running for president again, clinton’s campaign brags about her role in putting in place the sanctions, as she does in her memoir as secretary of state, hard choices in an interview with abc in 2008, when mrs clinton was running for president, she was asked what she would do if iran attacked israel with nuclear weapons, to which she responded, i want the iranians to know that if i’m the president, we will attack iran in the next 10 years, during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on israel we would be able to totally obliterate them (emphasis mine) iran did not and does not have nuclear weapons and clinton knew it, but she did not even declare that if iran attacked israel, which is highly unlikely if not impossible (unless israel attacks first), she would defend israel her threat to obliterate iran, a very large country, can be accomplished by only one means: attacking iran with nuclear weapons even though clinton’s most important accomplishment as secretary of state, namely, attacking libya under the guise of humanitarian intervention, which was nothing but naked military aggression, has been a total catastrophe, in interviews with the bbc and voice of america in october 2011 she claimed that iran is moving toward a military dictatorship while the leaders of iran’s green movement, a democratic and peaceful movement that emerged after iran’s fraudulent presidential elections of june 2009, rejected any us help, clinton said in the interviews that if they had asked for help, the us was prepared to help them the way it helped libyan rebels in other words, the us would have tried regime change in iran although hillary clinton claims that she supports the nuclear accord with iran, she never misses a chance to demonize and belittles iran in a speech at the brookings institution last september, clinton declared, i don’t see iran as our partner in implementing this agreement i believe iran is the subject of the agreement (emphasis mine), as if iran is a banana republic that is subject to us will in an article in thejewish journal she threatened iran again, we have to send iran an unequivocal message there can be no doubt in tehran that if iran’s leaders violate their commitments not to seek, develop, or acquire any nuclear weapons, the united states will stop them they will test our resolve with actions like their provocative ballistic missile test, for which we should impose new sanctions designations they need to understand that america will act decisively if iran violates the nuclear agreement, including taking military action if necessary (emphasis added) clinton’s rhetoric regarding iran, even after the nuclear accord, only creates trouble for the administration of president hassan rouhani in the midst of his fierce power struggle with tehran’s hardliners by taking a hardline toward the nuclear agreement and improved relations with iran, hillary clinton is a strong ally of iranian hardliners who also do not want any rapprochement with the united states in addition to constantly demonizing iran, hillary clinton is always looking for ways of imposing new economic sanctions on iran to carry favor with the pro-israel lobby and its rich donors for example, it is well known that iranian hardliners were, and still are opposed to the nuclear agreement with p5+1, just as the neocons and the extreme right in the united states opposed it and still do so, the iranian hardliners have tried to demonstrate their unhappiness with the nuclear accord, and one way of doing so, in addition to creating other problems for the rouhani administration, has been testing ballistic missiles the missiles are purely defensive weapons meant to deter israel and the tests, unlike what the opposition to the nuclear accord in the united states claims, do not violate un security council resolution 2231 that was issued after the nuclear accord to endorse it despite these glaring facts, after the missile tests, mrs clinton quickly called for new sanctions against iran during the primary season the clinton campaign slammed senator sanders’ suggestion that the us and iran should have closer relations jake sullivan, hillary clinton’s senior policy adviser, said on january 21, this proposal [by sanders] to more aggressively normalize relations and to move to warm relations with iran not only breaks with president obama’s policy, it breaks with the sober and responsible diplomatic approach that’s been working for the united states this is not surprising hardliners everywhere are allies of each other and feed one another, and clinton and tehran’s hardliners are no exception not only does hillary clinton not want improved relations with iran, she has been itching to find an excuse start a war with that nation and, thus, she constantly demonizes iran but, in addition to demonizing iran, she also lies about that nation brazenly for example, similar to benjamin netanyahu she always refers collectively to iran, daesh and the palestinian group hamas, as if they are allies iran has been fighting daesh in both syria and iraq iran cut off its financial aid to hamas after that organization refused to back bashar al-assad in syria there is absolutely no relation between hamas and daesh in fact, many senior israeli officers have made it clear that they prefer hamas to run gaza, because the alternative would be either daesh or one of the terrorist groups allied with it, why is mrs clinton so anti-iran? i can think of at least two reasons one is that hillary clinton has never given up her imperial ambitions to reshape the middle east, because she believes in american exceptionalism and always speaks about american global leadership, which only means world dominance she sees iran as an impediment to her ambitions for the middle east why does she want to reshape the middle east and possibly change the borders? this brings us to the second reason for her being anti-iran clinton is an israel firster anything that she wants for the middle east is intended for making the region as safe for israel as possible clinton is not bothered by the fact that israel is run by the far right with expansionist ambitions to see this, all one has to do is listening to her speech at the annual meeting of aipac in march when asked during her first democratic presidential debate last october which enemy are you most proud of, hillary clinton included the iranians among them this was truly disturbing was she talking about 80 million iranians? if she meant the iranian government, why did she not say so? why did she not make it clear that she meant, for example, tehran’s hardliners? apparently, hillary clinton considers all iranians as the enemy, which is truly disturbing those who argue that we should vote for clinton as the lesser of two evils in the upcoming presidential elections are truly misguided yes, for decades if not longer elections in the united state have been reduced to choosing between bad and worse but, not this time hillary clinton is simply as terrible as donald trump, if not worse expect new catastrophic wars in the middle east, especially one with iran, if she is elected this article (expect hillary to do this

Article - david amster-olszewski has a distinctive perspective on the future of energy he’s the ceo and founder of sunshare, a company that installs community gardens of solar panels so even those unable to have a solar panel on their roof can access solar power one word to describe how he sees the energy industry of the future is choice what we’re starting to see is this shift toward consumer preferences actually being an important factor in this industry for the first time, says david it’s as simple as the product we’re bringing to customers, which is giving people the power to choose where they want to get their energy sunshare started in colorado with a two-acre project, and has now spread to minnesota and new york the gardens range in size from one megawatt to five megawatts, and cover between six and 30 acres of land local utility companies purchase energy from the solar garden, and then community members subscribe to the solar garden and receive solar credits on their utility bill we think we can change the energy industry because demand for a type of power has never really driven the electricity industry in this country what you had was more supply side determinations based on regulatory processes and monopoly utilities, says david our hypothesis and what we’ve proven is that people will change, and people making choices with their pocketbooks drives change solar energy is beating the costs of natural gas plants across the country right now, even the operating costs, and that’s not even including the volatility premium you’d have to price in to a natural gas plant you’d be building for 20 years you’ve got the economic plus the environmental benefits that really make solar a win-win for both utilities and consumers yet change is not always easy, and david has had to work against systems that have been in place for a century as he pioneers a new way of providing power the challenges are working with utilities that aren’t really built for this new operating system that comes with the renewable and distributed energy infrastructure, so having solar and wind farms around the country near the source of where people are consuming energy that’s not how this country has looked at consuming energy previously you’re basically going from one of those old dos operating systems to windows xp it’s a completely different experience, he says that’s really what we’re talking about in terms of the difference in how energy is transferred across the grid, managed across the grid, consumed across the grid, and tracked across the grid it’s that much of a difference so you’re working with this industry that’s built on a dos platform with dos economics changing that mindset is probably one of the biggest challenges, but economics are driving that; it’s a powerful force as he pursues making solar power affordable and available, he’s at a unique vantage point to predict how the energy industry will ultimately change in addition to the choices available to people, david predicts it will be easier for utility companies to monitor their energy output i think you’re going to be able to track energy usage so that you can much more closely match energy production to energy demand previously power plants might be operating consistently 24 hours a day because they really can’t be shut off you can’t just turn off a coal-fired power plant for four hours in a day you end up burning a lot more energy, a lot more coal, for example, at nighttime than is actually being used on the system, he says so you’ll see a lot less waste in the system, which overall will significantly reduce our energy consumption as a country energy of the future will also be more reliable and secure it’s going to be terrorist-proof: you’re not going to have single points of weakness on the system where terrorists can disrupt our access to electricity by that, i mean localized, renewable energy creates backup support systems on the grid that don’t fail with natural disasters or terrorism, says david

Article - can humans become pregnant while already pregnant? its possible, but rare can a woman get pregnant when she is already pregnant? in other words, can she have two foetuses in her uterus at different stages of development? the technical term for this is superfetation in humans, its possible, but its very uncommon two thousand years ago, that great greek thinker aristotle wondered about this very topic, specifically as regards the hare aristotle noticed that when a hare gave birth, quite often the offspring in a single litter would fall into two distinct classes: there would be a bunch of full-sized robust baby hares, and another bunch of scrawny frail baby hares it was, he thought, as though the mother hare had become pregnant and then — while pregnant — had conceived a second time there was nothing fundamentally wrong with the smaller, weedy offspring, aristotle thought, apart from the fact that they had not spent enough time growing in their mothers uterus and he was right normally in humans, there are three separate barriers to stop a female from getting pregnant again if she is already pregnant the first barrier is the hormonal changes after conception that stop the ovaries from releasing another egg dr karl explores the uncommon phenomenon of superfetation the second barrier is physical: a mucous plug almost immediately after conception, a plug forms in the cervix and sits at the top of the vagina this plug stops any other sperm from entering the uterus and getting to a second egg third, there are physical and chemical changes that happen to the inner lining of the uterus in pregnancy these changes usually stop a second fertilised egg from being able to attach to the uterine wall even so, some animal species manage to get around all these barriers about 1 to 2 per cent of all pregnant cows show signs of being potentially fertile while they are already pregnant, and superfetation has been observed in animals such as the mouse, the rabbit, the sheep, the buffalo, the mink, and the australian swamp wallaby superfetation is extremely uncommon in humans, with fewer than a dozen cases in the medical literature a typical case is that of julia grovenburg, a 31-year-old woman from arkansas ms grovenburg and her partner had been trying to get pregnant for three years, and had begun to consider adoption of a child but amazingly she conceived twice in 2009 — a few weeks apart the daily mail claimed that, in a desperate and final attempt to have children of their own, the couple had given it one last try this is a curious use of the word desperate possible superfetation has been observed in cows i might be old-fashioned, but it seems odd to me to regard sexual intercourse as a desperate and final attempt to get pregnant it makes you wonder what measures they tried before they got desperate anyhow, ms grovenburg was pregnant — but then things went odd: the ultrasound showed two independent babies, each living in their own separate amniotic sac but one was much larger and more developed than the other as the ultrasounds scans mounted up for ms grovenburg, both foetuses seemed to be growing normally and healthily, though it appeared as if one foetus had simply started a few weeks after the other in other words, mrs grovenburg had conceived a second baby a few weeks after becoming pregnant with the first now we dont have rock-solid proof that this is what happened we would need a series of ultrasound scans to prove that these scans would need to document a series of changes — starting with no foetus or amniotic sac in the uterus, and then a single foetus in its single amniotic sac, and a second foetus appearing in their own second amniotic sac after a few weeks people dont usually get a series of ultrasound scans immediately after sexual intercourse, so this kind of hard data is difficult to get but there is some evolutionary biology behind superfetation female european brown hares frequently have a second pregnancy while already pregnant this means females can have about one third more offspring in each breeding season for humans, more babies each breeding cycle isnt always a plus — especially if youre trying to get a good nights sleep if you have inside knowledge of a topic in the news, contact the abc its a phenomenon known as superfetation, and while its rare, it can happen

Article - facebook messenger weaves chatbots with friends facebook is a bit like that big dog galloping toward you in the park, said the late new york times journalist david carr, bemoaning the influence the social media giant has had on publishers’ distribution—and, in turn, monetization more often than not, it’s hard to tell whether he wants to play with you or eat you now, facebook has an even bigger, faster-encroaching dog for publishers to grapple with: messaging bbc uses viber to tell the story of a real kidnapping in mexico by having its editorial staff role play facebook’s messenger and whatsapp products now process a combined 60 billion messages a day worldwide as an emerging medium, messaging is bigger than even facebook it’s the most widely used smartphone feature in the us, and it’s already taking a bite out of social media as of the beginning of this year, according to business insider’s intelligence reports, the top four messaging apps—wechat, viber, facebook messenger and whatsapp—have already eclipsed the top four social networking apps—twitter, linkedin, facebook and instagram—in their aggregate monthly active users this rapid growth is also poised to leave the rest of the mobile app ecosystem in the dust according to emarketer, more than 14 billion consumers were using messaging apps by the end of 2015; that’s 75% of all smartphone users and an increase of 316% over the previous year and that number has grown rapidly since as of this week, facebook messenger has already amassed 900 million users on its own at a time when most smartphone users download zero apps per month and a quarter of all downloaded apps are abandoned after a single use, users are spending an average of 200 minutes a week on whatsapp so, this is clearly a medium we should pay attention to but how should publishers and news organizations play with it? to answer that question, we need to grasp what it is about messaging that’s allowed it to become pervasive, so that we can gain a better understanding of how content could fit comfortably on it why messaging is different text messages—the ubiquitous kind that are primarily used by consumers on their mobile devices—more aptly mimic the fluidity of human communication than other digital forms the technology embedded in text messages sits in the background versus in your way for instance, you can respond to a text message immediately or whenever is most convenient for you it doesn’t require conversing parties to be available simultaneously, as a phone call or video chat does, nor does it assume that people would rather correspond asynchronously, as with email text messages also offer a better representation of a person’s relationships by focusing on long-term conversations messages are typically organized in a list form that is automatically updated every time you interact with it the people you talk to most frequently and recently at any given moment surface at the top of that list you don’t have to manually program and repeatedly update the list in the way you may have back when you added your friends and family members to phone-based speed dial, or in the way you need to tell facebook which friends are closer to you than others, a status that can change from time to time also, in the context of the text message thread, a message you receive carries the expectation that you will engage with it in this fundamental way, messaging differs from push notifications or alerts, which instead serve to simply broadcast information the expectation with an alert is that as soon as you interact with it, it goes away as soon as you interact with a text message, it sits at the top of your messaging list this focus on fluidity and conversation allows text messaging to more adequately fit the demands of our dynamic circumstances and relationships than other forms of digital communication to successfully engage with the medium, therefore, publishers should harness these unique features that have made messaging powerful cost center or revenue stream? publishers will also need to know if messaging offers a clear path—or at least a dimly lit one—to monetization in order to see how widely they can experiment and whether this new outlet will represent a new cost center or revenue stream while it’s too early to tell, there are a few unique related aspects that are potentially promising by virtue of it living on your phone messaging is a natural access point to both your social and mobile data by virtue of it living on your phone, natively harnessing an ongoing memory of your conversations and serving as the best digital representation of your relationships, messaging is a natural access point to both your social and mobile data for instance, facebook messenger is aware of your identity, social graph, location, conversation history and more this ongoing memory—coupled with the fact that users are already becoming increasingly comfortable with making payments on their mobile devices—positions in-messaging payment services as potential facilitators of paywalled content once they set up their relationship with a service like stripe or facebook messenger’s native payments feature, users can theoretically convert to paying subscribers with a quick text versus detailing their personal and financial information at every point of sale this could make payments via messaging more effortless than they are to facilitate via websites this unique access to data also allows for messaging to support personalized and perhaps more appropriate user interactions with sponsors as opposed to simply serving banner ads that may feel disruptive to the conversational experience, messaging apps have the potential to serve offers based on a user’s preferences in this vein, facebook messenger revealed that it will be experimenting with sponsored messages since preserving a personal tone is essential to the messaging experience, publishers and advertisers will likely explore this area cautiously, so we will hopefully see more intuitive exercises in commercialization using this new medium for instance, since facebook messenger may already know of some services and companies you like via the data you have fed the parent platform over time, it will probably prioritize facilitating messages between you and those companies you already trust and may want to hear from on the flip side, if an advertiser gets too noisy or feels irrelevant, you can easily block them from messaging you again editorial experiments before monetizing it, publishers need to test the medium itself the most obvious, lowest-friction way to experiment within messaging platforms is to simply focus on them as new distribution points for content that’s already been created predictably, many big publishers have dipped their toes in this way; for instance, the economist and buzzfeed both experimented with the messaging app line to push out news alerts that include links back to their respective publications for the full stories setting up this type of experience is similar to using twitter to alert users; simply create an account on a text messaging app, allow users to subscribe to that account and either manually send out notifications or set up automated news alerts while easy and cheap to fulfill, this use case renders an experience that’s closer to that of a billboard than a conversation, which is why the economist deemed the exercise a brand building initiative since the user can’t really interact with the message, at best this experiment’s results will be commensurate with the effort, and at worst, they may mirror punishment by way of a slow release of the entire works of shakespeare over text in taking a step towards experimenting with the conversational aspect of messaging, some publishers have run efforts like live editorial commentary in this paradigm, a publication’s staff members chat amongst themselves—for instance, discussing a news event—and the subscribed audience can follow the conversation as it unfolds and maybe even participate in the discussion the guardian hosted a whatsapp chat alongside the gop debates in december, and the huffington post ran a similar effort around various news topics on viber another related use case involving editorial conversation is acting out a script the bbc recently used viber to tell the story of a real kidnapping in mexico by having its editorial staff role play using actual quotes from people involved in the case as in the news alert use case, for this type of experience publishers need to create accounts on messaging platforms and build their subscriber bases but this experiment also calls for extra time commitments from editorial staffers to write scripts and/or run the live chats it can also require an outside trigger event, like a debate, to be happening concurrently on another screen that chat subscribers are also tuning in to chatbots while potentially engaging, hosting live conversations on messaging apps is resource-intensive and limited in its interaction with end users, as editors can’t scale themselves to respond to every user’s question or comment this problem has prompted publishers to experiment with chatbots to allow users to interact with the news in the context of text messaging, a bot is an account operated by software in place of a person given a pre-prescribed set of rules a human editor makes, a bot can theoretically respond to a user in a way that mimics a human response quartz recently released a news app that sends a user a blurb about a story and employs a bot to ask the user to select between reading more about that specific story or moving on to the next story forbesbot on telegram cnn created a similar bot on facebook messenger using the just-released send and receive api, and publications like forbes and techcrunch have created bots on the messaging platform telegram using bot creator chatfuel purple is yet another similarly powered bot that texts users with election news, allowing them to delve deeper into a subtopic within a message by texting back a pre-designated keyword (eg, kasich) contained within that original bot message powering these experiences relies on a diligent, combined effort of developing a bot (frequently via a third party) and dedicating editorial resources to writing short, conversational prose out of published stories in its current state, the news bot is a novelty that more closely mimics the experience of interacting with an automatic phone teller than talking to a human journalist the seemingly endless loop of repeatedly hitting buttons or expressing keywords in order to get a response to a specific question can leave a user quickly fatigued the underlying problem is that bots are essentially formulas created to handle a limited set of scenarios within a pre-defined framework, and they haven’t gotten to the point where they can manage massive banks of scenarios smoothly enough to handle every-day decisions this problem isn’t so different from why, with self-driving vehicles, we’re clearly pretty close to making a car that can handle highway driving with no human input, since the range of possible events is pretty small, says benedict evans, a partner at the venture capital fund andreesen horowitz but driving in central rome or moscow is an entirely different matter that needs an entirely different level of decision-making: what does that hand gesture mean? to handle the multitude of scenarios presented in an open-ended system like chat, we need a far more sophisticated bot that can scalably and quickly run decisions based on all potential user inputs, a form of artificial intelligence (ai) that can more holistically mimic human conversations the current limitations of chatbots haven’t stopped messaging platforms like telegram, kik and facebook messenger from launching their own bot ecosystems, nor have they hindered publications like the washington post from creating their own homegrown bots the promise of true ai—an interaction framework that would allow news providers to offer each of their users a bespoke conversational experience at scale—is far too meaningful to give up on that’s why, in tandem with releasing its limited-scope send and recieve api for bot creators, facebook has also released bot engine, a system based on machine learning that can pave the way for more complex scenarios, like handling different variations of the same user questions ai-powered news looking to the future, you can imagine an ai-based chatbot that truly comprehends intention behind language, a bot that you can have long-term discussions with about the news the way you would with a well-informed friend this intelligent bot could also fulfill the promise of voice-based products like apple’s siri or amazon’s alexa it would both learn who you are and understand the content within stories enough to surface news you’d likely be interested in, whether or not you explicitly told it you were—or perhaps before you even knew you were this type of bot would be promising in the sense that it may change the current rut we are in with digital news, a relationship which twitter’s co-founder and medium founder ev williams aptly describes as stuck in  the idea that [the media people consume] is what they want will writers soon share the kind of power and influence over creating digital user experiences that graphical designers now have? while we don’t currently have ai-powered news, we can start paving the way for it by crafting the right type of conversation-based frameworks for it what’s exciting about this for writers and journalists is that the archetype text messaging is based on—broadly described as conversational user interface (ui)—is largely driven by exposing functionality through language; ‘designing’ a killer chatbot, therefore, relies at least as much on using the right kind of language as it does on a creating a great graphical user interface will writers soon share the kind of power and influence over creating digital user experiences that graphical designers now have? unlike websites and mobile apps, which rely heavily on navigational design and buttons to express breadth of coverage and direct users to the content they may be interested in, with chatbots all of your features need to be reachable solely through words—so picking the right thing to say, and the tone of your dialogue with the user, is crucial, explains matty mariansky, who created meekan, a calendaring bot for enterprise messaging platform slack this new role of language can empower writers to design experiences for messaging-based services for instance, mariansky hired dedicated scriptwriters to come up with more than 2,000 sentences to handle a meeting request while mark zuckerberg argues that the best messaging experiences will combine conversational and graphical ui rather than rely on words alone, the role of language as a form of user experience design becomes even more important when we start designing our bots to be flexible enough to work with both text and voice when the bot is stripped of a screen altogether, as with services like siri and alexa, language is the user experience it wouldn’t be far-fetched, therefore, to imagine a scenario in which journalists extend their writing skills and editorial judgment to not only cover stories, but design the channels through which these stories are distributed these writers may also be critical to the development of an entirely new bot-influenced lexicon, introducing new words and phrases into our vernacular and, through them, new ways for users to interact with the news this type of shift—the ability for writers and publishers to design digital experiences with the same skill set used to hone their journalistic craft—could profoundly change their current shaky relationship with digital products and news distribution and, in turn, with their monetization streams and readers journalists don’t have to sit back and watch this bot story unfold there are no definitive paradigms yet, so we can help write the book on creating the most engaging experiences

58% of millennials say they are more compelled by online advertising than television advertising, while 38% of parents make purchases online directly from their mobile device we’re not even into october yet, so there’s still plenty of time to start saving for your projected holiday expenses and the sooner you start, the more you’ll be able to budget little by little, instead of incurring one huge financial hit in december even if you’re opposed to buying in october, you can start by browsing for sales, checking when prices on different items might drop, comparing reviews to find the right gifts, and of course, putting away whatever you can spare so you have a healthy holiday shopping stash

Article - (ap) – the evacuation of civilians and opposition fighters from eastern aleppo have been suspended after rebels opened fire on a convoy at one of the crossing points of the rebel-held enclave, according to syrian state tv it was not immediately clear how long the suspension, which was announced within a couple of hours after the evacuations resumed on friday, would last ikhbariya tv also claimed that the rebels tried to take with them captives they had seized and were holding in the rebel enclave however, a military news service run by lebanon’s pro-damascus hizbullah group said the evacuation had been halted partly due to a failure to evacuate wounded people from two shia villages besieged by rebels in idlib it also cited previous reasons given for the suspension of the evacuation: that rebels had sought to take prisoners with them and had bombarded a road due to be used by the buses set to conduct the evacuation from the two villages, al-foua and kefraya hizbullah, an iran-backed lebanese shia group, is fighting on the side of president bashar al-assad in syria’s civil war lebanon-based al-mayadeen tv said buses which were parked at the ramouseh crossing point in southern aleppo had left the area after it was targeted by gunmen earlier, syrian state tv reported that four convoys of fighters and civilians had departed from the rebel enclave on friday in the central province of hama, buses and ambulances were waiting to evacuate thousands of people from two shia villages besieged by rebels, a last-minute condition which became part of the ceasefire deal for aleppo iran had demanded that the evacuations from foua and kefraya be tied in with the mass movement out of eastern aleppo meanwhile, russian president vladimir putin said he and his turkish counterpart are working to launch a new round of peace talks between the syrian government and the opposition — negotiations which would take place in kazakhstan’s capital, astana mr putin, speaking during on a visit to japan on friday, said ankara had helped to broker the rebel exit from aleppo that is currently under way he said he and turkish president recep tayyip erdogan are also working for an overall truce in syria the russian leader said that once the syrian army secures control of all of aleppo, civilians will be able to return to their homes it was not immediately clear if western-backed syrian opposition would accept such a location for peace talks with mr assad’s government a turkish official said his country’s aid organisations are helping syrians who have been evacuated from aleppo to a border area held by the opposition in syria’s idlib province deputy prime minister veysi kaynak said on friday that 20 buses from aleppo have reached the safe zone under control of the free syrian army in idlib he said 30-35 injured people were being treated at the sahra hospital just over the border mr kaynak said there had been a discussion with syrian opposition forces over the possibility of establishing a centre within a security zone in syria he told the private dogan news agency that idlib has no physical capacity to accommodate so many people he estimated there are 80,000 to 100,000 individuals who would like to leave aleppo under the ceasefire deal which turkey helped broker he added that turkey is willing to provide assistance to legitimate syrian opposition groups to help meet their needs the minister spoke after visiting the cilvegozu border crossing with syria in southern turkey

Article - scientists have formulated a mathematical equation to project the mammoth effect homo sapiens are having on the planet and causing irreversible damage to the environment we’re now living in the anthropocene era - where human activity is the primary driver of change to the environment the impact of capitalist and heavily industrialised societies is equivalent to how an asteroid would impact the planet an equation aids in creating a manifestation of the risks of climate change through large-scale and widespread alterations to the planet owen gaffney and will stephen of australian national university drew up the equation, which was published in the anthropocene review journal, by homing in on the rate of change of earth’s life support system including the atmosphere, oceans, forests, waterway, ice sheets and other diverse limbs of the planet owen gaffney wrote in the new scientist, for four billion years, the rate of change of the earth system (e) has been a complex function of astronomical (a) and geophysical (g) forces plus internal dynamics (i): earth’s orbit around the sun, gravitational interactions with other planets, the sun’s heat output, colliding continents, volcanoes and evolution, among others he added, in the equation, astronomical and geophysical forces tend to zero because of their slow nature or rarity, as do internal dynamics, for now all these forces still exert pressure, but currently on orders of magnitude less than human impact steffen says that these forces have changed our natural environment at a rate of 001 degrees celsius per century however, greenhouse gases as a result of human activity over the past 45 years have increased the rate of temperature rise to 17 degrees celsius per century, dwarfing the natural background rate according to the two authors, these figures represent a change that is 170 times faster than natural forces we are not saying the astronomical forces of our solar system or geological processes have disappeared, but in terms of their impact in such a short period of time they are now negligible compared with our own influence, steffen said crystallising this evidence in the form of a simple equation gives the current situation a clarity that the wealth of data often dilutes what we do is give a very specific number to show how humans are affecting the earth over a short timeframe it shows that while other forces operate over millions of years, we as humans are having an impact at the same strength as the many of these other forces, but in the timeframe of just a couple of centuries the human magnitude of climate change looks more like a meteorite strike than a gradual change planet earth, they wrote, has proved its resilience beyond doubt as it has for millions of years withstood human meddling with the environment’s most natural state of flux having said that, homo sapiens have now reached an era where if we fail to reduce the impact of our activities, then climate change could trigger societal collapse, their research concluded just in

Article - virtually every film in modern memory ends with some variation of the same disclaimer: this is a work of fiction any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events, is purely coincidental the cut-and-paste legal rider must be the most boring thing in every movie that features it who knew its origins were so lurid? for that bit of boilerplate, we can indirectly thank none other than grigori rasputin, the famously hard-to-assassinate russian mystic and intimate of the last, doomed romanovs it all started when an exiled russian prince sued mgm in 1933 over the studio’s rasputin biopic, claiming that the american production did not accurately depict rasputin’s murder and the prince ought to have known, having murdered him here’s the story in 1916, the fabulously wealthy, oxford-educated prince felix yusupov was one of several russian aristocrats agonizing over the unseemly influence that rasputin—the magical healer, charismatic lech, and peasant—had over the czar and, particularly, the czarina in december, yusupov invited rasputin to his palace, where he offered him cyanide-laced cakes and then shot him although the czarina was distraught, the czar let yusupov off lightly, exiling the prince and his wife irina (in doing so, he inadvertently spared them from the impending slaughter of the revolution) a slate plus special feature: radio drama has returned to the spotlight—now what? the culture gabfest’s producer explains why radio drama isn’t dead listen to this special slate plus bonus segment by joining – your first two weeks are free sixteen years later, mgm produced rasputin and the empress, based on those events its big coup was casting the three barrymore siblings—stars of stage and silent film—in the lead roles lionel played rasputin, ethel the czarina, and john (grandfather of drew) was prince paul chegodieff, a composite, who murders rasputin yusupov, now penniless in paris, heard about the film and thought it defamatory he argued audiences would recognize him in the fictional assassin—in part because he’d publicly cashed in on his infamy, penning a braggy memoir about killing rasputin he wasn’t wrong: the new york times, in its review, noted that chegodieff was really intended to represent [yusupov] but having copped to being a murderer, yusupov couldn’t build much of a libel case instead, he alleged that rasputin and the empress in fact defamed his wife in the film, chegodieff’s wife is princess natasha, a supporter of rasputin but the mystic, wary of her husband, hypnotizes and rapes her, rendering natasha—by his logic, with which she agrees—unfit to be a wife yusupov contended that as viewers would equate chegodieff with yusupov, so would they link natasha with irina but while yusupov was portrayed more or less accurately, irina and rasputin had never met (the scene also libeled rasputin, but him being dead, you could say anything, then as now: rasputin sucks, rasputin liked to caress his big beard and give it little kisses, etc) an mgm researcher had pointed out this factual discrepancy to the studio during production and warned that the yusupovs could sue; the studio fired her mgm was satisfied, dramatically, with the rape scene, despite there being no basis for it in real life if it was shock they were interested in, one could imagine them constructing a similar scene around rasputin and the czarina—about whom there were prurient rumors, which rasputin himself encouraged by whipping his dick out in a restaurant and boasting of giving it to the old girl—but mgm couldn’t do that after casting a real-life brother and sister in those roles poster via wikimedia commons irina yusupov sued the studio, and the jury found in her favor, awarding her £25,000, or about $125,000 mgm had to take the film out of circulation for decades and purge the offending scene for all time what proved to be mgm’s undoing was its lack of deniability unwisely, they’d prefaced the film with this: this concerns the destruction of an empire  a few of the characters are still alive—the rest met death by violence from that, audiences could logically infer that the yusupovs, being the only relevant characters still alive, were represented as the chegodieffs a justice in the case told mgm that the studio might have stood a better chance had they incorporated a disclaimer stating the exact opposite: that the film was not intended as an accurate portrayal of real people or events apparently overcautious in the wake of the landmark lawsuit, the film industry slapped that wording on everything for decades, films disclaimed absolutely any relationship to reality—even when it was patently untrue the jake lamotta biopic raging bull credits lamotta as a consultant and cites his memoir as a source text just minutes before asserting that he is the film’s entirely fictional invention comedy central

Article - cats are deeply curious creatures recent evidence suggests that these tiny lions see us as inessential landlords, or rubbish, fur-lacking kittens a new internet craze involving our feline companions has unveiled another piece of strange information: for some utterly bizarre reason, they appear to be terrified – utterly terrified – of cucumbers in the vast majority of the videos, cat owners are seen sneaking up behind their pets as they’re facing the other way – mostly eating – and placing the green, elongated vegetable behind them as the cat turns around and spots the unexpected item, it loses its mind, leaps into the air, and gets away from it as fast as it can in some videos, the cats then engage in a stare down with the cucumber, waiting in vain for it to make its first move but the question remains: why on earth are cats frightened by these innocuous vegetables? to be fair, there aren’t any videos of cats seeing a cucumber from a distance and then walking up to interrogate it, so perhaps it’s the unexpected sight of a cucumber behind them that’s frightening, not the cucumber itself: an unexpected pineapple would likely be just as jarring as it turns out, dr roger mugford, a specialist in animal behavior, told the telegraph: i think that the reaction is due to the novelty and unexpectedness of finding an unusual object secretly placed whilst their heads were down in the food bowl cats are shown to be suspicious of anything that moves rapidly, makes a lot of noise, or lights up erratically: essentially, anything that they don’t fully understand, which isn’t really that different from most animals, including humans it’s also worth noting that cats are mostly solitary animals, and humans are as sociable as animals can be – so they’re baffled enough by us as it is freaking them out with unexpected cucumbers probably isn’t helping cats have to be suspicious of the unknown: it could represent the danger of a snake or another predator, mugford continued i suspect that there would be the same reaction to a model spider, a plastic fish or a human face mask well, there’s only one way to find out this is, after all, for science get your model spiders at the ready

Article_Title - want to lose more weight? simply replace your diet soda with this after meals
Article - last year, some surprising news came from a study that suggested diet beverages were more effective in promoting weight loss than water was of course, the surprise was lessened by the news that the study was funded in totality by the american beverage association, the membership of which includes many soft drink companies due to the recency of those findings (they circulated in june 2014), the results haven’t been totally disproven however, a study conducted at the university of nottingham published earlier this month in the american journal of clinical nutrition offers some contradiction these results won’t be surprising to much of the population, especially as the positive effects of diet beverages is called more and more frequently into question against full-sugar drinks, never mind sugar- and calorie-free water however, there is a set of the population (one that the american beverage association is trying to no doubt grow) that believes diet sodas are at least as effective, if not more so, than water in losing weight a sample of 89 women who usually drank diet beverages, with bmis of 27-40 (slightly to moderately overweight), were parsed into two groups: those who would continue to drink diet beverages after eating their lunch and those who would replace their diet drinks with water they did so five times per week for 24 weeks the group drinking the water after their meals had a larger average weight loss than those who stuck with the diet beverages, and also improved the water group’s insulin resistance, the benefit of which could be leveraged in various medical treatments this is among the first studies to offer a rebuttal to the aba-funded study, and it suggests, as many would believe, diet beverages do not beat water when it comes to losing weight

Article - tom hanks has the scene in captain phillips, a moment that will play during the academy awards when jennifer lawrence announces hanks as a best actor nominee on march 2, 2014 that hanks, a two-time best actor winner and five-time nominee, is at his very best before the key sequence in paul greengrass new film should provide oscar prognosticators with all they need to know about the 57-year-old actors awards chances captain phillips is set to open the 2013 new york film festival, but sony and producer scott rudin set up screenings this week for critics and journalists to see the film while all eyes are fixed on toronto thus far, the move paid off: reviews have been solid, with some (in contention editor kris tapley, huffpost entertainments own mike ryan) more infatuated with the film than others (variety critic scott foundas, the wrap critic alonso duralde) heed the words from the former camp: captain phillips stands at the very top of the recent spate of thinking-persons action films from the last few years, on par with kathryn bigelows zero dark thirty and well ahead of ben afflecks best picture-winning argo the reason is hanks, who gives the type of performance everyone has wanted to see from tom hanks since the early 2000s his richard phillips is not the most emotional of men: an opening scene with his wife (played very briefly but beautifully by catherine keener) establishes him as the kind of thoughtful, quiet type who one can assume watches the history channel and likes tommy lee jones movies yet as greengrass keeps turning the screws on phillips and his situation, that cool demeanor begins to crack, shatter and, later, turn to dust hanks is put through the ringer -- greengrass closed-quarters camera work keeps in him the action even as things get impossibly physical -- and the results are breathtaking like the best acting, hanks performance actually feels real by the end of the film, its hard to tell where hanks ends and phillips begins this is the time of year when a new oscar front-runner debuts almost every day (gravity and 12 years a slave reached the top of the line after raves last week) yet captain phillips belongs in those whispered early awards musings, not just for hanks and greengrass (a previous nominee for united 93, a film that bears similarities to captain phillips in structure and form), but for best editing (christopher rouse), best cinematography (barry ackroyd), best adapted screenplay (billy ray) and, if a wave of support carries the film to multiple nominations, perhaps best supporting actor for barkhad abdi the newcomer plays muse, the lead somali pirate in the film, a relatively decent man turned to evil behavior by his standing in life abdi (and barkhad addirahman, faysal ahmed, mahat m ali as the other pirates) helps keep the film from ever truly demonizing phillips kidnappers, an easy pitfall that greengrass deftly avoids the problem is that abdi doesnt have an easy road to supporting actor: the category is as loaded as usual, with actors like daniel bruhl (for rush), michael fassbender (for 12 years a slave), josh brolin (for labor day), steve coogan (for philomena), bradley cooper (for american hustle) and even hanks (for saving mr banks) potentially standing in his way that, however, is back-room chatter for another day for now, just know that captain phillips is one of those truly terrific movies that everyone hopes to see in the fall its riveting filmmaking captain phillips opens on oct 11

Article - juan a lozano, associated press houston (ap) — evidence from more than 6,600 rape kits that went untested for years in houston have turned up 850 hits in the fbis nationwide database of dna profiles, marking a major step in the citys $6 million effort to address the backlog, officials announced monday charges have been filed against 29 people, six of whom have been convicted, since the city launched an effort in 2013 to test 6,663 rape kits — some of which dated back nearly three decades testing was completed in the fall, and the results have now been uploaded to a database used by investigators nationwide to compare dna profiles of possible suspects, mayor annise parker said this milestone is of special importance to rape survivors and their families and friends because it means their cases are receiving the attention they should have years ago, parker said at a news conference, where she joined local law enforcement officials to announce the results police are continuing to review the matches to see if charges can be filed in other cases in the cases where prosecutors have won convictions, defendants have received sentences ranging from 2 to 45 years in prison one case was dismissed after the victim decided not to pursue the case rape kits include biological samples and physical evidence gathered from sexual assault victims that are later processed to see if they match a suspects dna testing results are uploaded to the fbis combined dna index system, or codis harris county district attorney devon anderson said there were some cases where suspects committed other crimes while rape kits that could have identified them sat untested now that the testing of these kits is complete, we know that its up to us to finish the job and to seek justice for these victims the ball is in our court and we will do our best to put the people who are responsible for these heinous crimes behind bars for as long as possible, she said experts say houstons backlog — and similar backlogs in other us cities — are due in part to the high cost of testing which can run from $500 to $1,000 per kit, though advocates argue that the lack of testing signals that sex crimes havent always been law enforcement priorities more than 12,000 kits went untested for years in memphis, tennessee, which is facing a lawsuit from rape victims as it tries to test the kits in detroit, prosecutors discovered more than 11,000 rape kits in an abandoned police warehouse in 2009, and cleveland prosecutors have sent their entire 4,700-kit backlog for testing this is not a houston problem its not a texas problem its a nationwide issue that built up over years and years, parker said ___

what if this isn’t our worst fight? what if there’s a worse one ahead of us and we don’t have our box?!? as my great uncle bill would say, nothing is ever so bad that it couldn’t get worse all along, we assumed that the contents of that box held the key to saving a marriage – an age old trick – unbeknownst to us rookies after all, my great aunt and uncle had been married for nearly half a century so, we thought the box would save us – and in a way it did that box went beyond what i believe my great aunt had intended it was by far the greatest wedding gift of all for 9 years (and three moves) that box sat high on a shelf in various closets gathering dust, yet it somehow taught us about tolerance, understanding, compromise and patience our marriage strengthened as we became best friends, partners, and teammates today, we decided to open that box, because i finally had a realization i realized that the tools for creating and maintaining a strong, healthy marriage were never within that box – they were within us # lovewhatmatters love what matters original story submitted by kathy gunn see more 14k 680 31k brandon and kathy gunn kathy gunn kathy gunn brandon and kathy gunn kathy gunn no offense to your vitamix, but its safe to say that this is the greatest wedding gift of all timealthough kathy and brandon gunn have been married since sept 1, 2007, they still had one wedding that they hadnt opened – until this may kathy wrote a post explaining why theyd waited to open the gift, which was from her great aunt alison and was attached to a note that read, do not open until your first disagreementnow, there had obviously been plenty of disagreements, arguments and slammed doors throughout our 9 years, she wrote in the post , which was shared by the page love what matters on august 29 there were even a couple of instances where we both considered giving up  but we never opened the boxkathy admits that theyd avoided opening the box after all these years because they thought it would have symbolized a failure to us, it would have meant that we didnt have what it takes to make our marriage work – and were both to stubborn and determined for that, she wrote so it forced us to reassess situations was it really time to open the box?

Article - men are more likely to have a heart attack after a snowfall, and its probably from the exertion of shoveling snow, canadian researchers reported monday they found a slight increase in both heart attacks and deaths from heart attack in quebec after a storm the likelihood went up with each extra day of snow, they reported in the canadian medical association journal we suspect that shoveling was the main mechanism linking snowfall with myocardial infarction (heart attack), dr nathalie auger of the university of montreal hospital research center and colleagues wrote men are potentially more likely than women to shovel, particularly after heavy snowfalls snow shoveling is a demanding cardiovascular exercise requiring more than 75 percent of the maximum heart rate, particularly with heavy loads, they added the team studied 128,000 heart attack cases between 1981 and 2014, and more than 68,000 people who died a single day of snowfall raised a mans risk of heart attack by just less than 1 percent, they wrote, and it raised his risk of dying from a heart attack by 12 percent eight inches of snowfall raised the risk 16 percent compared to a day in the same month that did not have snow, they reported, and men were one-third more likely to die of a heart attack the day after an eight-inch snowfall, compared to a dry day women were not more likely to either have heart attacks or to die of them after snow, the team found snow shoveling is hard its not a daily activity, and it strains the heart, augers team said people often exhale hard with their mouths closed while lifting a heavy shovel full of snow, a dangerous habit called the valsalva maneuver, they noted using the arms intensively and repetitively, especially while standing upright, can also raise the risk that a piece will break off from a clogged artery, the researchers noted cold temperatures make blood vessels constrict, which adds to the danger it might not only be shoveling that does it people using snow blowers have also been reported to have higher rates of heart attack, the canadian team noted the national safety council has some advice for how to safely shovel snow: do not shovel after eating or while smoking take it slow and stretch out before you begin push the snow rather than lifting it if you do lift it, use a small shovel or only partially fill the shovel lift with your legs, not your back do not work to the point of exhaustion talk to a doctor before shoveling if you have a history of heart disease stop immediately if you feel dizzy or tightness in the chest

Article - minnesota will consider passing legislation to legalize the medical use of marijuana, but police agencies are standing in the way a bill in the state house of representatives would legalize the possession and use of up to 25 ounces of marijuana for people suffering from a range of medical conditions including cancer, tourettes syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder or any other medical condition approved by the state commissioner of health patients would first need to obtain an id card by getting written certification from a doctor, says measure hf 1818, which was introduced by rep carly melin (d-hibbing) last spring theres evidence that state politicians are open to passing such a bill a similar effort was approved by the minnesota house and senate in 2009 before being vetoed by then-governor tim pawlenty (r) this time around, governor mark dayton (d) says hed sign the bill -- but not without the support of minnesota law enforcement agencies so far, not a single agency has lent its support to the bill their opposition, according to a report in local paper st cloud times, is based on fears that marijuanas medical benefits are still unproven, that any legalization effort will increase the drugs availability to kids and that the bill is too broad in listing qualifying conditions the head of one police agency put it another way: he openly admitted that he was worried legalizing weed for medical purposes might make it harder for police to get federal drug war dollars minnesota receives millions in anti-drug money from the white house every year, and asset seizures from drug raids have become an integral part of state police budgets, politics in minnesota reported earlier this month as a result, melin has said she may draft a compromise bill to legalize marijuana extracts in pill or liquid form while such a law would be much more restrictive in terms of which patients could receive cannabis for treatment, some law enforcement agencies have said they might be open to such a measure obviously any compromise  [is] disheartening for patients, melin told the la crosse tribune but we’re facing reality around here, which is if we can get anything done there’s going to have to be compromise minnesota voters, on the other hand, have shown they overwhelmingly support legalizing medical marijuana in all its forms a st cloud state university poll from last year found 76 percent support for the issue hf 1818 has been referred to the health and human services policy committee and is scheduled to have a hearing wednesday evening melin said her compromise bill could be ready as soon as next week

Article - washington -- arizona lawmakers are pushing to provide elected officials with more privacy as they draft legislation because they say the states requirements for open meetings make it too difficult for them to do their jobs the plan, proposed by state sen sylvia allen (r), would allow lawmakers to meet privately to negotiate and draft measures and would require them to have public debate only once a body takes an action, such as a vote arizonas current laws require that officials hold a public meeting any time a quorum discusses matters that could result in legal action state sen carlyle begay (d), one of the bills co-sponsors, told the huffington post that the states requirements on open meetings make it extremely difficult for lawmakers who represent rural areas, where officials have to travel hours to be in the same room, to accomplish anything that can make it hard for officials to deal with matters that need urgent and swift attention, begay said its a way to update how our elected officials are able to converse to associate with elected officials they sit on boards with in a way that allows them to do their business, to advocate and represent the best interests of their communities a lot easier, begay said right now its a hardship for these officials because they have to post open meeting laws and post notice for simple discussions if they need to get together to address issues begay said the bill isnt intended to give lawmakers an opportunity to discuss unethical or immoral criminal issues behind closed doors were all held to a certain standard and i think thats the expectation that were not trying to decrease transparency and openness but were leaving that discretion to the elected officials themselves to ensure that when public input and public comment is needed that they do that, he said in fact, allen told the arizona daily sun that the states open meetings laws produce an undemocratic law-making process because officials arent allowed to meet privately to discuss legislation, officials must send staffers to serve as a go-between among colleagues to reach a consensus that process, allen told the arizona daily sun, is undemocratic because it allows unelected staff members to play a central role in drafting laws staff wasnt elected, staff isnt accountable, allen told the daily sun dan barr, a first amendment lawyer with the firm perkins coie, said the time when a policy is deliberated before a measure is introduced is a critical point for public input it allows you to see how your various public officials are approaching their jobs, how they view certain issues, what their thought process is, what their reasoning process is, barr told the huffington post it allows people then to participate in that barr added that open meetings laws shouldnt be weakened just because they make the lives of elected officials more difficult efficiency in government is not the primary goal of a democracy, barr told the huffington post our whole theory of government is that the people are the governors and that they give limited power to the government, and for the public to adequately assess what its government is doing, it needs as much transparency as possible

Article - [warning: adult language] friday on cnn tonight, network host fareed zakaria said president donald trump has succeeded by bullshitting zakaria said, i think the president is somewhat indifferent to things that are true or false he has spent his whole life bullshitting he has succeeded by bullshitting he has gotten the presidency by bullshitting it’s very hard to tell somebody at that point that bullshit doesn’t work because look at results right?  but that’s what he does he sees something he doesn’t particularly care if it’s true or not just puts it out there and then he puts something else out notice again at the press conference, when pushed on it, does take responsibility ‘i wasn’t saying that just quoting somebody else’ when you have the white house press secretary quote somebody to prove a point, you’re endorsing that view

Article_Title - how long does sex normally last?
Article - if you’re a non-scientist, you might have once asked yourself, propped against the bedhead after disappointingly quick intercourse, how long does sex normally last? a scientist, though, would phrase the same question in an almost comically obscure way: what is the mean intravaginal ejaculation latency time? i know there’s a lot more to sex than putting the penis into the vagina and ejaculating, but the rest is not always easy to define (kissing? rubbing? grinding?) to keep things simple and specific, we’ll just focus on the time to ejaculation measuring an average time to ejaculation is not a straightforward matter what about just asking people how long they take, you say? well, there are two main problems with this one is that people are likely to be biased upwards in their time estimates, because it’s socially desirable to say you go long into the night the other problem is that people don’t necessarily know how long they go for sex isn’t something people normally do while monitoring the bedside clock, and unassisted time estimation may be difficult during a transportative session of love-making what does the research say? the best study we have estimating the average time to ejaculation in the general population involved 500 couples from around the world timing themselves having sex over a four-week period – using a stopwatch that is as practically awkward as it sounds: participants pressed start at penile penetration and stop at ejaculation you may note this could affect the mood somewhat, and might perhaps not exactly reflect the natural flow of things but – science is rarely perfect, and this is the best we’ve got so what did the researchers find? the most striking result is that there was a huge amount of variation the average time for each couple (that is, averaged across all the times they had sex) ranged from 33 seconds to 44 minutes that’s an 80-fold difference  where tech meets sex    6 show all   where tech meets sex   1/6 lovely - the smart sex toy that has been dubbed the fitbit for your penis tired of not being able to track the average speed of your thrusts during sex?

as an evolutionary researcher, all this talk of how long sex lasts make me wonder: why does it last any time at all? all sex really needs to achieve, it seems, is to put sperm into the vagina why all the thrusting and bumping? instead of sliding the penis in and out many hundreds of times per sexual session, why not just put it in once, ejaculate, and then go have a lemonade and get on with the rest of the day? before you say, because it’s fun to go in and out!, remember evolution doesn’t care about fun per se – it generally only designs things to be enjoyable if they helped our ancestors pass on their genes to future generations for example, even though we like eating food, we don’t chew each mouthful of it for five minutes just to make the enjoyment last longer that would be inefficient, and so we’ve evolved to find it gross   play current time 0:00 / duration time 0:00 remaining time -0:00 stream type live loaded : 0% progress : 0% 00:00  fullscreen playback rate 1  subtitles subtitles off  captions captions settings captions settings captions off  chapters chapters  mute 00:00  share foreground --- white black red green blue yellow magenta cyan --- opaque semi-opaque background --- white black red green blue yellow magenta cyan --- opaque semi-transparent transparent window --- white black red green blue yellow magenta cyan --- opaque semi-transparent transparent font size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400% text edge style none raised depressed uniform dropshadow font family default monospace serif proportional serif monospace sans-serif proportional sans-serif casual script small caps defaults done  close share video: share via:  facebook  google+  twitter  tumblr  pinterest  linkedin start from: direct link: embed code:  restart the uks favourite sex positions why we last so long is a pretty complicated question with no clear answer, but a clue may be in the way the penis is shaped in 2003, researchers showed – using artificial vaginas, artificial penises, and artificial sperm (corn syrup) – that the ridge around the head of the penis actually scoops out pre-existing syrup from the vagina what this suggests is that men’s repeated thrusting might function to displace other men’s semen before ejaculating, ensuring their own swimmers have a better chance of reaching the egg first incidentally, this could explain why it becomes painful for a man to continue thrusting after ejaculating, since that would risk scooping out his own semen as well so what to do with this information?

Article_Title - the antibodies that were invented to help immunologists find god
Article - in the classic 1966 science fiction film, fantastic voyage , a submarine is shrunk to microscopic size and injected into the blood stream of a scientist to remove a blood clot in his brain the film illustrates many aspects of biology, perhaps most memorably when raquel welch ventures out of the submarine and is attacked by antibody molecules, which recognise her as a foreign invader and try to destroy her the antibodies of the film look like wriggly bits of string that rush at her and then adapt themselves to the shape of her body for an immunologist fantastic voyage is interesting as it was made when there were competing theories of how antibodies worked one, the instructional theory, suggested that all antibody molecules were the same, but they folded themselves around their target and learned its shape – to forestall future invasions – before destroying it the alternative – clonal selection theory – says that there were billions of different antibodies, each with a different shape each b cell (a type of immune cell) specialises in making just one type of antibody when a foreign invader, such as bacteria, enters the body, only one b cell will recognise it that b cell would begin to rapidly divide, making large numbers of clones these newly cloned b cells secrete large amounts of antibody which stick to the invader and mark it for destruction the instructional theory was championed by no less a person than two-time nobel prize winner linus pauling , while macfarlane burnet (also a nobel prize winner) was the key proponent of clonal selection  the makers of the film followed pauling, though, whether this was for scientific reasons or because the interaction between stringy antibodies and welch made for better cinema isn’t clear however, they were wrong, clonal selection theory won the argument nowadays clonal selection seems so obviously right that it is difficult to remember that it initially appeared to have a fatal flaw scientists knew that the immune system of an animal could make antibodies to any foreign antigen in the 1930s karl landsteiner showed that antibodies could be made to chemicals that never even existed naturally this led to a problem: for the clonal theory to be correct, there had to be pre-existing antibodies in animals or humans capable of recognising any antigen that might ever exist this would require billions of different antibodies and as every antibody is encoded by a separate gene, for there to be billions of antibody molecules there would also have to be billions of different genes but there are no more than 25,000 genes to encode for everything in the human body, considerably fewer than needed to make the clonal selection theory possible the god problem in several in the 1960s and 70s immunologists were increasingly convinced by the clonal selection theory this led to a race to discover the solution to the problem of how so many different antibodies could be encoded it was termed the generation of diversity, or god problem the god problem was such an important and intriguing question that it attracted many of the best scientists of the decade, and resulted nobel prizes  scientists showed that god was due to several biological mechanisms that people had not realised could happen, including rearrangement of chunks of dna in chromosomes, and deliberate mutation of dna sequences the difficulty and novelty of the science meant that immunologists had to develop new technologies and some of these techniques, which were used to answer fundamental questions, ended up having practical applications perhaps most notably césar milstein was interested in understanding how, during an immune response, antibodies improve and become better at binding to their antigens he wanted to immunise an animal and then, at various times, isolate b cells to make antibodies he could then use these to study how well they bound to their antigen, and also sequence the gene encoding the antibody to see how it changed over time in doing so he developed, together with georges köhler in 1975, a method that made b cells live forever, making limitless amounts of what they called a monoclonal antibody milstein realised that their technique, called hybridoma technology, had much wider applications in science and medicine the impact of monoclonal antibodies as scientific tools and for the treatment of diseases has been immense because they can be made in large amounts, and are specific, they are used in many experiments and clinical tests they have now also become an important type of drug , having an important role to play in treating many cancers as well as other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis  in economic terms, monoclonal antibody therapies are estimated to have had sales of us$75 billion in 2013 in an age that demands that science is useful and should be applied, it is perhaps worth remembering that one of the most important technologies in medicine and biology was developed to answer a very basic scientific question scientists are motivated to develop new techniques to answer important questions they often later find that these techniques have important practical applications beyond their original purpose applications that could save millions of lives

Article - have you ever come across an abandoned building and just get the feeling that something amazing could be inside? i do all the time taking risks and going places you aren’t supposed to is a great adrenaline rush now, i’m not trying to promote trespassing of any kind i’m a responsible adultsometimes the excitement of the unknown is what drives many people’s curiosity when they decide to finally give urban exploring a try maybe you’ll see a ghost, or find an abandoned safe it’s never the same thing twice though you really don’t have any idea what you’re going to find or discover well that was the driving force behind a man named dan bell and his recent decision to explore an abandoned apartment complex it started out as a simple urban exploration video, but turned into something much more life-threatening in mere moments check out the pictures and video he captured, and how this attempt at urban exploration was almost his last he starts out his journey in a small alleyway formed by the abandoned building this place looks like something out of a horror movie dan had passed by this scary abandoned apartment for a few weeks, and just couldn’t seem to get it off his mind dan had found blood and animals parts around different part of the property in a previous shorter visit he had also found summoning markings around certain parts of the property as with all great urban explorers however, this only made his curiosity grow with every step he climbed a ladder to reach an upper level of the apartment complex inside he found what you would expect to find in an old abandoned building trash was littered through the maze of rooms and hallways the paint was peeling off of every single wall, while some walls weren’t even standing anymore every step he took was a gamble that the floor would support his weight the remnant of what used to be tenants mail boxes for their apartments this place definitely fell into serious decay after it was not longer being used falling debris was a definite worry while walking through this place it’s so old the wood is rotting and won’t support the weight it used too it became clearer and clearer that people had been in here after the place was abandoned apparently tony wanted everyone to know he was there at one point finding a spot to step onto without the threat of a nail in your foot was quite the exercise a tense moment came when dan took a step, and the ground beneath him literally started to crumble and disintegrate it’s a tense moment in an already tense video he was extremely lucky that the floor never caved in on him during his visit after walking through the upper levels for a bit, dan decides to climb back down the ladder and tackle the ground level floors this would be a turning point in the video what happens next is something that i would never want to experience dan decided to check out an area up a flight of stairs when he reached the top, he caught sight of something that just didn’t seem to fit with the rest of his surroundings just an ordinary reusable grocery bag right the snapple sticking out of the bag makes it seem like it was definitely put here recently of course, someone who has already come this far is going to investigate even further! well damn! that’s a bunch of crack cocain ready to be sold! as soon as i saw this, my mood about this situation would have changed this isn’t just a poke around an abandoned building anymore after examining the contents of the container, dan understandably got seriously freaked out this was clearly a crack house, and he was standing there with a dealers stash people have gotten killed for less well guess what? the dealer comes back! pretty damn intense right?! this guy is seriously super lucky i don’t have a doubt in my mind if these guys would have found him he would be dead this building is definitely in the slums if you watch the whole video, at around the 5:07 mark, you can clearly hear multiple gun shots ringing through the air in the general area that right there would have probably be enough for me to say it’s time to go luckily dan was able to wait out the crack dealer and his client and make a hasty getaway you can clearly tell he is shaken up by the experience though as he is almost crying by the time he gets outside he really was lucky to escape with his life

Article_Title - china is too quick to rebalance its services sector
Article - reuters for years, economists have been saying that china needs to rebalance its economy, and the government is on board with this daunting project that means the country is attempting to move from an economy based on investment in industrial manufacturing to one based on domestic consumption driven by regular chinese people working in the services sector that is, china has been moving toward fewer coal miners and construction workers in favor of more bankers and shopkeepers but what if weve got this all wrong? what if china is transitioning too early? thats what hsbc economists qu hongbin and jing li have posited in a recent note, chinas new challenge: faster services expansion, slower productivity growth from the note (emphasis added): both economic theory and empirical evidence suggest that premature deindustrialisation in developing countries can be damaging it blocks the main channel of productivity growth, and therefore reduces the economys potential growth rate and its prospects of catching up with more advanced economies based on the experience of some latin american countries, a lack of adequate investment and a tendency of specialising according to short-term, rather than long-term, comparative advantage are common mistakes made by developing countries this kind of development strategy can result in an underdeveloped industrial sector and slow productivity growth given that chinas gdp per capita is only 14% that of the us, we believe it is way too early to shift towards services-led growth work, work, work, work, work what really worries hsbc is that the service sectors jobs, while in general more labor intensive, are less productive for the economy than jobs in the industrial and manufacturing sectors the banks analysts point out that workers in the former are just 80% as productive as those in the latter hsbc arguing against a shift to service-led growth is a super controversial thing because the chinese government has already made rebalancing a top project — if not in deed, then certainly in word the reason for that is simple: debt china has a debt-to-gdp ratio of over 280% most of that is concentrated in the industrial and manufacturing sectors in 2009, when the world was falling apart, the chinese government decided to just open the money spigots to keep its economy running at full steam that, coupled with a general lack of global demand for materials like steel and coal produced in chinese factories, has led to overcapacity in those sectors so, to combat that overcapacity, china would like to have fewer people working the jobs where theyre making the things that it seems the world has entirely too much of the rest of the world would love that, too last week, the us house of representatives held a hearing on the chinese economy , evaluating the financial risks of china, and much of it focused on what that countrys economic slowdown has done to the american steel industry during the hearing, thomas gibson, president of the american iron and steel institute, pointed out that 33 steel manufacturers have gone bankrupt since the 1990s he also said that, between 2011 and 2015, the chinese government claimed that 90 million tons of overcapacity in its steel market had been taken care of in reality, 300 million tons had been added to chinas steel output so what gibson would like is for china to slow its production and wind the steel industry down the problem with this solution, says hsbc, is that moving away from industry and manufacturing means that china wont grow as fast — not just in the short term, but also in the long term from the note (emphasis added): the efficiency loss during such a rebalancing can be huge between 2012 and 2015, the total number of migrant workers in the manufacturing sector declined by nearly 7m, compared with an increase of 5m in the three biggest services sectors (ie wholesale and retail, residential services, transportation and logistics) based on 2015 statistics, each worker in the manufacturing sector generated rmb45,000 more output than their counterpart in the three biggest services sectors therefore, if all 5m workers had been employed in the manufacturing sector rather than services, chinas total output in 2015 could have been rmb225bn higher, which is around 03% of annual gdp hsbc suggests that the country makes more targeted and productive investments in the manufacturing and industrial sectors but, to be honest, the chinese government hasnt shown that kind of subtlety even now, banks continue to lend to unproductive corporations in order to keep workers employed and avoid a hard landing in the short term meanwhile, the transition to the service sector continues pretty controversial ideas, no?
