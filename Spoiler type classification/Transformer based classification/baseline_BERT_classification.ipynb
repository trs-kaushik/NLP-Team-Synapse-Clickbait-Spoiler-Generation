But what was in the insecticide, and how does it work? The main ingredient of the insecticide, Dibrom, is the chemical naled. It works by killing mosquitoes on contact. Sprayers produce very fine droplets that are small enough to stay airborne and intercept mosquitoes in flight. Naled does not pose a health risk to either people or pets when sprayed in low concentrations, according to both the Environmental Protection Agency (PDF) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, in its own review of naled, the European Union came to a different conclusion. Naled degrades to dichlorvos , a toxic chemical, in the presence of sunlight, and according to the EU scientific commission , this can cause genetic mutations. As a result, the EU has banned agricultural use of products containing naled. In Puerto Rico, where a public health emergency has been declared due to the sheer number of cases of Zika, recommendations from the CDC and the EPA to use aerial spraying to control the mosquito population there have been stymied by protests. Activists organized a June 28 demonstration outside the San Juan CDC and raised concerns about the consequences for human health and their environment. By contrast, in Miami-Dade County, the Department of Solid Waste Management\\'s Mosquito Control Section commonly sprays in response to state Department of Health investigations -- and when residents request the use of insecticide. The Mosquito Control Section has applied naled via an ultra-low-volume spray for many years, officials said in a news release. In fact, Dibrom has been used in the United States over the past 50 years, said Timothy J. Donnelly, vice president, chief administrative officer and general counsel of AMVAC Chemical Corp ., which makes the insecticide. \"It is regularly sprayed in 12 states on over 15 million acres each year,\" Donnelly said. Since the variety of mosquito that carries Zika is most active predawn and at sunset, all spraying must take place at those times. Special precautions are not necessary, Miami-Dade County officials advised, though people with allergies may want to remain indoors. During any insecticide operation, it is recommended that beekeepers cover their bees. Aerial spraying, which lasts about an hour, was recommended by the CDC and Florida\\'s Department of Health to reduce the population of adult mosquitoes, some of which may be capable of spreading viruses, including Zika. Originally scheduled for Wednesday, the aerial spraying operation was delayed because of poor weather conditions. \"When Naled gets sprayed, it knocks out the mosquitoes, but if sprayed over water, it breaks down quickly,\" said Bryn Phillips, a specialist in the University of California, Davis environmental toxicology department. His research indicates that the insecticide breaks down into different chemical versions of Naled. One of these versions, dichlorvos, is quite toxic to aquatic species at the \"low end of the food chain,\" like aquatic insects and frog larvae -- \"basically fish food,\" Phillips said. If the chemicals are rotated and managed properly, an environmental area can recover, Phillips noted. Naled spray droplets stay airborne for an extended period, and the chemical begins to break down once exposed to sunlight or water. Very little of the low-concentration spray settles on the ground. Those who worry that they may have come into contact with the chemicals should wash, county officials advised; any food that may have been exposed should be rinsed before eating. Since concentrations are far below what is harmful to humans, symptoms, such as skin irritation or headache, are unlikely. Miami-Dade County\\'s aerial spraying alternates between naled and an insecticide called BTI (bacillus thuringiensis israelensis, a naturally occurring bacterium), which targets mosquito larvae instead of adult mosquitoes. BTI has been registered with the EPA since 1961 as a pesticide. Zika was discovered in 1947 in Uganda. An outbreak that began in Brazil in 2015 has spread throughout the Americas. Florida reported the nation\\'s first local transmission of Zika from an infected mosquito in late July. Zika has been shown to be responsible for an alarming increase in microcephaly, in which babies are born with small brains and heads, as well as other hearing, vision and developmental disorders. Although spraying insecticides raises concerns about toxicity to aquatic life, policy-makers must weigh the potential costs to human health by not spraying and costs to environmental health by spraying, Phillips said.

              "  {'guid': 11, 'text_a': 'Do birds fart? - Do birds fart?Have you ever wondered, \"Do birds fart?\" No? Well maybe now we’ve sparked your curiosity. They don’t fart—detectably. There’s no reason to believe that birds are somehow exempt from passing gas, but it doesn’t seem like anyone has ever truly observed—or more importantly, measured—a bird fart. But between ornithologists, veterinarians, and amateur bird watchers, how is it possible no one has ever seen the feathered creatures flatulate? As Monterey Bay Aquarium veterinarian Mike Murray said in a 2009 article for Popular Science, birds are capable of passing gas, but they don’t because they lack the same combination of diet and gas-forming bacteria in their gut that gives mammals their odorous gas. Murray added that if he spotted gas in an x-ray of a bird’s gastrointestinal tract, he’d be concerned something was wrong with the bird. But Laura Eriksen, a birder, educator, and blogger at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, has a different theory. In a blog post on her website, she posits that birds have much shorter digestive tracts than mammals, so there’s less time for gas to build up, allowing farts to slip by undetected. In another blog post, she describes the only written account she’s aware of describing a possible bird fart. It comes from former Cornell student Alan Richard Weisbrod, in his 1965 master’s thesis on blue jays. One of the birds in front of me defecated. A small puff of whitish gas was expelled along with the feces. The feces dropped from the bird while the gas wafted below and parallel to the slightly raised tail, until it dissipated rapidly into the cold air. The gas could be clearly seen against the dark-colored eave that hangs over the sheltered perches, upon which the birds were fluffed and resting. Several days later a bird perched in the same position was observed to defecate with the accompanying wisp of whitish gas. Weisbrod goes on to describe how birds eat similar diets to many mammals who definitely flatulate but explains that he could not find any other accounts of bird flatulence at that time. (And apparently no scientist has stepped up to the plate to follow up on Weisbrod’s observation.) He also acknowledges that the \"wisp of whitish gas\" could also have simply been water vapor—steam rising from the feces. (Just think of how your dog’s poop steams in the cold when you take him out for his daily business in the winter.) It’s a little difficult to know for sure that birds rarely or never fart. According to Mental_Floss, human farts are smelly due to a combination of our diets and the microbes in our guts that help digest the foods in our diets. A video by AsapSCIENCE adds that \"the longer the food stays in the gut, the more time it has to ferment\" and break down into its smellier components—namely sulfur. So if birds don’t have the right food-microbe combo and intestinal length to produce smelly gas, then we wouldn’t smell it. Without a smell, bird farts rustle no one’s feathers. But even if birds produced immaculate, odorless gas, would we hear it? That is less clear. According to a Q&A with proctologist Lester Gottesman in VICE, farts make a sound due to the composition of gas and the shape (read: tightness) of the sphincter. A lot of the gas that makes up a fart, Gottesman said, is swallowed air. And a lot of swallowed air leads to a lot of gas, which can make a bigger, beefier noise. But how much air does a swallow swallow when a swallow swallows air? As far as we could tell, this isn’t a question any scientist has specifically tried to measure. But the Daily Dot reached out to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology for answers nonetheless. According to an ornithologist there, relayed via email by the lab’s good-humored press officer Miyoko Chu, birds definitely swallow air. But he thinks they expel it via burping rather than farting. He added that he thinks birds do fart \"in some cases and would depend on what species, their diet, and whether it is observable.\" He also said that he’s never personally noticed a bird fart. Lastly, maybe they do swallow enough air that would leave most animals saying \"excuse me\" after a butt-bellow, but perhaps something about the construction of the, erm, exit point keeps it from making a sound. This is pure speculation, but maybe something about having feathers around the bird’s cloaca (its all-purpose back-end chute) helps the fart slip by unnoticed. And without a smell, bird farts rustle no one’s feathers.', 'text_b': None, 'label': True},\n",

On the surface it appears to be a minor update and its arrival was met with little ceremony. But beware, just hours after launch, it turns out iOS 9.3.2 is hiding a very nasty surprise indeed... Apple iOS 9.3.2 is bricking iPad Pros. ‘Great Features’ and ‘Nasty Surprises’ are my regular columns investigating operating system updates for the best features / biggest problems hidden behind the headlines. News of this first appeared on the popular MacRumors forums (something the site has followed up) before gathering momentum on Twitter where many users posted angry tweets demanding help from the official @AppleSupport account. So what is going on? A clear pattern is emerging: When affected devices install iOS 9.3.2 and restart users are presented with an ‘Error 56’ code which tells them to connect to iTunes. The problem is connecting to iTunes does nothing, the device is locked and forced reboots only return it the same state. As for the error code itself, according to Apple’s code guide, Error 56 is loosely described as a \"hardware issue\", which doesn’t sound like a credible explanation. Interestingly, from my initial investigations, it seems the newer iPad Pro 9.7 is affected far more often than the iPad Pro 12.7 (the two models have key feature differences). But the good news is there are reports of iPad Pro 9.7 models updating without problems and iPhones and other iPad models appear to be getting through unscathed. So what happens now? I suspect Apple will make a statement about this sooner rather than later (I’ve contacted the press team), and the two obvious paths are to a) Re-release a tweaked version of iOS 9.3.2 or b) quickly issue a new update (iOS 9.3.3?) as an emergency fix. All of which does little to aid the reputation of iOS 9 which has suffered numerous high profile problems, despite originally being a fine tuning of iOS 8 rather than offer a radical overhaul. Needless to say I’d advise everyone (regardless of whether they own an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch) to steer clear of iOS 9.3.2 until more is known. ___ More On Forbes Apple Leak Reveals \\'Edgeless Display\\' New iPhone iPhone 7 Leak Reveals Significant Feature Removed iPhone SE Vs iPhone 6S: What\\'s The Difference? iPhone SE Vs iPhone 6S Review: Which You Should Buy?

              "  {'guid': 24, 'text_a': 'Rebekah Brooks is back with Rupert Murdoch, and this time it\\'s digital - Rebekah Brooks is back with Rupert Murdoch, and this time it\\'s digital\"This one.\" Those were the words of Rupert Murdoch when asked about his top priority following the 2011 fall of News of the World in a phone hacking scandal. He was referring to Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of News International, a subsidiary of Murdoch\\'s News Corp. At the time, Brooks had just been cleared of all charges stemming from the hacking fiasco that ended with more than 100 arrests and the closure of News of the World, which she oversaw. While Brooks emerged from the scandal without formal punishment, she had resigned from News International and spent several months on the front pages of newspapers around the globe. Her reputation in tatters, it was widely believed that her image and reputation had become too toxic to ever again hold a high position at News Corp. That speculation appears to have underestimated Murdoch\\'s affinity for Brooks. Just eight months after being cleared of charges, Brooks is set to return to News Corp in a role focusing on digital media. Upward mobility Brooks enjoyed a meteoric rise through the ranks of News Corp\\'s tabloids to become one of the youngest top editors in Britain at the age of 32. Known as a sharp and aggressive journalist, Brooks was not afraid to test the limits of ethics when reporting stories. She once famously rigged a hotel room with recording devices when meeting a source who claimed to have had a sexual relationship with Princess Diana. Another time, she dressed as a cleaning lady and hid in a bathroom stall in order to get an early copy of another London paper — The Sunday Times — and then stole one of the paper\\'s scoops. Brooks\\'s hard charging ways led her to some of the highest positions at Murdoch\\'s tabloids. In 2000, she was named editor of News of the World. In 2003, she became the first female editor of The Sun. In June 2009, she took the role of chief executive as News International, a subsidiary of News Corp that operates numerous papers including The Sun and News of the World. Having risen to the top of Britain\\'s media elite, Brooks maintained friendships with many of the country\\'s most influential figures, including former Prime Minister Tony Blair, current Prime Minister David Cameron and Cameron\\'s communications director Andy Coulson, who also edited News of the World and served jail time in the coming scandal. A fall from the top, but not from grace Brooks had been under official scrutiny for her actions since 2003, but it was not until a 2009 story from The Guardian that her actions began to catch up with her. By January 2011, London law enforcement had launched a new investigation into allegations of phone hacking while Brooks led News of the World. Among the allegations was evidence that the voicemail of a murdered schoolgirl had been illegally accessed, which gave her family false hope that she was still alive. The inquiries dragged on for years, with Brooks eventually found not guilty of all charges. Brooks avoided jail time, but the damage had been done. The former editor had become the face of the out-of-contol excesses of London\\'s tabloid media. Peter Jukes, a journalist who closely followed the hacking trial, noted that Brooks\\' reputation has not recovered despite her acquittal on all charges. \"I can say that having toured around the UK talking about the trial ... the overwhelming question isn\\'t, \\'Why was Rebekah put on trial,\\' but \\'Why was she found not guilty?\\'\" Jukes said. But it was Brooks\\' bond with Murdoch that served her even after ending up as the type of tabloid fodder that she had once fed on. As the chairman and CEO of News Corp, Murdoch has been one of the most powerful global media figures for decades. His affinity for her had been the source of no shortage of reporting in the UK, with some saying that she was like a daughter to him. An odd fit Even if some people believed that Brooks would eventually return to a role at News Corp, few expected her to land at Storyful. But reports on Sunday said she would work with or oversee the subsidiary, which provides social media content to major newsrooms around the world. Storyful launched in 2010 with its headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. Founded by journalist Mark Little, the company sought to tap the emergence of citizen journalism on social media, particularly the posting of pictures and video. The company worked to find and verify this kind of content. This aggregated media would then be provided to its media partners. The startup was quickly seen as being on the cutting edge of digital journalism, particularly the use of social media and crowdsourcing to provide almost real-time coverage of breaking news. The company accrued an impressive list of clients, including the BBC, ABC and The New York Times, which use content found and vetted by Storyful. (Mashable is also a Storyful client.) News Corp bought Storyful in December 2013 for $25 million, pledging that the startup would operate as a standalone company. Storyful had been built in part on a promise of veracity and accountability in a space that had been lacking credibility. Now, with Brooks entering the fold, that promise has begun to ring hollow.

Reports from The New York Times and Wall Street Journal say that her position will include work on digital and social media initiatives broadly, with Storyful being one part of that puzzle. News Corp declined to respond to inquires about Brooks and Storyful. Brooks comes off to some as an odd fit for the role. As an editor for tabloid newspapers, she has had little experience with digital media or technology. Jukes noted similarities between Brooks\\'s new position and News Corp\\'s acquisition of MySpace for $580 million. The company later sold the social network for $35 million. \"James Murdoch acquired MySpace and it didn\\'t improve.

This is a university!’This fall, protests at Yale, Princeton, Duke and the University of Missouri — where the chancellor and system president resigned in the midst of turmoil — drew national attention to the concerns many students have about how minorities are treated on campus. The protests have also prompted debate about freedom of speech and whether students should be protected from words and ideas that make them uncomfortable. Everett Piper, president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University, weighed in with a letter to the campus community: This past week, I actually had a student come forward after a university chapel service and complain because he felt \"victimized\" by a sermon on the topic of 1 Corinthians 13. It appears that this young scholar felt offended because a homily on love made him feel bad for not showing love! In his mind, the speaker was wrong for making him, and his peers, feel uncomfortable. I’m not making this up. Our culture has actually taught our kids to be this self-absorbed and narcissistic! Any time their feelings are hurt, they are the victims! Anyone who dares challenge them and, thus, makes them \"feel bad\" about themselves, is a \"hater,\" a \"bigot,\" an \"oppressor,\" and a \"victimizer.\" I have a message for this young man and all others who care to listen. That feeling of discomfort you have after listening to a sermon is called a conscience! An altar call is supposed to make you feel bad! It is supposed to make you feel guilty! The goal of many a good sermon is to get you to confess your sins — not coddle you in your selfishness. The primary objective of the Church and the Christian faith is your confession, not your self-actualization! So here’s my advice: If you want the chaplain to tell you you’re a victim rather than tell you that you need virtue, this may not be the university you’re looking for. If you want to complain about a sermon that makes you feel less than loving for not showing love, this might be the wrong place. If you’re more interested in playing the \"hater\" card than you are in confessing your own hate; if you want to arrogantly lecture, rather than humbly learn; if you don’t want to feel guilt in your soul when you are guilty of sin; if you want to be enabled rather than confronted, there are many universities across the land (in Missouri and elsewhere) that will give you exactly what you want, but Oklahoma Wesleyan isn’t one of them. At OKWU, we teach you to be selfless rather than self-centered. We are more interested in you practicing personal forgiveness than political revenge. We want you to model interpersonal reconciliation rather than foment personal conflict. We believe the content of your character is more important than the color of your skin. We don’t believe that you have been victimized every time you feel guilty and we don’t issue \"trigger warnings\" before altar calls. Oklahoma Wesleyan is not a \"safe place\", but rather, a place to learn: to learn that life isn’t about you, but about others; that the bad feeling you have while listening to a sermon is called guilt; that the way to address it is to repent of everything that’s wrong with you rather than blame others for everything that’s wrong with them.

The decision upheld the Federal Communications Commission\\'s (FCC) regulation that supports net neutrality. Net neutrality means that the Internet service providers or broadband carriers treat all data that travels over their networks in exactly the same way, much like our telephone service and power are regulated. It’s the way the Internet has worked since its inception and we know how the Internet has transformed our lives in nearly everything we do. It’s also spawned innovation and many new companies to create products and services we never imagined. But for many years, there has been an effort to change all this, led by the broadband carriers Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T. They\\'ve wanted to offer different classes of Internet services, one that provides faster speeds and better access to those websites that pay, and a slower access speed for those that don\\'t want to pay. It was a way for these companies with with limited competition to generate more revenue, but it would also mean that the bigger companies that could pay more for faster service would receive preferential treatment for their content, compared to smaller startup companies that could not afford to pay. Three years ago when these rules were being formulated by the FCC, a groundswell of users spoke up in support of net neutrality, more than any other regulation in recent history. Four million citizens emailed and called the FCC objecting to any changes away from net neutrality. When comedian John Oliver explained on HBO’s \"Last Week Tonight\" what was being proposed that might compromise net neutrality, it generated 45,000 responses to the agency in just a few minutes. Opposition also came from the major technology companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Netflix. The Internet Association , the organization representing nearly 40 tech companies, including those above, also filed a formal petition in opposition. They want companies to compete by being able to attract customers based on their products and services, not on speed of access.

This finding suggests that, one day, it may be possible to find samples of what the primordial Earth was like before the giant impact that formed the moon, or to uncover bits of the impacting rock itself. Earth was born about 4.5 billion years ago, and scientists think the moon formed shortly afterward. The leading explanation for the moon\\'s origin, known as the giant impact hypothesis, suggests that the moon resulted from the collision of two protoplanets, or embryonic worlds. One of those was the young Earth, and the other was a potentially Mars-size object called Theia. The moon then coalesced from the rubble. [How Earth\\'s Moon Was Made (A Photo Timeline)] \"By understanding the moon, we can tell the story of the early bombardment of Earth,\" study lead author William Bottke, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, told Space.com. However, the precise timeline of this giant impact event is under dispute. The ages of the most ancient lunar samples the Apollo astronauts brought back are still debated, since these samples have typically been battered and heated by subsequent cosmic impacts. \"To understand the formation and evolution of our world as well as those in the inner solar system, we need to understand the timing of major events during the planet-formation era,\" Bottke said. To find out more about this giant impact, scientists developed a computer model of the event. They found that the impact not only created a disk of debris near Earth that formed the moon, but it also ejected huge amounts of rubble — as much as several percent of Earth\\'s mass — away from Earth and the moon. The simulations found that numerous fragments from the moon-forming impact — hundreds of millions of which were at least a mile (1.6 kilometers) long — blasted the asteroid belt, striking asteroids there at speeds of more than 22,370 mph (36,000 km/h), more than twice as fast as typical crashes in the belt. These collisions from the moon-forming impact would have generated superheated material, the researchers said. \"In an explosion, there is often collateral damage, where nearby buildings and innocent bystanders are affected,\" Bottke said. \"Investigators can learn about the explosive device and the explosion itself by studying what happened to people, infrastructure, and whether trace amounts of the explosive device can be found among the blast damage. Here, the \\'innocent bystanders\\' were the main-belt asteroids.\" Collisions against these asteroids in more recent times returned these remnants to Earth in stony meteorites, which the scientists now have analyzed and used to date the age of the impact. \"In a sense, the asteroid belt has been an eyewitness to multiple \\'drive-by shootings\\' from the earliest time in solar system history,\" Bottke said. \"By reading the traces left behind, we can use asteroid samples to tell us who did it, when they did it and how they did it.\" The researchers deduced that the moon-forming impact occurred about 4.47 billion years ago, in agreement with many previous estimates. \"We can now use asteroids, for the first time, to tell us about many of the major events that took place in the inner solar system during the planet-formation era,\" Bottke said. \"This gives us a new window on a time period which has been virtually unknown up to now.\" This research \"raises the intriguing possibility that trace amounts of the primordial Earth or moon-forming impactor called Theia may still be found on asteroids today, or possibly within some of our meteorites,\" Bottke said. \"It may be simply a matter of looking and asking the right questions. Finding these materials would be one of the Holy Grails of geology — we have no rocks older than 4 billion years old on Earth, and no one knows the exact nature of the original building blocks of our planet.\" If future research can uncover examples of this impact in asteroid samples, \"possibly by getting them from an asteroid sample return mission like OSIRIS-REx, we would have one of the key pieces of the puzzle explaining why our world is the way it is, and what has changed since its infancy,\" Bottke said.

Work, especially in this digital age, follows you around. Still, it\\'s worth noting this moment.

This riff in response to Republican criticism of how Obama describes the threat posed by the Islamic State militant group, which is also known as ISIS and ISIL, captures his view on perception politics nicely: For a while now, the main contribution of some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have made in the fight against ISIL is to criticize this administration and me for not using the phrase \"radical Islam.\" That’s the key, they tell us — we can’t beat ISIL unless we call them \"radical Islamists.\" What exactly would using this label accomplish? What exactly would it change? Would it make ISIL less committed to trying to kill Americans? Would it bring in more allies? Is there a military strategy that is served by this? The answer is none of the above. Calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away. This is a political distraction... ...There has not been a moment in my seven and a half years as president where we have not been able to pursue a strategy because we didn’t use the label \"radical Islam.\" Not once has an adviser of mine said, man, if we really use that phrase, we\\'re going to turn this whole thing around.

Wellington-based journalist Ben Collins asks whether New Zealand is becoming a \"utopia\" for Americans looking to leave. Forget bunkers in the forest full of food tins and bottled water - it seems New Zealand, with a population of 4.4 million, has become the best option for a new breed of American survivalist. When the New Zealand Herald revealed this week that Silicon Valley tech billionaire Peter Thiel had become a citizen and purchased a lake-front estate it perhaps shouldn\\'t have been a surprise. Mr Thiel, who previously said New Zealand was a \"utopia\" and has invested heavily there, is just one of several US migrants who have realised what the country has to offer. Punching above its weight New Zealand recently overtook Singapore as the best place to do business, according to the World Bank. Transparency International ranks it as the world\\'s least corrupt country, and the 2016 Global Peace Index said it was the fourth safest behind Iceland, Denmark and Austria. \"We\\'ve definitely had an increase in American inquiries, and at least one sale that has been a direct run-off from the presidential result in the United States,\" says Nick Horton, an agent specialising in luxury real estate. \"There\\'s just a feeling that people want to create a bolthole in the southern hemisphere that\\'s away from some of the problems facing the Western world,\" he says. Recently, the New Yorker magazine ran a piece titled Doomsday Prep for the Super-rich. It detailed the rise in wealthy investors who see New Zealand as their escape from a volatile world. It is safe and clean. The west coast of the United States is a 13-hour flight away, and modern technology has tamed the tyranny of distance. The temperate, mountainous country is also comparably well-placed to deal with rising sea levels, and its most recent major attack was in 1985, when French spies blew up a Greenpeace vessel in Auckland harbour. However, as Horton explains, the interest from the United States is not new. \"The same happened after the global financial crisis, and the same thing happened after Obama was elected, when some people thought the United States wouldn\\'t tolerate having a black leader.\" US surge According to Immigration New Zealand, in November 2016 when the US presidential election was held, 17,584 people registered their interest to study, work or invest in the country, compared with 1,272 in November 2015. In the two days following the election, the agency said its website received 88,353 visits from the United States - compared to a usual daily average of 2,300 visits a day. Registrations have remained higher than average, with 3,159 received this month, compared to 1,724 in January 2016. However, registrations are far higher than actual visa applications. Between October and December last year, 348 residency visas were granted to people from the United States, compared with 338 in the same period in 2015. Work visas rose from 2,296 to 2,699 over the same period. \"What we are experiencing at the moment is a slight increase in visas issued to American nationals, both temporary work visas and permanent resident visas,\" Steve McGill, general manager at Immigration New Zealand, told the BBC. \"We have had a pretty active strategy of identifying investors out of America over the past few years. \"It\\'s a combination of our marketing effort, and a bit of global uncertainty that means New Zealand is a pretty attractive place,\" Mr McGill said. The revelation that Mr Thiel had quietly become a New Zealand citizen has raised some questions about the processes for foreign investors, with some politicians asking how, exactly, he was able to secure it and whether he was given special treatment. But Mr McGill said opposition to wealthy investors, who can secure a residency visa by spending a minimum amount in the country, was not a major issue. \"I am aware of the recent commentary around Mr Thiel, but there is no evidence of any backlash against migrant investors coming in. What we do know is that many of the investors who come out deliver significant value in the form of job creation in the communities. \"We are a small island nation at the bottom of the world with lots of resources and opportunities and we need to maximise that, and some of the way we can do that is bringing in investors,\" he said. Better lifestyle It isn\\'t just the mega-wealthy that are attracted to New Zealand. Sarah Coombes-Crome, an immigration consultant, said that traffic to her firm\\'s website was up approximately 600% the day after Donald Trump won the election and has remained higher than average. \"They are from all over the United States and are educated, looking to either work in New Zealand or invest if they have a considerable amount of capital behind them.\" \"I think New Zealand and the United States are very similar,\" she said. \"They are both English speaking countries, they think similar, they have the same values and similar religious beliefs.

As John Adams himself wrote to his wife upon his becoming the second president in 1797, the transfer of power was \"the sublimest Thing ever exhibited in America.\" But while Adams was the first to experience that transition, it wasn\\'t until four years later that the principle was put to the test. After all, George Washington didn\\'t want to run again for the 1796 election and Adams kept power within the same party. In 1800, on the other hand , the United States saw its first hotly contested election and its first transfer of power between political parties. The result was close, and it also left Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr tied, with the House spending a week deciding who would be President. (At the time, the Vice President was whoever came in second.) It was easily conceivable that the entire system would fall apart, but instead Jefferson became President and his rivals—the incumbent Adams as well as Burr—accepted the result. As Jefferson would later write , the \"revolution of 1800\" was a big deal: [It was] as real a revolution in the principles of our government as that of 1776 was in its form; not effected indeed by the sword, as that, but by the rational and peaceable instrument of reform, the suffrage of the people. The nation declared its will by dismissing functionaries of one principle, and electing those of another, in the two branches, executive and legislative, submitted to their election. This principle—that the nation declares its will by voting, and the functionaries of government peacefully accept the choice—has even been upheld when perhaps the candidate might have wished to do otherwise. For example, some believe that the 1960 presidential election was subject to substantial enough voting irregularities that Richard Nixon should have won. (In fact, there is no concrete evidence either way .) But, even though it was an extremely close race and some of his supporters urged him to fight the result, Nixon decided that, in keeping with tradition, it was better to accept the fact that early returns indicated John F Kennedy had won. In a late-night speech to supporters, he explained why: As all of you in this room know, and as all of you millions who are listening on television and radio realize, it is normally the custom for a candidate for the Presidency...not to appear until after the decision is definitely known, and all the votes are counted beyond doubt. However, I have been keeping some pretty late hours recently as some of you have...I know too that many who are listening in the Eastern part of the United States will find that it is now about 3:15 in the morning... I want to say that one of the great features of America is that we have political contests, that they are very hard fought, as this one was hard fought, and once the decision is made, we unite behind the man who is elected... I want Senator Kennedy to know, and I want all of you to know, that certainly if this trend continues, and if he does become our next President, he will have my whole-hearted support. That tradition even held true in 2000. As TIME\\'s David Von Drehle has pointed out , that year\\'s concession from Al Gore to George W. Bush was a long time in coming not because Gore refused to accept the results of the vote, but because there was no result to accept yet. In fact, when it became clear what the result would be, Gore followed the precedent of hundreds of years\\' worth of elections, as he peacefully accepted the outcome of the vote. As he explained in his concession speech, that was what patriotism required: Almost a century and a half ago, Senator Stephen Douglas told Abraham Lincoln, who had just defeated him for the presidency, \\'\\'Partisan feeling must yield to patriotism. I\\'m with you, Mr. President, and God bless you.\\'\\' Well, in that same spirit, I say to President-elect Bush that what remains of partisan rancor must now be put aside, and may God bless his stewardship of this country. Neither he nor I anticipated this long and difficult road. Certainly neither of us wanted it to happen. Yet it came, and now it has ended, resolved, as it must be resolved, through the honored institutions of our democracy. That doesn\\'t mean the tradition has always been honored by everyone. In 1860, after Abraham Lincoln was elected, Stephen Douglas (the runner-up for the popular vote) had cause to utter those words later quoted by Gore, as he conceded the result. But, even before the election took place, the South had already warned the nation that a victory by Lincoln and the Republican Party would be unacceptable in their eyes. South Carolina seceded from the Union that December, declaring that the North was \"united in the election of a man to the high office of President of the United States whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery.\" Rather than accept the electoral result, the state convention announced that \"public opinion at the North has invested a great political error\" and that South Carolina would not go along with the outcome.

Albuquerque is celebrating the one year anniversary of the city’s successful \"There’s a Better Way\" program. (Albuquerque Mayor\\'s Office) Republican Mayor Richard Berry was driving around Albuquerque last year when he saw a man on a street corner holding a sign that read: \"Want a Job. Anything Helps.\" Throughout his administration, as part of a push to connect the homeless population to services, Berry had taken to driving through the city to talk to panhandlers about their lives. His city’s poorest residents told him they didn’t want to be on the streets begging for money, but they didn’t know where else to go. Seeing that sign gave Berry an idea. Instead of asking them, many of whom feel dispirited, to go out looking for work, the city could bring the work to them. Next month will be the first anniversary of Albuquerque’s There’s a Better Way program, which hires panhandlers for day jobs beautifying the city.

And more than 100 people have been connected to permanent employment. \"You can just see the spiral they’ve been on to end up on the corner.

A Berry’s effort is a shift from the movement across the country to criminalize panhandling. A recent National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty report found a noticeable increase, with 24 percent of cities banning it altogether and 76 percent banning it in particular areas. There is a persisting stigma that people begging for money are either drug addicts or too lazy to work and are looking for an easy handout. But that’s not necessarily the reality. Panhandling is not especially lucrative, but for some people it can seem as if it’s the only option. When they’ve been approached in Albuquerque with the offer of work, most have been eager for the opportunity to earn money, Berry said. They just needed a lift. One man told him no one had said a kind word to him in 25 years. Kellie Tillerson, director of Employment Services at St. Martin’s Hospitality Center, the organization that facilitates the city’s program, said the way to dispel people of the negative associations with panhandlers is for them to do what the mayor did and engage on a human level. Kellie Tillerson, director of Employment Services at St. Martin’s Hospitality Center, the organization that facilitates the city’s program, said the way to dispel people of the negative associations with panhandlers is for them to do what the mayor did and engage on a human level. \"Genuinely ask why they are in the predicament they are,\" Tillerson said. \"Many have medical conditions, they don’t have the proper identification — you can’t get a job without one. They don’t have a Social Security card. Those little things we take for granted prohibit people from getting a job. Don’t assume they are lazy.\" The There’s a Better Way van employs about 10 workers a day but could easily take more. When the van fills, people have begged to get a spot next time, she said. That’s why the city has increased funding for the program to expand it from two to four days a week. And it inspired St. Martin’s to start its own day labor program, connecting the jobless to employers in the area who could offer side jobs. Tillerson said a lot of the people who get picked up by the van were not aware of all the services available to them. One man who recently got out of prison returned to St. Martin’s the day after taking one of the city’s jobs. She said it enrolled him in the day-labor program, told him about behavioral health services and are helping him get an ID. \"He now has a support system he didn’t know he needed and definitely didn’t know existed,\" she said. \"It’s life-changing for them. He was one that said, ‘I would much rather earn my money than have someone hand it to me.’ \" Dozens of cities around the country have reached out to Berry wanting to copy the program. It’s a testament, he said, to the work mayors do regardless of political party. He was the first Republican mayor elected in Albuquerque in 30 years, and he’s proactively tackling homelessness. The program hasn’t weeded out all panhandling in the city, and supporters say that’s not really the point. It’s connecting people who would otherwise not seek help to needed services. And it’s showing them when they are at their lowest that they have real value, and that others are willing to show them kindness to help them have a better life. \"It’s helping hundreds of people,\" Berry said, \"and our city is more beautiful than ever.\"', 'text_b': None, 'label': True},\n",

It\\'s a method used in accounting, and, wait for it, at the grocery store. When the supermarket gets fresh milk in stock, for example, they place the older stuff in front and the newer stuff behind it.

Here\\'s what you need to do with that information: use this method at home. Putting away the groceries can sometimes feel like the worst part of this essential kitchen chore, so it\\'s understandable if you just shove the groceries into the fridge without a second thought. We get it, but stop. Instead, move all the perishable older goods to the front and place the newer groceries behind them.

There’s only one way to stop it happeningI hate to be an alarmist, but Donald Trump could be on course to be elected president of the United States – and the decisive moment may well come on Monday night. That’s when he faces hate to be an alarmist, but Donald Trump could be on course to be elected president of the United States – and the decisive moment may well come on Monday night. That’s when he faces Hillary Clinton in what is expected to be one of the most watched events in television history. The TV debates are perhaps the last chance for her to persuade the American people that this man is unqualified for, and unworthy of, the presidency and poses a genuine threat to the republic. If that sounds like panic, then I’m not the only one. Sweaty-palmed nausea has become a leading symptom among those who tremble at the prospect of a Trump presidency. A new Slate podcast is called Time to Panic . Number cruncher Nate Silver, who gives Trump a 40% probability of winning, triggered another round of liberal angst this week when he tweeted that he had \"Never seen otherwise smart people in so much denial about something as they are about Trump’s chances. Same mistake as primaries, Brexit.\" Never seen otherwise smart people in so much denial as they are about Trump’s chances. Same mistake as Brexit Nate Silver The source of the alarm is not so much the national polls, where Clinton is a few points ahead, but surveys from those battleground states where the presidency will be decided. In the last week, polls have put Trump in front in Ohio, Nevada, North Carolina and, most neuralgic of all, Florida. So low are expectations for his performance on Monday – where it is assumed that his opponent, a seasoned debater, will wipe the floor with him – that if Trump manages to speak in vaguely coherent sentences and not deliver a misogynist insult to Clinton’s face, his advocates will declare that he looked \"presidential\" and anoint him the winner. If he can somehow persuade wavering voters that he is not so ridiculous as to merit automatic disqualification, he will have cleared a crucial hurdle. And for all her experience, Clinton heads towards this first, and therefore most important, debate facing some serious obstacles. She’s been advised that she mustn’t interrupt too much or talk over Trump: apparently voters react badly to seeing a woman act that way. According to a New York Times report well sourced from inside Hillary’s debate preparation team, \"she does not want to be seen as pushy and play into gender stereotypes\". This was not something Barack Obama, or husband Bill, ever had to worry about. Activists in Berlin dismantle what they called a Wall of Hate showing Donald Trump in front of the Brandenburg Gate on 23 September. But Trump himself presents her with an unprecedented conundrum. How does she take on a candidate who lies and lies and lies? One reporter following Trump has taken to logging the falsehoods he tells each day: no small task. Take two areas where you’d assume that to be caught in untruth would be terminal for a presidential candidate. Trump has been exposed for serial lying over 9/11 , falsely claiming to have lost hundreds of friends that day; to have seen thousands of Muslims cheering the fall of the twin towers; and to have helped in the rescue effort. He even milked cash from a 9/11 relief fund. This week he was found to have raided $258,000 from the charitable foundation that bears his name to settle assorted legal problems. Earlier he dipped into that same charity box, filled by others’ donations, to pay for a larger than life $10,000 painting – of himself. He lies about 9/11. He lies about charity. But on he strides. But Trump himself presents her with an unprecedented conundrum. How does she take on a candidate who lies and lies and lies?’ So where can Hillary begin? If she calls him a liar, he’ll hit back over her use of a private email server, calling her Crooked Hillary, knowing that some 60% of Americans believe she’s dishonest. The risk is that he’ll use her experience and expertise against her, casting her as the boring know-it-all against the freewheeling, entertaining guy who relies on good old gut instinct. If that sounds familiar, that’s because it’s a show we’ve already seen. In 2000 Al Gore was clearly the more accomplished, ready-for-office candidate. But he came across as impatient and pompous against the looser, backslapping George W Bush. Never mind that one was a visionary on the issue of climate change while the other would lead the US into the catastrophic invasion of Iraq. On the night, Bush came across better on TV. Which brings us to a core problem facing Hillary Clinton. Polls show there are millions of voters, especially young ones, who agree in big numbers that Trump is a racist and a sexist, unqualified for America’s highest office – but who are refusing to back Clinton. One survey of 18- to 34-year-olds recorded dire numbers for Trump, but still found only 31% supporting Clinton, with 29% preferring libertarian Gary Johnson and 15% the Green candidate Jill Stein. If those numbers are replicated on election day, Trump will win. This too stirs queasy memories of 2000. In that year, a small but significant bloc on the left voted for Ralph Nader instead of Gore. More than 90,000 voted for Nader in Florida, a state Gore was eventually deemed to have lost by just 537 votes. Had even a tiny fraction of those Naderites decided to hold their nose and choose Gore instead, there would have been no Bush presidency – and no Iraq war. I know this is a sore, and contested, point among those who chose Nader, who to this day blame Gore for not doing enough to appeal to the left (forgetting perhaps that he also had to appeal to centrist voters in order to win the election). But the basic case is surely clear. In a two-party system like America’s, if you want to stop Trump, then a vote for Johnson or Stein will not do it. Only a vote for Clinton can prevent a white nationalist bigot becoming the next US president. You might think this is all so obvious that it barely needs stating. But 2000 can seem like ancient history to those who don’t remember it. And here, younger voters are not to blame. Older liberals haven’t seared the Bush calamity into the minds of the next generation. They never turned 2000 into a cautionary tale of the cost of third-party indulgence. As the New Republic put it this week, \"Liberals have failed to teach millennials about the horror of George W Bush.\" (Republicans, meanwhile, bang on about the supposedly dismal presidency of Jimmy Carter to this day, just as British Conservatives invoked the 1979 \"winter of discontent\" for over three decades. It is the centre-left that is oddly reticent about exploiting its opponents’ history of failure.) So now, even though the hour is late, this is the case Democrats must make. That this is an exceptional election because Donald Trump represents an exceptional menace, to America and to the world. It is indeed a referendum on Trump and the only way to vote no in that referendum is to vote Clinton. She may not be the candidate of your dreams, but she’s all that stands between you and an American nightmare. You don’t have to love her. You don’t even have to like her. You’re not saying she’s flawless (though the current Democratic platform is its most progressive in 30 years, thanks in part to the challenge of Bernie Sanders). As Joe Biden puts it, \"Don’t compare her to the Almighty. Compare her to the alternative.\" And the alternative is President Trump.', 'text_b': None, 'label': True},\n",

And, as is usual pattern, more and more credible leaks have come out about what will presumably be called the iPhone 7 Bloomberg probably has the most accurate reporting thus far (thanks to its hiring of Apple reporter Mark Gurman) in a report that basically confirms what has leaked out about the iPhone over the next few months. The big news is that the form factor will remain largely the same, there will be a dual-lens camera system for the larger iPhone, and the home button will provide haptic feedback rather than depress like a physical button. Oh yeah, and the headphone jack ? It\\'s dead. Dunzo Let\\'s all take a moment of silence for the headphone jack. Not to downplay the new stuff (though I have thoughts on that, just wait), it\\'s worth noting that this follows my playbook for bulletproof iPhone predictions to a tee. In case you need a reminder, this is what we can always expect from a new iPhone: It will be Apple\\'s fastest iPhone ever. It will have Apple\\'s most advanced optics. There will be at least one extra feature you can\\'t get on any other iPhone. It will come in rose gold. And now, I guess we can add, \"it won\\'t have a headphone jack.\" Still, I\\'m sure I\\'m not the only person who looks at the leaks of the next iPhone and says, \"Huh. OK.\" \\ue600 \\ue601 \\ue602 \\ue605 If we\\'re being honest, this probably won\\'t be the most exciting iPhone release we\\'ve seen. This isn\\'t to say I won\\'t still buy the next iPhone — I\\'m TOTALLY going to buy the new iPhone in September — but if we\\'re being honest, this probably won\\'t be the most exciting iPhone release we\\'ve seen. Personally, I think that\\'s OK. I\\'m not completely sure how I feel about Apple potentially shifting the design upgrade from every two years to every three — new colors aside, that makes it really hard to show off that you\\'ve got the latest and greatest phone — but now that we\\'re nearly a decade into the modern smartphone era, it might not be realistic to expect new designs every other year. Regardless of what other whiz-bang goodness Apple introduces this year — and I\\'m sure there will be at least one feature that will make even the most jaded amongst us salivate — the reality is that this will absolutely be the iPhone remembered as \"the one where Apple dropped the headphone jack.\" That\\'s it. Pack it up. Waterproof casing, wireless charging, better battery life and more powerful optics could all be things we see. And these would be amazing upgrades — old design or not — but the real headline is that this is the first iPhone without a headphone jack. I can say with absolute certainty that every major review of the device is going to focus substantially on this fact. And thinking about it, I have to wonder: Is Apple making such an enormous and potentially unpopular change this year so that next year\\'s iPhone — you know, the one that might have an all-glass display and an ultra-sharp AMOLED screen — won\\'t suffer? That\\'s the phone that might ditch the home button altogether. It\\'s also the phone that will coincidentally be released the same year as the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone. And Apple loves to celebrate anniversaries. \\ue600 \\ue601 \\ue602 \\ue605 A 20th Anniversary Edition Macintosh from 1997. Fun fact: This was one of the first product designs from Jony Ive. Image: Christie\\'s auction house Downplaying the iPhone 7 so the NEXT iPhone can thrive Maybe I\\'m reading too much into the tea leaves, but it strikes me that Apple could be deliberately cutting the headphone jack this year — a year that is already going to be less exciting by virtue of no major redesign — in order to protect the next iPhone from the inevitable backlash over the headphone jack\\'s removal. \\ue600 \\ue601 \\ue602 \\ue605 The backlash will be angrier than when Apple changed from the 30-pin connector to the Lightning port. Yes, yes, I\\'ve been telling everyone to accept that the headphone jack is dead since January . A frequent point of discussion on our podcast, MashTalk , has been about the headphone jack and where all of us are in facing reality. Even Tech Editor Pete Pachal has come around to see the light. The jack is dead. And there will be backlash. The backlash will be angrier than when Apple changed from the 30-pin connector to the Lightning port (making all of those old dock accessories obsolete) and the rallying cry from pundits is already louder than it was when Apple decided to not include a floppy drive on the original iMac. I feel very certain that, backlash aside, the ultimate fallout of a headphone jack-free iPhone will be minimal. People will grumble. Adapters will be annoying and we\\'ll all bitch and moan about how Bluetooth just isn\\'t good enough. But we\\'ll survive and within a year, most of us will be used to using either Lightning headphones, dongles or snazzy wireless options. We\\'ll have moved on. Which of course, means that the buzz around the 2017 iPhone will be all positive. New design, new screen and some other snazzy feature. But that missing headphone jack? So last year\\'s problem. And that\\'s why, the more I think about it, the more I feel like the iPhone 7 has to be a little bit boring so that we can get really hyped about the next big iPhone, and it needs to drop the headphone jack now, so the 10th anniversary iPhone doesn\\'t carry that particular scarlet letter. Despite the inevitable death of the headphone jack, I\\'m still going to buy the iPhone 7. But I mostly just want to get this release over with so I can start looking forward to the iPhone 8.

              "  {'guid': 135, 'text_a': 'How One Theory You Never Heard of Explains Everything Donald Trump Does - How One Theory You Never Heard of Explains Everything Donald Trump DoesWhen Donald Trump declared his candidacy for president a year ago, Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight political blog said he had \"a better chance of cameoing in another ‘Home Alone’ movie with Macaulay Culkin—or playing in the NBA Finals—than winning the Republican nomination.\" With a net favorability rating of -32 percent according to FiveThirtyEight and \"exactly zero\" chance of winning, according to The Atlantic, how has Trump seemingly emerged victorious from a pool of 17 Republican hopefuls? To try to answer that question would be to travel down a rabbit hole of speculation that has swallowed so many. One thing is sure, though: While Donald Trump has thus far appeared to accomplish the impossible, even he has limits. The reality is that Trump—like policymakers and politicians past, present and future—is operating within the confines of the Overton Window of Political Possibility. The Overton Window: When You Think About It, It’s So True... This theory, named for the late Joseph P. Overton of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, is a way to explain how opinions about public policies shift over time and the constraints within which policymakers operate. The Overton Window is the spectrum of ideas that are politically palatable to voters. Although there is no limit to the number of policy ideas available, elected officials are limited to only actively supporting ideas within this window. For example, consider federal welfare policy. Even though there are loads of ideas about how to address poverty in the United States, politicians support and debate only a select few, such as the minimum wage, earned income tax credit, Medicaid, etc. These are within the Overton Window. Other ideas, such as a guaranteed basic income, even though they may be debated in other countries and supported by economists on both the left and the right, are never seriously considered by politicians because they lie outside the window. Trump’s Public Policy, Explained With this in mind, now consider Trump’s recent about-face after he said the victims of the recent Orlando shooting should have been permitted to carry guns into the Pulse nightclub. About a week after making the statement, Trump appeared to backtrack and said he meant nightclub employees and guards should have been armed, not patrons. This wasn’t just a flip-flop or mere pandering — it’s more likely that Trump’s movement on the issue is evidence he realized his initial stance was a step outside the Overton Window. While many of his supporters are no doubt staunch believers in the Second Amendment, even the NRA—which endorsed him—said, \"No one thinks that people should go into a nightclub drinking and carrying firearms.\" Using the Overton Window Theory to Your Advantage It is important to remember that politicians rarely move the window; more often than not, they only support policies that are deemed acceptable by their constituents. When Trump said Orlando nightclub patrons should have been armed, the backlash showed him that position was outside the window, so he stepped his stance back to one more acceptable to voters. The lesson in all this is that politicians, as Friedrich Hayek once wrote, are like corks bobbing in the sea. They only go where the current leads them, and it is us — you, me and our neighbors — who determine the direction of the current. In other words, if you want to see policy change—if you want to expand the Overton Window—appeal to the hearts and minds of your fellow citizens and the politicians will soon follow.', 'text_b': None, 'label': True},\n",

Shevchenko was at a restaurant, Campero’s Chicken Grill, with her coach Pavel Fedotov, when a group of men stormed the place. The men demanded that any money on the premises be handed over, as well as personal belongings that the customers had on their person. The area is relatively known for high crime, in fact this was the fifth time that Campero’s Chicken Grill has been robbed. It is believed that the men were extremely violent, beating people who refused to hand their personal belongings over. Reports have confirmed that Shevchenko’s coach, Pavel Fedotov, was armed with a gun and decided to take matters into his own hands. Firing at the group of men, Fedotov allegedly killed one of the men. He was then shot himself in the stomach, where he was rushed to hospital for treatment.

The pair then fittingly rented a \"Bond-inspired\" Jaguar and visited Hiddleston\\'s old stomping grounds, taking time to stroll on the beach with Hiddleston\\'s mother and sister. As with all outings since this blossoming relationship started, it was faithfully documented by the paparazzi at a very close proximity, which is a real boon since Taylor has adopted a charming English country style since linking up with Hiddleston.

The bad news is that it involves women pretending that they are men. In a column in the Wall Street Journal, John Greathouse of Rincon Venture Partners outlined his belief that women will get more opportunities in tech if they \"create an online presence that obscures their gender.\" Bizarrely equating hiring practices in tech to blind orchestra auditions, Greathouse suggested that women do things like only use their first initial and eliminate photos on both Twitter and LinkedIn. Rather than call on tech companies to overcome the unconscious bias that can too easily be baked into hiring practices, Greathouse thinks women should solve the problem themselves by hiding who they really are. \"[The column] made me really mad.\" said Angela Dalton , a managing director at Guggenheim. \"It’s wrong on so many levels. It perpetuates the trap that women fall into that if I put my head down and just work, I will get noticed... Success is competency, yes, but it’s also personality and warmth.\" I sat down with Dalton as well as three other female investors for a panel discussion today at TAP , a tech conference in New York. The topic of our chat was the future of mobile investing, but with the industry abuzz with disbelief about the column, our conversation inevitably changed direction. [Greathouse did not respond to an email I sent him requesting comment. In a tweet, he apologized for the column.] Heidi Roizen , an operating partner at DFJ, said that when she started in venture capital, she was routinely the only woman in the room. After becoming aware of the gender bias that pervades the tech industry, Roizen decided to give her two children gender-neutral names. That way when their applied to jobs later in life, the recruiter wouldn’t know if they were male or female. \"This is sad, but it is also true,\" said Roizen. \"Yes we did to change things, but we need to recognize the reality for what it is.\" Nimi Katragadda , a principal at BoxGroup, agreed with Roizen that you can’t ignore the problem, but said that hiding your identity entirely to overcome bias was \"asinine’ advice. \"Why should you hide your identity because the person on the other end of the table is backwards?\" she said. \"You are making the problem worse that way.\" The fact that all the investors on stage for my panel were women was not an accident. In fact, the conference organizers were trying to combat the gender gap in tech by doing the exact opposite of what Greathouse suggested. After having a difficult time recruiting female speakers for last year’s conference -- a problem that plagues most tech events -- the organizers intentionally set out with the goal of having more than 50% female speakers. Highlighting female voices was the conference’s way of signaling to leaders in the room that diversity in leadership roles should be a priority. \"We know that companies that have diverse teams do better,\" said Susanne Greenfield , a Director at Priceline Group. \"But there is this unconscious bias. People want to hire and promote people who are similar to them. You have to do something to fight that bias.\" As a LinkedIn editor, I regularly work with thought leaders in tech who share their insights on our publishing platform. Rather than encourage female writers to mask their identity and experiences, I suggest they own it. In order to combat the misguided notion that the tech industry is only comprised of male leaders, women must share their expertise on social networks so that audiences hear a diverse set of perspectives. To get more women interested in pursuing careers in technology, current female leaders must continue to strive to be seen, rather than hide like Greathouse suggests.', 'text_b': None, 'label': True},\n",
              "  {'guid': 156, 'text_a': 'Scientists say this behavior can make men more attractive to women - Scientists say this behavior can make men more attractive to womenScores of psychological studies suggest that, for guys, attractiveness isn\\'t just about the way you look. From being a talented musician to walking a dog, there are plenty of traits and behaviors that can amp up your sex appeal to women — especially if you\\'re looking to land a long-term relationship. A growing body of research on romantic attraction has focused on the importance of altruism: Men who display helping behaviors are generally perceived as more attractive than those who don\\'t. In a 2013 study on the topic, researchers had young, heterosexual men and women rate pictures of other men and women on how attractive they would be for short- and long-term relationships. Some of the people pictured were said to engage in altruistic behaviors, such as volunteering at a homeless shelter. Other people pictured were described in neutral ways, such as \"loves Chinese food.\" Both men and women rated the altruistic people as more attractive for long-term relationships — but women showed a stronger preference for altruism than men did. More recent research suggests that altruism could be even more appealing than good looks. In a study published this year, researchers looked exclusively at heterosexual women\\'s preferences for attractiveness and altruism in men. About 200 women were asked to look at photographs of men\\'s faces. Half those faces had been determined to be extremely physically attractive; the other half had been determined to be extremely physically unattractive. The women saw two pairs of faces at a time, one attractive and one unattractive. Each pair of faces was displayed alongside a description of a scenario and how each man behaved. For example: \"two people are walking through a busy town and see a homeless person sitting near a cafe.\" One man goes into the cafe and buys a sandwich and tea for the homeless person; the other man pretends to use his cellphone and walks straight past the homeless person. All the women were asked to rate each man on how attractive he was for a short- or long-term relationship. The researchers walked away with several key findings. First, as previous research had found, altruistic men were more attractive than nonaltruistic men. Second, altruistic men were more attractive for long-term than short-term relationships. When it came to short-term relationships, nonaltruistic men were in fact more desirable than altruistic men. Perhaps the most striking finding was that altruism appeared to be even more appealing than physical attractiveness when it came to long-term relationships. Unattractive men high in altruism were rated more attractive for long-term relationships than attractive men low in altruism. It\\'s hard to say whether these study findings apply to real-life interactions. But they do suggest that, if you\\'re a man looking for a committed relationship with a woman, you shouldn\\'t hesitate to flaunt the fact that you\\'re an unpaid mentor for elementary-school kids or that you help your elderly neighbor buy groceries every week. It could be an easy way to gain an edge over the more self-oriented guys out there.', 'text_b': None, 'label': True},\n",

See how she turned a nightmare into an incredible learning experience below! Hannah Combs was talking outside of school with friends one day when a bully came up from behind her and poured super glue on her hair. Although she had been bullied before, Hannah had just begun her freshman year of high school. The fresh start soon became her worse nightmare. \"It instantly started burning,\" Hannah said. \"It felt like my head was on fire. It was horrible.\" She suffered first degree burns and described the feeling as a \"sun burn times 10.\" Her father, a retired soldier, Christopher Grimmer was furious with the lack of action taken by staff. He says he was reprimanded by the assistant principal. Although Hannah was taken to the nurse’s office, it was only when Christian took her to urgent care that she was diagnosed with first degree burns. The pain lasted for days. Hannah and her mother Jessica made the decision that she would cut her hair. It was devastating. \"I realized I lost my favorite thing about me. I loved my hair,\" Hannah said. \"My hair was the only thing I liked about myself, honestly. I lost it for no reason.\" However, when Jessica started a Facebook page for her daughter \"Justice For Hannah,\" the support came pouring in. \"It makes me want to help other people,\" Hannah said. \"There are people who couldn’t stand up for themselves but they talk to me about it. It makes me want to help. It’s amazing how many people are supporting me.\" A local hair stylist named Nikki decided to clean up Hannah’s hair for free. \"Today I got to do something I’m proud of.

Hannah is embracing her new look and wants to use her new platform to help others. \"I want to make a difference. I would like people to stand up for themselves.

The conservative pundit blasted House Republicans as \"sell outs\" in a column on Wednesday for crafting guidelines on immigration that would create a mechanism to grant legal status to undocumented immigrants, saying that the growing Latino population will \"wreck the country.\" \"Leave aside the harm cheap labor being dumped on the country does to the millions of unemployed Americans,\" Coulter writes. \"What does it mean for the Republican Party?\" Casting aside conventional wisdom, Coulter says that embracing immigration reform would make the Republican Party lose voters. She argues that Latinos and other immigrant groups, particularly Asians, are so liberal on issues including Obamacare, gun control and the role of government that they’ll never vote in large numbers for Republicans. Coulter refuses to acknowledge public opinion on the immigration issue, writing: \"The only ones opposed to our current immigration policies are the people.\" In fact, polls routinely show that a majority of Americans support immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented -- a more liberal stance than the one released this week by House Republicans, which would only create a pathway to legal residence. To back her assertions, Coulter cites a study by Phyllis Schlafly, a fellow conservative pundit who has called on the Republicans to keep their party as white as possible. Coulter violated the embargo on the study, writing that it was \"too important to wait.\" The study was not provided in the column, so it’s not clear what new information it contained. Coulter writes that the study brings together several different previously released surveys by Pew, Gallup, Latino Decisions, and other pollsters showing that immigrants and Latinos tend to lean more liberal than the average U.S. citizen. \"The people that Republicans ought to reach out to are white voters,\" Schlaflly said last year during an appearance on conservative radio show Focus Today. \"There is not any evidence at all that these Hispanics coming in from Mexico will vote Republican. Actually, there is. Former President George W. Bush pulled 44 percent of the Latino vote in 2004. Avoiding the approach advocated by folks like Coulter or Schlafly, he spoke some Spanish, supported immigration reform and refrained from ranting against Latinos during interviews with the media. Many observers have concluded that the Republican Party would perform better among Latinos if it moderated the intransigent stance on immigration adopted by hardliners like Coulter. Instead, Coulter has argued since Barack Obama’s reelection as president in November that Republicans should ignore the country’s largest ethnic minority altogether.', 'text_b': None, 'label': True},\n",

Got something on your mind? Email the Funbag. Today, we’re covering egg whites, sex, cats that do dishes, and more. I took my family on a short road trip for spring break, and on the way home, my 2-year-old asked me to pull over so he could go take a crap. So I did. I pulled into the gas station, and then my wife brought the kid to the bathroom, and he announced that he was bluffing. He did NOT have to take a shit. So he got back in the car, and we drove for another 30 minutes, and then he announced, for a second time, that he had to go poop. \"You’re not lying this time, are you?\" I asked him. \"If you’re lying, I’ll never stop for you to poop again.\" But he said he had really had to go, so I pull over, and it’s the same thing. He was either lying or he got stage fright in the McDonald’s can. So my wife puts him back in the car, and we get stuck in traffic on the Beltway just as we’re getting home. I think you know where this is going. Once again, the boy screamed out that he had to poop. I told him he could hold it until we got home. Then he started clutching at his tummy and crying out to pull over. \"I don’t think he’s lying this time,\" my wife said. But I swear to you, we were just a mile from home at that point. And the Beltway is one of those horrible roads that offers very little in the way of ideal places to pull over. Home was the only logical destination for him to go void his bowels. So I told him he had to hold on jussssst a minute longer. Begged him, really. Sponsored On the exit ramp, he suddenly stopped crying. And I knew why. I could hear him exhaling forcefully. Kids don’t hide that sort of thing. We pulled into the driveway (not before hitting every light on the way there), and my wife rushed the boy into the house and into the bathroom. Green shit was CAKED on his legs. It was everywhere. Some of it fell out of his pants (how?) and landed on the front stoop. It was terrifying. Anyway, that’s parenting in a nutshell for you. You take every precaution possible, and you still end up with green shit all over the place. Now, your letters: Dan: I don’t know if this is a good question, because I doubt there’s any kind of satisfying answer to it. But why do no NFL teams seem to care that Jameis Winston maybe raped a girl? The mock drafts all have him going at no. 1 or 2 (most say no. 1). How the fuck?! Especially in light of the year the NFL has just had (and Goodell’s publicity push for an end to violence towards women), would it be that crazy to suggest that NFL teams won’t want to risk spending their first-round pick on someone who many people believe has a capacity for actual evil? Even if he never raped anyone, he has shown he’s a liability, at best, with the crab-legs thing and the \"fuck her right in the pussy\" thing. How are Bucky Brooks and Daniel Jeremiah not even hedging their bets at this stage? I’m sure last year they talked ad fucking nauseum about Johnny Manziel’s partying and how that would affect his draft stock. HOW DOES RAPE NOT??? Why aren’t they even mentioning it? I think you’re wildly overgeneralizing to say teams don’t care. Of course they care. You’d care if you were the GM who decided to risk his job by investing the no. 1 pick in a seafood thief and alleged rapist. But the Bucs desperately need a QB (or else everyone gets fired anyway), so they’re probably best off drafting Winston and then throwing out a bunch of some bullshit spiel to Peter King about how they had private eyes talk to over 75 people about Winston in studying him for the draft. That strikes me as an obvious ass-covering move so they can draft Winston, and then, if he fucks up, they can be like, \"Don’t blame us! We talked to 75 whole people about him!\" They just want to make sure he doesn’t commit any FUTURE rapes. And if he does, they want to make sure that they can blame Winston and Winston alone for it. But it is strange that, in the public scouting process, Winston’s past has been reduced to a handful of convenient euphemisms like \"immaturity\" and shit like that. Look at Lovie Smith gush about Winston, even though he can’t possibly know him all that well: \"To me, I think he’s told us an awful lot with how he’s handled it,\" Smith said. \"It’s not like he’s getting ready to go into the NFL and scrutiny is coming his way. He’s gone through it a couple years now, and he’s answered the bell. That’s what you have to do. You have to have tunnel vision and do your job. Looking from the outside, that’s what he’s been able to do.\" I mean, that’s a hell of a way to twist a rape allegation into a positive. LOOK AT HIM SHAKE OFF DEFENDERS AND CIRCUIT COURT JUDGES WITH SUCH EASE! The fact that Winston was never formally charged with rape, and the fact that the NFL and their broadcast partners probably have a great many lawyers who would prefer that the word RAPE not be thrown around when addressing Winston, is all Smith needs to sell you on the IDEA of drafting him ... to concoct a narrative of an ambitious young man looking to redeem himself as a way of cleverly masking the fact that the Bucs have an urgent, raw football need to fill, and they have little choice but to fill it with a guy who might be the scum of the fucking Earth. That’s why Winston’s rape allegations haven’t necessarily affected his draft stock the way Johnny Manziel’s drinking did. It’s because NFL teams think that Winston is simply a better player. If neither player had baggage going into the draft, Winston would be taken before Manziel every time. That’s the reason the Browns are ready to give up on Manziel already. It’s not the boozing. It’s the fact that they don’t think the little fucker can play. The NFL can chirp all they like about domestic violence and doing the right thing, but the bottom line is that the majority of their employees must win in order to keep their jobs, and that means they must place a bloodless premium on talent than the NFL would rather not acknowledge as still existing. They constantly want to sell you on character or on potential character instead. If Jameis is gonna go no. 1 no matter what, the NFL has no choice but to hold their noses and make it look like they didn’t willingly crown a psychopath prince of the draft. You know what’s funny about all this? Winston was AWFUL last season, and I’m not talking about just his \"Yakety Sax\" play in the Rose Bowl. He threw 18 picks last season against horrible, piddly-shit ACC teams. But scouts, for some reason, seem to be far more impressed by the fact that Winston staged a number of winning comebacks that were necessitated almost exclusively because of his own boneheaded mistakes. If you look the part, and you’ve got the arm, and you have that subjective mix of football IQ and magical QB unicorn leadership skills, scouts will happily overlook all those turnovers. And the rape stuff. It’s quite something. (By the way, SUPERFUCK Jaws and Mike Mayock for their little \"Mariota’s on top of my board now!\" spiel this week. Jaws is an empty-headed attention whore who will say basically anything. And the only reason certain football fans enjoy Mayock is because they haven’t learned to be sick of him yet.) Kyle: Are BIG EGG and BIG NUTRITION teaming up to push the egg white agenda? You have to have roughly double the egg whites to get the same amount of food, thus causing an increase in egg consumption. I’m suspicious of the whole thing. But the yolk has all the cholesterol! If you simply throw out the yolk, and then add bacon, ham, and cheese to your omelet, it can’t hurt you at all! That’s science. I used to be huge on egg whites. True story: In college, I would go to the dining hall, toast a bagel, grab a couple of hard-boiled eggs, remove the yolks, and then mush the whites onto the bagel and eat a sad egg-white bagel sandwich that way. I thought this was a healthy lunch, conveniently ignoring the whole \"eating a whole bagel\" part of the enterprise. Sometimes I ate two in one sitting. Do not do this. The truth is that egg whites are one of those foods you eat so that you can eat more food. I hate small portions, so if I eat a 12-pound egg-white omelet, I feel like I just got away with something. But in general, this is untrue. You need portion control in your life, which means you should just splurge and eat the goddamn yolk anyway. The yolk is the best part. All golden and runny and seeping into the toast nooks ... I could a 50-egg omelet. I swear. There are never enough eggs in the omelet for me. Why are eggs so small? I need eggs to be triple their current size. I don’t like cracking so many of them. I am not a crackpot.

Also, assume that anyone who you appointed would drop whatever else it was they were doing and accept their next eight years living in the White House. Well, look, it’s not like politicians are somehow uniquely skilled anyway. Pretty much anyone can be a politician if some shadowy party operative hands them a bag of cash and is like, \"Bill Kristol says you have nice teeth.\" That’s truly all you need to become a prominent politician in America at the present moment.

A good president needs to believe his own horseshit, and Musk and/or Tim Cook would more than fulfill that requirement.

Brian: Me and my girlfriend have debated this for a while, and we are both dead set in believing the other is 100 percent wrong: What’s the better time of year for sex, summer or winter? She says that summer is better because the heat makes it feel that much more steamy, summer bodies are great, and you can get fully nude without having to keep any layers on because of the cold. I say fuck that. September is the most common birth month in the United States, which means that we Americans seem to prefer fucking in the winter, if only because there’s nothing else to do.

I want everything out in the open. I want to be hot and sweaty and horny and dying to rip off my sexy striped polo shirt just for YOU, baby.

The Beatles one, because the Beatles would just take the NWA lyrics and arrange some entirely new Beatles song around them, and it would probably be very pretty.

The masses never tire of pop music, so why not put out an album a month? Because that’s too much product! Even the nuttiest white-girl Beyoncé fans would get sick of her if she put out 120 songs a year. You can’t keep up with that kind of catalog. Those songs can’t all be great. Even if they were, you’d still grade them on a curve and have certain \"hits\" in your mind that would make your permanent rotation, with everything else falling by the wayside. That’s easy to do now. Back in day, when I had to listen to tapes, I usually listened to all the songs on the album because I was too lazy to fast forward. I heard \"Back Off Bitch\" by GNR far more times than anyone should have to endure. Not their best work. I don’t have to do that anymore. Technology has made me a supremely lazy music fan. It’s just not possible to absorb that much music from one artist, no matter how hard you try. Ever have your favorite artist put out a double album? It’s a complete pain in the ass. I need you to go away for a while so that I can grow to love you again. Whenever an artist says that they had 60 tracks to choose from or whatever for a single album, I can promise you that you NEVER want to hear the 50 tracks they threw away. Half of those tracks are just the guy freestyling on the bongos while high on acid. Kevin: So I’m getting married in a month, and my fiancé and I are closing on a house next week. Instead of some over-the-top bachelor party, I am asking that my friends just help me move. My friends feel that this is selfish, and I’m taking advantage of them. We’re moving from a 1,000-square-foot apartment into a three-bedroom house. It’s not like we have a ton of stuff. The plan was that I rent the truck, and we move everything Saturday morning, and then grill steaks and get drunk Saturday night in the new house. I think that this is way better than asking everyone to kick in hundreds of dollars to go golfing for a weekend or whatever; it’s my bachelor party, and I should be able to do what I want, right? But that’s not a party. You’re asking for free manual labor instead. That doesn’t count as a celebration, you monster. If I threw a party, and everyone came, and then I was like, \"Hey guys, this is a LAUNDRY FOLDING party! Now fold my laundry and I’ll get takeout!\" all my friends would have me killed. You can’t do that. If you want to ask your friends to help you move, that’s fine. But you can’t apply that to your party credit. Do the move yourself, and then have the bachelor-party cookout afterward, without putting any work obligations on your friends. Steve: This actually happened close to six years ago, but it remains a contentious issue amongst our group of friends. Five of us were on a road trip from Montreal to Boston, rotating drivers evenly as one does on longish road trips. As we got close to Boston, the friend driving the last leg got pulled over for speeding. Since we were in college at the time, the $200+ ticket was nothing to sneeze at. (Who are we kidding? It’s still a lot of damn money.) The issue was — does the ticket get split amongst the group, or paid solely by the driver? The four of us who drove first say no, since we drove our portion without incident. The friend who got slapped with the bill argues that since the last leg was the toughest, and we were trying to get to our destination by a certain time, and nobody complained about his speed until the blue and whites started flashing, that we should split the ticket. Who is right? The last leg was the toughest? Why? Were there dragons lining the highway? Your friend was driving, and thus he’s responsible for his own driving behavior, even if he had shit luck. He pays the ticket. If another friend riding in the car wants to pitch in, fine. But that guy shouldn’t EXPECT it. These kids today never want to take responsibility SMDH! I went to a basketball game last week, and I had an Uber take me home, only the Uber guy got a parking ticket outside the arena while he was waiting for me. And I felt bad that he got the ticket, so when the ride ended, I gave him $20 in cash extra. And that, of course, made me feel all generous and kind. YES AMERICA, I helped pay a full one-tenth of that poor bastard’s ticket while exploiting regulation loopholes that force working-class people to act as private chauffeurs to uppity white dipshits with smartphones. MEDAL OF HONOR FOR ME, PLEEEEEEEZ. But screw your friend. Tom: Where would the most opportune time/place for aliens to land to get the biggest initial audience, but not get shot out of the sky? The White House lawn would be a great spot, but they would have several fighter jets shooting at them before they land; a random field would have no one around. I feel the best bet is a major sporting event that doesn’t have dedicated aerial security. What do you think? All major sporting events have (in theory) patrolled airspace. I would just vote for the Sheep Meadow in Central Park, dead center of Manhattan. News crews could get there quickly. Crowds would form. Roasted-nut vendors would make a KILLING. And New Yorkers would instantly try to take ownership of the First Contact experience. \"You guys don’t get these aliens. IT’S A NEW YORK THING.\" Actually, now that I think about it, let’s choose any large park space in any other city. Because Central Park is a complete fucking pain in the ass. It’s hot and overcrowded, and there’s horseshit everywhere. If aliens landed there, four million people would converge on the spot, and then I wouldn’t be able to get a good view, and the subways would be jammed, and I would just say FUCK IT and then go home and watch the aliens on TV instead. Mike: How does Robocop poop? He has that weird baby food he has to eat to keep his organic parts alive, so he must have to release it somehow. Actually, if you look at the original uniform design, the posterior covering is soft and potentially removable. It’s not welded metal. Robocop could, in theory, remove a posterior assflap to do his business, even if no standard toilet could possibly bear the weight of a three-ton cyborg sitting down to shit in it. My guess is that instead of straight defecation, Robocop has an internal waste-management system that processes his urine and stool, and then either a) recycles it for some other practical use (poop gun), or b) can be discreetly disposed of, like through a leg dispenser. That’s what I would do if I were designing the perfect 21st-century scumbag-killing machine. RoboCop has no time for poop. Aaron: What happened if it came out that President Obama had a Twitter account under a different name and was trolling conservatives and his critics completely anonymously? I’m not saying one of his staffers was doing this—this was how Barry O passed the time while on the shitter. Would there be calls for impeachment/resignation? How long would the media blow that up for? What would his Twitter handle be? Would he put a picture and bio, or just keep the egg there like a weirdo? There are calls for Obama’s impeachment and resignation on a daily basis right now, so I assume a @Luther account would only amplify those daily complaints. \"More like Marco Boob-io, AMIRITE?!\" That tweet would probably help fill up a news cycle or two before everyone stopped giving a shit. I don’t think he’d actually resign, though. After all, plenty of politicians out there already use Twitter for trolling purposes. And we live in age where you can survive pretty much any scandal so long as you’re willing to sit there and ride it out. You let 200 million people take a dump on your face for a week, nod politely, and then everything is back to normal. I do think he’d have a picture and bio for his troll account, tho. The Obama machine knows too much about the internet to let that slide. Email of the week! Ape Chemist: Suppose during the first round of the NFL draft, the camera cuts to a player talking on his cell phone and smiling and celebrating with his family and friends. This all takes place while the team is on the clock, so Goodell has yet to announce the pick. While celebrating, the player—like Lamarr Houston or Bill Gramatica—tears his ACL. Assume the team hasn’t officially announced the pick. Does the NFL let the team withdraw the pick? I remember when the Vikings had to pass on a pick because they didn’t get their card in on time, so I could absolutely see some team arguing the pick wasn’t official until the card is turned in and read. I hope this happens to some team like the Cowboys, and Jerry sends someone onstage to tackle Goodell before he reaches the podium. I might be wrong, but I think once you turn the card in, the pick is final. No backsies, even if it hasn’t been formally announced. If you haven’t turned the card in but GLORY BOY decided to tear his knee up anyway, then fuck him. Switch it and draft Todd Gurley instead. But once the Ginger Hammer has that card, you cannot bend his IRON WILL. Drew Magary writes for Deadspin. He’s also a correspondent for GQ.

Here's the AnswerSmartphones design has evolved a lot in recent times with several manufacturers such as Apple, Motorola, Google, HTC, Sony taking the initiatives in manufacturing a good looking smartphone. The trend these days have been the unibody metal design which is becoming the next plastic thing for the smartphones. There are a lot of smartphones ranging from flagship to entry-level segment to come with the metal body. We are speaking about only the metal bodied smartphones. But why? Because the metal body smartphones usually have stripes on their back. We don't say all of them have the stripes over the back, but most of the smartphones have that and the other metal body smartphone have this stripes along their sides. You might be wondering on what does these stripes indicate, right? Well, look after the sliders below to know more the white lines. What Actually Are Those White Lines? The answer to this question is a simple one. The White Lines on all metal bodied smartphones are 'Antenna Bands'. Antenna Bands are the things usually the antenna in radios or other electronic devices which convert the electric power signals to radio signals and vice versa. This is bit technical. In simple words, the antenna bands are used to receive and transmit signals. Who Started This? Previously, there used to some other design policy where the antenna bands are not visible, however, it is worth noticing that the old age smartphones didn't use metal to build on. Instead, there are iPhones with glass on front and back. Now, this White lines trend was started by Apple with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Soon, it was followed by other manufacturers. It is worth noticing that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were heavily criticised for their design language. Are they harmful? Absolutely, No. They are just antenna bands to send and receive signals. According to us, manufacturers designed in that manner to make the smartphone look better. Followed by? Apple always leads from the front in innovating and they are the same with this. Following the footprints of Apple, there are many manufacturers such as OnePlus, HTC, Meizu, etc who added the same design language to their smartphones. However, some of them look really good such as the OnePlus 3, Meizu MX6. Asus Manufactured the Invisible Band Smartphone Asus is the first manufacturer who launched a metal smartphone with invisible bands. The ZenFone 3 Series are the first smartphones in the world to launch with invisible bands even with the metal body.\", 'text_b': None, 'label': True},\n",

The two Northerners battled in the courtyard of Winterfell, after the largest and most brutal battle in Thrones history, and Jon ended up beating the bastard into a bloody pulp. It was a wonderfully cathartic moment to see the usually cocky and sneering Ramsay get his just desserts but it was anything but wonderful for poor Iwan Rheon.

He was really nice about it. I had to buy him a pint after that one. Thankfully Iwan doesn’t share his characters love of skinning men alive and laughed off the accident joking: \"Jaw hurt a bit the next day, but, you know, it’s understandable.\" Harington also revealed that he thinks Jon goes a bit too far while beating Ramsay’s face into a fine paste.

The device is already being delivered, free, to one million Year 7 children in schools across the UK. Now it will also be available to buy from the various partners in the project for £12.99. Commercial availability of the Micro Bit follows the signing of a licensing deal with the device\\'s manufacturer, the Leeds-based company, element 14. The firm says it will only sell them in batches of 90. But retailers including Microsoft, the Technology Will Save Us organisation and Sciencescope will offer individual devices. Image caption Owners of the Micro Bit can write code for it via a website designed by Microsoft Element 14 is part of Premier Farnell, one of the distributors of the very successful Raspberry Pi barebones computer. Richard Curtin, strategic alliance director at element 14, is expecting a similar reception for the Micro Bit. \"It\\'s going to be huge,\" he told me.\"We\\'ve already got a pipeline of orders including foreign governments who\\'ve seen what has happened in the UK.\" The Micro Bit was meant to be the flagship of the BBC\\'s Make It Digital season last year but suffered a number of delays. It started arriving in schools this spring and the BBC says it has now been delivered to about 80% of schools and roughly 750,000 Year 7 children (11 and 12-year olds). While I have heard plenty of enthusiasm from those children who have got their hands on it - and there are already plenty of exciting projects on display - there have also been frustrations from teachers. Media caption Rishworth School sent a Micro Bit into the stratosphere A number have told me that the Micro Bit has arrived far too late in the school year to be of much use - \"starting after half term, it\\'s come far too late to get proper use out of it, plus concerns about handling/failures\" was one comment this morning. But another teacher said this: \"Got ours just before Easter hols. Kids are loving using them and are even buying add-ons for them, building projects at home etc.\" It is late in the year - although the Micro Bits belong to the children who will take them home over the summer holidays. Image caption Until now, only Year 7 schoolchildren in the UK had access to their own Micro Bits The hope must be that their enthusiasm will continue as they join Year 8 in September, though of course there is a risk that their devices will be lost or broken by then. The real test, however, will be whether schools and parents decide that the next Year 7 children will benefit from getting their own Micro Bits. They could decide it is worthwhile investing in the devices now they are going to be available to buy. And there is also the prospect of some being made available for free again. Element 14 tells me it is paying a licensing fee for the use of the BBC and Micro Bit brands - but that all of that money will be going to a charitable trust with the aim of providing an educational legacy. The Micro Bit is entering what is now quite a crowded market for simple educational computing devices. But if it does prove as good a seller as the Raspberry Pi, then a windfall for the charity could mean more Year 7 children getting their hands on one.', 'text_b': None, 'label': True},\n",

Resistance to antibiotics is growing at such an alarming rate that they risk losing effectiveness entirely meaning medical procedures such as caesarean sections, joint replacements and chemotherapy could soon become too dangerous to perform. Unless urgent action is taken, drug resistant infections will kill 10 million people a year by 2050, more than cancer kills currently, the report’s authors warn. Drug resistant infections are thought to be growing due to over-use of medicine such as antibiotics and anti-fungus treatments to treat minor conditions such as the common cold. With over-use, resistance to the drugs builds up meaning some conditions become incurable and so-called ‘superbugs’ such as MRSA develop. Research has also suggested that antibiotic use in pig farming is common as poor living conditions mean such treatment is necessary to prevent infections spreading between livestock and that this passes down to humans through pork consumption, increasing resistance levels further. In the UK, 45 per cent of all antibiotics are given to livestock. Antibiotic-resistant infections spread through Europe 4 show all Antibiotic-resistant infections spread through Europe 1/4 K. pneumoniaeis one of the toughest super-infections Alamy 2/4 Amoxicillin, the commonest antibiotic prescribed by GPs 3/4 Antibiotic resistance cycle 4/4 Antibiotic-resistant infections in Europe The report is the result of a two year long review of the use of antibiotics undertaken by economist and former Goldman Sachs Asset Managemet chairman Lord Jim O’Neill. The review was commissioned by the Government amid growing concerns about the use of the medicines in the UK. Lord O\\'Neill said tackling antimicrobial resistance is \\'absolutely essential\\' (PA) It calls for urgent action to halt the growing use of antibiotics: \"to avoid the terrible human and economic costs of resistance that the world would otherwise face.\" Among his recommendations, Lord O’Neill calls for a public awareness campaign on the harms of antibiotic use, for restrictions to be placed on the use of some critical antibiotics and a tax on the drugs to be introduced for livestock use. The report estimates that without action now, the cost of the antibiotic failure will be $100 trillion between before 2050. Antibiotics crisis is global Lord O’Neill said of the findings: \"My review not only makes it clear how big a threat antimicrobial resistance is to the world, with a potential 10 million people dying each year by 2050, but also now sets out a workable blueprint for bold, global action to tackle this challenge. The actions I’m setting out today are ambitious in their scope- but this is a problem which it is well within our grasp to solve if we take action now... to avoid the terrible human and economic costs of resistance that the world will otherwise face.\" Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne welcomed the report’s recommendations, saying: \"Lord O’Neill’s review provides a stark warning that unless we take global action, antimicrobial resistance will become a greater threat to mankind than cancer currently is. It is not just a threat to health but also to the world economy. Apart from the moral case for action, the economic cost of failing to act is too great to contemplate.\" Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England, who previously warned that the UK is facing an \"apocalyptic scenario\" over antimicrobial drug use also welcomed the report, describing the recommendations as \"challenging.\" Antibiotics act to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria, stopping infections. They transformed medicine when they were first used early last century and have contributed to the near eradication of a number of serious conditions including tuberculosis and syphilis. An estimated 40 million antibiotics are prescribed in the UK every year, of which the health regulator Nice claims 10 million are unnecessary prescriptions.', 'text_b': None, 'label': False},\n",

The cardboard costumed Rubio-bots mechanically handing out broken gaskets were not New Hampshire voters. At least 50 percent of the 800 or so attendees were not New Hampshire voters. There were no pancakes at the pancake breakfast. So went Marco Rubio\\'s morning after, the morning after an Ambien-esque nightmare of a debate performance where Chris Christie repeatedly pounced on him for reciting the same anti-Obama talking point, nearly word for word, four times. \"There it is!\" gleeful scorekeeper Christie called on ball three, \"The memorized 25-second speech!\" Londonderry High School was greeted first by two cardboard and tinfoil robots, who mechanically droned Rubio\\'s now-defining line, \"Let\\'s dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn\\'t know what he\\'s doing. He knows exactly what he\\'s doing,\" over and over. Although the beleaguered Rubio campaign was quick to call it another Bush dirty trick, the Marco Robotos were animated by operatives from Democratic Super PAC American Bridge. Kevin McAllister, the PAC\\'s deputy communications director-turned-costumed robot, said the campaign\\'s only inspiration was provided by Christie, and the opportunity was irresistible. Rubio strategists downplayed the attention their candidate\\'s debate performance was getting. \"I think it\\'s a narrow band of folks who read each other on Twitter,\" Jim Merrill, a Rubio senior advisor for New Hampshire, said, dismissing the entire affair. \"We\\'re going to focus on President Obama.\" Any slip of the gears isn\\'t going to affect Tuesday\\'s results. \"We have a very strong ground game.\" Merrill was also unconcerned by the fact that a morning pancake breakfast appeared to be transforming into a mid-morning rally. \"I don\\'t know where they got the idea to come at 8:30. Nobody said that,\" he said. \"People just got here early,\" he explained, pointing out that the campaign was offering free muffins, berries, and juice. Not everyone—especially the hundreds who\\'d received the campaign\\'s invitation for an 8:30 pancake breakfast—was satisfied. \"It\\'s the Marco Rubio pancake breakfast—so far we\\'ve had no pancakes and no Marco Rubio,\" joked Bob Durant, a Rhode Island lawyer who was political touring with his family and friends. \"You wonder is it really because you have so many people,\" that things are delayed, Bob asked, or is it because, after the debate, \"He has to re-write his entire speech, since Chris Christie ripped it up?\" His wife, Meg, was watching it all with more of an insider\\'s eye. The Michigan state director for the Bush/Quayle 1992 campaign, Meg Durant looks for the little things to tell her how a campaign is doing. After Saturday\\'s Republican debate, she grabbed a couple of Christie and Bush signs for her kids. Some Christie volunteers followed her all the way back to her car. \"They waited for me to drive away,\" to make sure she didn\\'t replace one of their Christie signs with a Bush sign. \"Christie\\'s people, they are street fighters.\" Still, she admitted, it\\'s been difficult to predict how things are going. \"I thought Jeb had it. I thought he was a shoo-in,\" when the race first got underway. After Bush began to founder, \"I thought Marco would have walked away with it. But after last night...\" she gave a little shrug. \"I hope this morning is the Marco we want to see.\" Durant was also finding it difficult to figure how event turnout, especially with the rising interest in political tourism, translates into votes. \"There are ten of us here,\" she noted, \"and only one of us is a New Hampshire voter.\" That would be her cousin, Tom Stevens, a retired lawyer who moved from Ohio to New Hampshire two years ago. He\\'s still undecided; his wife was for Hillary Clinton until she went to a Clinton rally last week. Now, she\\'s undecided, too. When Rubio finally showed up a little after ten, he was as flat as, well, a pancake. \"A couple of housekeeping items,\" were the first words out of his mouth. \"We couldn\\'t figure out how to make pancakes for 800 people—I hope they fed you.\" It didn\\'t get better. He\\'s still going to abolish the federal Department of Education, but he\\'s decided to offer Tom Brady \"a cabinet position. Belichick, too.\" And then, because at best he can only really modify and not stop himself, \"Well, I\\'m going to say it again.... Barack Obama is the first president, at least in my lifetime, that wants to change the country. ... Not fix its problems; he wants to make it a different kind of country.\" Things perked up a little bit when Rubio agreed to answer a few questions, calling on innocuous-looking white haired fellow in a bright flannel shirt. Identifying himself as Capt. Dan, a 65-year-old retired charter boat operator and a Rubio constituent from Florida, he wondered what a President Rubio would do about the climate change flooding that\\'s putting his house in Miami Beach underwater. \"I\\'m going to get my money out of it and move to higher ground,\" Capt. Dan explained, who added that he doesn\\'t expect to live forever. Isn\\'t there something Rubio can do about climate change \"for the young people?\" Rubio has a script for this question. Climate change legislation hurts the economy. It hurts the economy and has no real impact on the environment. The better approach is to support innovators of American energy. \"I say, \\'OK, if we pass this bill how many feet of sea rise will it prevent?\\'\" he explained, reasonably, as he has on this and many other occasions. \"\\'Well, it won\\'t prevent any sea rise.\\' OK, well how many degrees of temperature will it avoid going up?\\' Well, it won\\'t do that either.\" But afterwards, Capt. Dan professed to be happy with Rubio\\'s response. \"Last time I heard him say it,\" which just happened to be in Manchester two days ago, \"he said it was too expensive, too difficult, wait.\" This time \"he started to look to the side a little bit, see a different way to see it.\" Possibly so. Reframing climate change as a family issue, not an environmental one, could certainly cause Rubio some cognitive dissonance. Very possibly that could be the conscious intent of folksy Capt. Dan, who traveled all the way to New Hampshire because \"this is such an intimate state where I have access to all the candidates....where I can ask the questions I want to ask.\" Folksy Capt. Dan Kipnis, who traveled all the way to New Hampshire on the dime of a climate change organization. Capt. Dan Kipnis, member of the Miami-Dade County Climate Change Advisory Task Force. Capt. Dan Kipnis, Director-at-Large, Florida Wildlife Federation. Capt. Dan Kipnis, adviser to former vice president Al Gore. Capt. Dan Kipnis, who has been trying to bring Marco Rubio to the climate change table for nearly 10 years now. As the pancake-less attendees exited the school cafeteria, Merrill\\'s \"very strong ground game\" was in action. Two young Rubio volunteers tried to nail down the vote, asking attendees to sign an \"I Pledge to Vote for Rubio\" The responses: I\\'m not from here. No, New York. I\\'m from out of state. We\\'re from Connecticut. We just came up from Massachusetts. \"Thank you for making the drive,\" one volunteer repeatedly responded. It grew a little wearying. \"Nobody is,\" he started, and then corrected himself, \"There are a few people from New Hampshire.\" Watching from a ledge behind him was Kaity Thomson, a recent University of New Hampshire graduate, who\\'d come to hear Rubio with her co-worker and friend Yuxi Wang. \"We were expecting pancakes,\" said Thomson, who is now working for 350.org, the international environmental citizens pressure group. \"It\\'s crazy.\" Thomson, still undecided, did come away with something she could believe in, though: \"The visiting captain\\'s story ...

People were confused when Bob Arum, promoter of Top Rank, announced that another fight was scheduled for the Filipino boxer. Eyebrows were raised because Pacquiao had already declared his dedication for public service even prior to his win during the national elections. So what was the truth? The 37-year old boxer unretired for another fight. Manny Pacquiao announced his retirement, which lasted for 3 months, after his unanimous win against Timothy Bradley. Pacquiao did not deny his eagerness to come back to his career of 21 years which made him a household name and a worldwide recognized boxer when he rose in eight divisions. After the game which gave Mahindra a 105-103 win against the defending champion of the Governors’ Cup, the San Miguel Beermen, he confessed to a horde of journalists his aspiration to add another win under his belt. According to him, boxing helped him provide for his family and he does not want to consider his job as a senator as his livelihood. With Las Vegas in mind as the venue, Arum set the date of his fight on November 5. Instead of the usual camp in Hollywood with Freddie Roach, the senator’s camp will be in the Philippines in order for him to still be able to fulfill his duties as a politician. Pacquiao was elected twice as the congressman of Sarangani before he ran for Senate. His 4 days of attendance in Congress became controversial. It was in May 2015 after his loss against Floyd Mayweather Jr. when news of his retirement floated around. These rumors were put to rest when his third fight with Timothy Bradley was announced. He won the fight against the latter in a unanimous decision. When asked again about his departure from boxing, Pacquiao left the door open for a potential comeback and true to his prediction, the pride of the Philippines will attempt to bring back glory once again to the country.

A paper published in thejournal puts forward the theory that a massive asteroid did indeed strike the Earth, but that its devastating effects were different than commonly thought, reports Researchers – from Japan’s Meteorological Research Institute and Tohuku Univeristy – now believe the asteroid struck the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, hitting massive oil deposits and sending a blanket of thick black smoke into the atmosphere, engulfing the planet. The amount of sunlight fell by a huge 85 per cent, causing the Earth to cool by as much as 16 degrees Celsius on land for about three years. Also, rainfall would have fallen by roughly 80 per cent causing extreme and devastating droughts. The researchers wrote: Small mammals and reptiles could have lived underground where it is warmer – dinosaurs did not. These different habitats would have been key factors in determining their extinction or survival. Wikimedia Experts had previously wondered why dinosaurs had died out while other reptiles – like the ancestors of crocodiles – had survived. The accepted theory was that the impact caused vapours of sulphuric acid in the sky, which reflected sunlight, leading to global darkness, near-freezing conditions and widespread acid rain. However, the team from Tohuku said: If this had occurred, crocodilians and various other animals would have also gone extinct.

              "  {'guid': 239, 'text_a': 'Where \"Kanye West\" is more popular than \"Jesus Christ\" - Is \\'Kanye West\\' More Popular Than \\'Jesus Christ\\'?Kanye West has used Jesus Christ in his art since \"Jesus Walks.\" Never, though, has West\\'s embrace of the Son of God been as fervent as his last album, \"Yeezus,\" which title is a portmanteau of West\\'s nickname (Yeezy) and Jesus. The album also features a direct Kanye-Jesus comparison in the song \"I Am A God\": \"I know he the most high / But I am a close high.\" With Kanye bringing a Jesus lookalike on stage during his current tour, The Huffington Post decided now is a good time to compare the relative places of Kanye and Jesus in the popular zeitgeist. To do this, we analyzed a year\\'s worth of Twitter data (from Oct. 21, 2012 to Oct. 20, 2013) via the third-party service Topsy. When comparing Jesus and Kanye on Twitter, the first question is what terms should we use for the comparison? There are a lot terms Twitter users use to reference Jesus: there\\'s the broad \"Jesus,\" which includes other people named Jesus, the more specific \"Jesus Christ\" and foreign language versions -- Jesucristo in Spanish, gesù cristo in Italian. Some users also tag the name, resulting in mentions for @Jesus. There are a lot fewer version of \"Kanye.\" \"Kanye,\" which includes other people named Kanye (though there are far less people named Kanye than Jesus), \"Kanye West\" and @kanyewest. (There are also nominal instances of people tweeting his nicknames, like Yeezy and \\'Ye.) Since Jesus doesn\\'t have a genuine Twitter account, and Kanye has a habit of deleting all of his tweets, using @ mentions didn\\'t seem that promising or fair. Looking to minimize instances of other people named Jesus and Kanye, we decided to start our search comparing \"Kanye West\" with \"Jesus Christ\": According to the data, in the last year worldwide, looking at only original Tweets (no retweets, no replies), \"Jesus Christ\" had 3,936,585 mentions, while \"Kanye West\" had 4,541,349 mentions. Pretty impressive for the 36-year-old rapper. While West\\'s total was greater overall, on a typical day, Kanye didn\\'t have more tweets than Jesus. Kanye\\'s numbers were skewed by a few high mention days and his median tweets/day (9,981) were, in fact, lower than Jesus\\'s median tweets/day (10,458). In fact, Jesus had more tweets on the majority of days (187 out of the 365 days in the year). So, using \"Kanye West\" vs \"Jesus Christ,\" their Twitter mentions are pretty close. But what about the foreign language tweets? Kanye has an advantage with foreign language tweets, because countries with the Latin derived alphabets, as far as we know, refer to Kanye West as Kanye West while, as mentioned above, there are many different ways to reference Jesus. Only looking at the United States offers a clearer picture. Although there are some residents in the U.S. who speak foreign languages, Jesus Christ is generally used as the identifier. Here, again using \"Kanye West\" vs \"Jesus Christ,\" Kanye had slightly more mentions overall, 2,429,931 to 2,224,895, but they were about equal when the day-to-day totals received consideration. Breaking it down state-by-state, some states tweeted more about Jesus (orange states) while other states tweeted more about Kanye (green states). When did users tweet the most about Jesus and Kanye? Kanye West\\'s top five days: 1) 8/26/2013, 90,993 tweets. The day after his \"Blood on the Leaves\" performance at the VMAs 2) 12/31/2012, 70,701 tweets. New Years Eve. Kim Kardashian announces she\\'s pregnant with West\\'s baby. 3) 9/27/2013, 58,608 tweets. West feuds with Kimmel on Twitter and gets in a confrontation with paparazzi. 4) 6/18/2013, 51,012 tweets. The official release of his album \"Yeezus.\" 5) 6/21/2013, 48192. The announcement of his baby\\'s name: North West. Jesus Christ\\'s top five days: 1) 12/25/2012, 37,459 tweets: Christmas. 2) 5/9/2013, 36,393 tweets: Ascension Thursday 3) 3/31/2013, 35,955 tweets: Easter Sunday 4) 3/29/2013, 29,576 tweets: Good Friday 5) 4/23/2013, 26,921 tweets: St. George\\'s Day Jesus Christ\\'s biggest day-of-the-week was Sunday, while Kanye\\'s biggest day-of-the-week was Monday. When you look at the stream of \"Jesus Christ\" tweets, you will quickly notice a complication: a large amount of the \"Jesus Christ\" tweets are idiomatic (\"I just stubbed my toe. Jesus Christ! #notblessed\") and don\\'t actually refer to the literal Jesus Christ. Usage of the exclamatory \"Jesus Christ\" is probably more popular among those who are at least exposed to Christianity, so it may still be a good signal for Jesus\\'s popularity among the Twitterati. That being said, the idiomatic Jesus Christ doesn\\'t directly refer to the person Jesus Christ, while Kanye West refers to the person Kanye in almost all cases, so if we\\'re looking for an apples-to-apples comparison, then Jesus Christ\\'s numbers are significantly smaller. How much smaller? We looked at a sample of the hundred most recent tweets for \"Jesus Christ\" on Twitter using the Twitter search and found that 73 percent of uses of \"Jesus Christ\" were idiomatic, leaving 27 percent literal. This search occurred during a tense soccer match (lots of \"Jesus Christ\" exclamations) and is too small of a sample to offer definitive conclusions, but it signals that the idiomatic \"Jesus Christ\" is accounting for a significant portion of the examined mentions. So what happens if you compare \"Jesus\" vs \"Kanye\"? Jesus had significantly more tweets: Kanye had 10,412,097 tweets compared to Jesus\\'s 51,724,902 tweets. Looking again at a sample of the hundred latest tweets to gauge what\\'s going on, we see the following breakdown: Idiomatic: 22% Literal: 70% Other Person\\'s Name: 8% This sample is again too small to prove definitive, but even if only 25 percent of those tweets that contain the word Jesus refer to the religious figure, \"Jesus\" would still have more literal tweets than \"Kanye,\" and the proportion of tweets referring to Jesus appears to be much higher than that. We also haven\\'t accounted for different names for Jesus in languages other than English. When you break it down by region, mentions of \"Jesus\" are more popular than \"Kanye\" pretty much everywhere. So, it looks like Jesus is \"the most high\" on Twitter -- except for Justin Bieber, who trumps Jesus in popularity with 68,257,710 tweets for the search term \"Bieber\" during the same period.', 'text_b': None, 'label': True},\n",

One man had some empty space in his attic, so he decided to fix it up into the man cave of his dreams. Instead of just making it into private space, he decided to put a twist on the room revamp. He converted it into a boat's cabin. As crazy as that sounds, it actually turned out awesome! This is the attic's original entrance. And this is what it used to look like. He modified the angle of the roof with some beams. Don't try this at home yourself. Manipulating pre-engineered structural beams like this could be very dangerous. This was a touchy process, as he was changing the angle of the inside of the attic without compromising the structural integrity of the beams. Then, he needed to find a way to create a new entrance into the attic. The existing opening is in the middle of the hall, which wouldn't work out. So he chipped away at a wall that was adjacent to stairs that led down into the garage. He used this opening as the new entrance up into the attic. Olivier-FR even added a very fitting door with a nautical window. This is the door, which didn't lead to anything, at first. He planned on adding a roof window that would hopefully result in some extra light. More importantly, there would need to be stairs into the cool new attic. Here's the stair frame, soldered and painted black. Installed and ready to go! He enclosed the stairs in a small capsule. What it looked like from the outside. The new attic was covered with wood paneling and painted. Here's the skylight. Looking good, even without the full coat of paint. Here are the stairs from above. The view from the attic window. Olivier-FR got the whole family involved when it came time to build some furniture. After the whole place was painted, carpeting went down. The wood of the stairs was a dark exotic grain. He switched out the door for a sliding one to save space. Then, he added a railing as a safety precaution. Time to decorate! A television, sound system, and some cool wall hangings were all necessary. Plus, a fouton, weight bench, and some lounge space. To stabilize the temperature, lots of insulation was added. Plus, a heating/cooling unit. Most other attic rooms just pale in comparison to this awesomeness. This is basically a treehouse for adults...which is why it's so great!

First, it's a nice hedge against inflation because the companies in the index are presumably raising their prices with inflation; since companies are valued on a multiple of revenue or profit, this will be captured in the growth of the stock market. Secondly, and most importantly, is that it's hard to argue with its results. The compound annual growth rate for stocks on the S&P Index for the last 30 years has been 11%. There are very few if any opportunities available to us regular individual investors that can top that kind of return for the risk. (Note: you'll get an entirely different view from hedge funds or mutual funds. They believe they can beat market returns and so they charge high fees for their time and efforts. A few of them are worth it. Most of them are not). Kachroo-Levine: What are you planning on changing about your strategy in 2017? Livingston: As a retiree, steady cash flow is going to matter more to me than it has in the past. There are only two ways to make money: appreciation and income. Stocks, for example, are about appreciation you make very little money on a regular basis (usually a puny 1%-2% in dividends), but a year or two or three later, you can sell it for much more than you paid and pocket the difference. A heavily appreciation-based strategy, like going 100% into index funds, will no longer meet my needs. Income-based strategies, by contrast, put a steady paycheck in the spotlight. Bonds are generally purchased for the interest they provide. Sure they can appreciate or depreciate in value, but the bulk of your return from a bond comes from the monthly or quarterly dividend it pays. I have a few years to build myself an income-based strategy, as I still have some deferred compensation coming from my old employer, but I'm looking to add one or two rental properties to my portfolio in 2017. Interest rates are still fairly low so it's not a bad time to be a borrower. I would also look at adding more bonds to my portfolio (specifically leveraged municipal bond funds; the leverage juices returns and municipal bonds are tax exempt), but I do not want to buy bonds right now, as the Fed has signaled a plan to increase interest rates (and even raised them just a week ago). Kachroo-Levine: What are your financial/investment goals for 2017? What are your priorities? Livingston: As I am newly retired, my main priority is transitioning my portfolio into more income-based opportunities that can provide steady money to cover my expenses each year. I'm on the lookout for a rental property or two to take advantage of low interest rates and which will provide some much-needed steady income. In some parts of the country like San Francisco, rental properties are actually negative cash flow exercises and are predicated on appreciation. In some areas, it will throw off 6%-7% or more in income each year and fit my income needs. Real estate is hyperlocal like that. Kachroo-Levine: What are the key philosophies that help shape your investment strategy? Livingston: I feel I've gotten pretty far on just two things.First, don't be afraid to say you don't know. People get really weird and insecure when it comes to money. We're all lifelong learners. I have to admit I don't know basic things all the time. For example, while I've read quite a bit about real estate investment, I'm constantly finding myself with a giant question mark as I apply those concepts to my first live investments. My priority though is to make money and learn, not to impress people. Second: Don't give up until you really feel you understand something.  Finally, my other silver bullet question is to ask What are the arguments against it? or What are the three things that could break this strategy? There's no free lunch. Every strategy has some vulnerability. Kachroo-Levine: What advice can you offer for novice investors in 2017? Specifically, if you were speaking to people who had never invested beyond a 401(k) or IRA, what would you say to them? Livingston: You are in such an exciting place, because there is low-hanging fruit all around you. A few things: 1. Money management is an incremental game, not a winner-take-all game. That means every tweak you make has a noticeable impact on your money, and it means you don't have to choose between going whole hog or absolute zero. You can devote however much time and effort you have and get proportional results and new ideas to employ. 2. Momentum matters most. Start by joining a few interesting communities and blogs and read a little bit a few times a week. Cruise around on the Reddit Personal Finance forum. Investment is only painful or boring when you try to cram too much too fast, or you go find a dry, educational source and force feed yourself the information. Momentum is the most important piece when you start any new project. Too many people think Alright, it's time to do this investment stuff and go and buy some highly rated book on Amazon to start their education. That's such a self-defeating way to start. Is that how you got into skiing, or guitar or interpretive Celtic dance? Has that kind of textbook strategy ever succeeded in firing up your passion? Kachroo-Levine: For those seeking early retirement, can you share why your investments are so crucial to your early retirement journey? Livingston: Your nest egg is like an entire extra employee doing work for you, an employee that gets better and stronger and eventually eclipses you. Say you make $100,000 pre-tax and save $30,000 a year. Once your nest egg is three times your salary, or $300,000, at a 10% return it will generate as much as you slaving a whole year to put away has accomplished. At 10-times your salary and a 10% return, it is throwing off more money than you make in an entire year. You could be sitting on the beach drinking Mai Tais and still see a year's worth of salary come in just from your investments. Of course, you can't guarantee consistent 10% returns, but you have a long-term bet that you can achieve during your accumulation phase by investing in low-cost index funds.

Just look at 2016: Atlanta, The People v OJ, Veep, The Night Of, Stranger Things, Westworld... the list of brilliant TV shows goes on.  Many of the best - including the likes of Bojack Horseman, House of Cards, and The Walking Dead - took viewers down dark, emotional roads. The latter show, for instance, saw numerous popular characters killed off. The former saw an animated horse’s continued existential crises hit a new low. House of Cards offered another petrifying take on the political climate. One show many consider to have a doom-mongering, pessimistic view of life is Black Mirror, the Channel 4 show picked up by Netflix. Season three offered some of the darkest episodes yet: just look at \"Shut Up and Dance\", centring on a young man being blackmailed into doing terrible tasks for a group of hackers, featuring a horrendous final twist. Among those six new episodes, though, lies ‘San Junipero\\', a somewhat enigma when it comes to the series. Instead of telling a morbid, freighting tale about a dystopian future, creator - and the episode’s writer - Charlie Brooker decided to tell the wonderful love story of two women. **Spoilers ahead** In the episode, the wonderfully awkward Yorkie - played by Mackenzie Davis - falls helplessly in love with Kelly (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) while partying at the Californian beach resort San Junipero. This is no ordinary love story, though, as the pair mysteriously meet each other in different time periods over a number of weekends. How? Because San Junipero isn’t a real place: it’s a realistic virtual reality; a place the consciousness is uploaded to rather than physically visited.  It transpires that Yorkie - despite appearing to be in her 20s in San Junipero - is actually an elderly, paralysed woman, living in an assisted living facility with only six months left. Kelly, meanwhile, is actually based in a separate retirement home, seeing out her days in San Junipero.  Eventually, after overcoming some reticent feelings, the pair meet up in real life and marry so Kelly can formerly authorise Yorkie’s euthanasia, putting her out of her pain. Yorkie is then uploaded to San Junipero. Kelly, however, rejects Yorkie’s advances to also fully upload her consciousness to San Junipero once she dies because of a promise to her previous husband. After months of deliberating, and a worsening condition, Kelly decides to upload her consciousness to San Junipero, living out her days with Yorkie. Written down, it sounds like a semi-morbid tale of death. Yet, what transpires is a heartfelt tale of two women who decide, in spite of everything, to be together, their love overwhelming rational thinking. Is there really anything more life affirming than a love story where love reigns triumphant? Well, there’s one issue. As the episode finishes, there’s a lasting shot of the computer servers keeping Yorkie and Kelly’s consciousness ‘alive\\' - the ‘TCKR’ system. A reminder, that everything could be flicked off with the switch of a button/power outage. A haunting reminder to live every moment to the fullest.', 'text_b': None, 'label': False},\n",

Back then, Colicchio and his team already had hits on their hands with Craft and Craftbar—both groundbreaking farm-to-table restaurants when they first opened in Manhattan —and \\'Wichcraft was just meant to be a little sandwich shop spinoff. Ortuzar, who was then one of the chefs at Craft, \"was known for doing these great sandwiches after work and said hey, let’s do a sandwich restaurant. And that’s how \\'Wichcraft was born,\" Colicchio told The Feast. Over the years, that little sandwich shop has grown into a ubiquitous chain—which just opened its ninth branch and is opening its tenth in Grand Central this fall—thanks to Colicchio and Ortuzar\\'s knack for creating some of the most thrilling ingredient-driven sandwiches, soups and lunch offerings in NYC. Tom Colicchio (right) with Sisha Ortuzar. Still, as Colicchio himself admits, sometimes those lunch orders could take a little longer to prepare than a rushed and hungry customer might like. Now, with its brand-new location in Tribeca, Colicchio says the reconceived kitchen set-up will let the orders come out \"much faster.\" Its sandwiches, like the phenomenal BLT, will take an average of \"five minutes as opposed to 12-13 minutes,\" Colicchio said. The tweaking and rebranding of \\'Wichcraft will soon spread to all shops in the chain, and Colicchio said he\\'s hoping to expand \\'Wichcraft to other cities in the near future. In the meantime, anyone who won\\'t be visiting in person anytime soon can live vicariously through this must-try BLT recipe, which perfects the classic American sandwich. The BLT is available starting August 1 at the new Tribeca location and all the \\'Wichcraft shops.

(The sandwich shops use Eckerton Hill Farms tomatoes from the Union Square Greenmarket, along with Berkshire bacon.) After the season is over, it\\'s not just the tomatoes that\\'ll be gone. The sandwich will vanish too. \\'Wichcraft BLT Recipe: Makes 4 sandwiches 1 pound ripe heirloom or beefsteak tomatoes, sliced 1⁄2-inch thick (Tip: Sit the tomato stem side down on the counter and using a very sharp knife, slice it horizontally to prevent the juices from running out.) 1 pound thick-cut bacon 4 large leaves of Bibb lettuce 8 slices country bread 4 tablespoons aioli (see recipe below) Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper For the BLT: In a heavy skillet, over medium-high heat, cook the bacon until golden brown and crisp on both sides. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Toast the bread on one side only. Evenly spread the aioli on the toasted side of four slices of bread. Place the tomatoes on top of the aioli, making sure the slices don’t overlap and the surface of the bread is covered. Season the tomatoes with sea salt and pepper. Place the bacon over the tomatoes, followed by the lettuce. Close the sandwiches with the remaining four bread slices, toasted side down. Carefully cut into halves and serve. For the aioli: 1 large egg yolk, preferably from a pasture-raised egg 1⁄2 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1⁄2 teaspoon chopped garlic Pinch of cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar 1 cup grapeseed oil 1⁄2 teaspoon kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper Place the egg yolk, mustard, garlic, cayenne pepper, and vinegar in a food processor or blender. Start the blender and slowly add the grapeseed oi in a thin, even stream. When half of the oil has been added, add 1 tablespoon water.

Several users are reporting that Blizzard banned them again after they bought a new copy. A few even tried buying a 3rd copy and yet they got banned within 24 hours of playing the game.

The list of daily tasks for the care and upkeep of three children is seemingly endless — from the moment they leap out of bed between 7 and 7:15 to the moment they hit the pillows around 8 or 8:30. The 2-year-old must be changed, washed, brushed, soothed, fed, held, rocked, amused, and watched multiple times a day. My 9-year-old and 7-year-old have homework to supervise, friend dramas to negotiate, permission slips to sign, and activities to attend. They dress and bathe themselves, but someone must be vigilant at all times to keep them on track. Most Popular Truth be told, I work part-time, so the bulk of the child duties does fall to me. But my husband knows the score. He is responsible for preschool drop-off every morning. He picks up from gymnastics every Wednesday, and takes charge of math homework and making sure our son reads for exactly 20 minutes every night. He changes diapers and also has access to the giant family calendar that hangs in our mudroom to track everyone\\'s doctors appointments, playdates, birthday parties, and after-school activities. I might be behind the wheel mostly, but he\\'s always next to me in the front seat reading the map. So why the question? Our society is full of all kinds of families, but our leafy suburb just outside of New York City often feels like there is one kind: traditional two-parent homes where one parent (usually the dad) works full-time while the long-suffering mother does everything with her kids. When I went on a business trip for a week two years ago, a friend confided in me: \"My husband wouldn\\'t even be able to pack a lunch if I left.\" Why are we accepting this as normal? My husband regularly goes to California for work. Last year, there were long periods where he left every Tuesday and returned on Friday afternoon. Not once, in all those weeks of lonely nights and busy mornings, did anyone ask him who was watching the kids. It\\'s obvious, right? Daddies get to go out in the world. Mommies stay home. Mommy has it all under control. And I do. Mostly. But it\\'s not easy when one spouse travels. A job that really belongs to two people suddenly falls to one. It\\'s a fact my husband understands well. This is why I needed a vacation. Alone. \"How long are you gone again?\" he texted me on Wednesday, six days into my 11-day trip. I had to laugh. But that is all I did. Because I knew that back home, even though he felt like he was drowning, he would doggy paddle his way back to shore somehow. My toddler\\'s cot sheet might not get washed for preschool. And my son might get a B on a spelling test instead of his usual A, because my husband doesn\\'t ride him as hard as I would\\'ve if I was home. But my children would be clean, well-fed, and (mostly) smiling when I got back. And they were. My husband is not a babysitter. He is a parent just like me. Being alone with the kids is a challenge even for the most organized and dedicated among us. But that doesn\\'t make Daddy less capable of it. Upon my return, a friend said she could \"never do what you did.\" Her husband wouldn\\'t be able to keep it together. Not without massive amounts of help. And that\\'s exactly the reason to go. Kids need to know their daddies can care for them as well. Fathers have an equal part in creating them and should have an equal role in raising them. So go on. Leave the kids with Daddy. It\\'s good for everyone. And I promise when you do, I will never ask you who is taking care of them. Because I will already know.', 'text_b': None, 'label': True},\n",

According to the new poll, conducted after Typhoon Haiyan devastated the Philippines earlier this month, 55 percent of Americans think climate change is related to more frequent and severe natural disasters, while only 23 percent do not. Seventy-two percent of Democrats and 52 percent of independents, but only 39 percent of Republicans said that they are related. Forty-four percent of Republicans said that they're not. The poll shows that the vast majority of Americans think humans are contributing at least somewhat to climate change, but differ on just how much. In total, 70 percent of respondents said they think human activity is having at least some impact on climate change. But only 34 percent said human activity is the primary cause. Another 36 percent said human activity is not the cause, but contributes to climate change. Only 10 percent of respondents said human activity is not contributing to climate change at all and 9 percent said climate change is not occurring. Eighty-five percent of Democrats said humans are at least partially responsible for climate change, including 55 percent who said human activity is the primary cause. But Republicans and independents were less convinced. Sixty-eight percent of independents said humans are at least contributing, but only 29 percent said they are the primary cause. Among Republicans, only 15 percent said that human activity is the primary cause of climate change, although a total of 53 percent said that humans are at least a contributing factor. The poll finds that 28 percent of Americans think Typhoon Haiyan specifically was caused by climate change. Another 32 percent said it was not, and 41 percent said they weren't sure. Although scientists can't say with certainty whether a specific storm was caused by climate change, rising sea levels make storm surges from hurricanes and typhoons potentially more deadly in coastal areas, contributing to increased destruction.

              "  {'guid': 350, 'text_a': \"How Stephen Hawking Has Lived So Long With ALS - How Has Stephen Hawking Lived Past 70 with ALS?An expert on Lou Gehrig's disease explains what we know about this debilitating condition and how Hawking has beaten the odds Editor’s Note: Renowned theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking died on March 14, 2018, at age 76. This story, originally published on his 70th birthday on January 7, 2012, is being resurfaced to explain how he beat the odds and lived so long with the disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Stephen Hawking turns 70 on Sunday, beating the odds of a daunting diagnosis by nearly half a century. The famous theoretical physicist has helped to bring his ideas about black holes and quantum gravity to a broad public audience. For much of his time in the public eye, though, he has been confined to a wheelchair by a form of the motor-neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). And since 1985 he has had to speak through his trademark computer system—which he operates with his cheek—and have around-the-clock care. But his disease seems hardly to have slowed him down. Hawking spent 30 years as a full professor of mathematics at the University of Cambridge. And he is currently the director of research at the school's Center for Theoretical Cosmology. But like his mind, Hawking's illness seems to be singular. Most patients with ALS—also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, for the famous baseball player who succumbed to the disease—are diagnosed after the age of 50 and die within five years of their diagnosis. Hawking's condition was first diagnosed when he was 21, and he was not expected to see his 25th birthday. Why has Hawking lived so long with this malady when so many other people die so soon after diagnosis? We spoke with Leo McCluskey, an associate professor of neurology and medical director of the ALS Center at the University of Pennsylvania, to find out more about the disease and why it has spared Hawking and his amazing brain. What is ALS—and is there more than one form of it? ALS, which is also known as a motor-neuron disease—and colloquially as Lou Gehrig's disease in the U.S.—is a neurodegenerative disease. Each muscle is controlled by motor neurons that reside in the brain in the frontal lobe. These are controlled electrically and are synaptically connected to motor neurons that reside lower down in the brain—as well as motor neurons that reside in the spinal cord. The guys in the brain are called the upper motor neurons, and the guys in the spine are called the lower motor neurons. The disease causes weakness of either upper motor neurons or lower motor neurons or both. It's been known for quite some time that there are variants of ALS. One is referred to as progressive muscular atrophy, or PMA. It appears to be an isolated illness of the lower motor neurons. However, pathologically, if you do an autopsy of a patient, they will have evidence of deterioration of upper motor neurons. There is also primary lateral sclerosis—PLS—and clinically it looks like an isolated upper motor-neuron disorder. However, pathologically they also have lower motor-neuron disorder. The other classic syndrome is called progressive baldor palsy—or progressive supranuclear palsy—which is weakening of cranial muscles, like the tongue, face and swallowing muscles. But it pretty much always spreads to limb muscles. Those are the four classic motor-neuron disorders that have been described. And it was thought for quite some time that these disorders were limited to motor neurons. It's now clear that that's not true. It's now well recognized that 10 percent of these patients can develop degeneration in another part of the brain, such as other parts of the frontal lobe that don't contain the motor neurons or the temporal lobe. So some of these patients can actually develop dementia, called frontal-temporal lobe dementia. One of the misconceptions about ALS is that it's only a motor-neuron disease, and that's not true. What has Stephen Hawking's case shown about the disease? One thing that is highlighted by this man's course is that this is an incredibly variable disorder in many ways. On average people live two to three years after diagnosis. But that means that half the people live longer, and there are people who live for a long, long time. Life expectancy turns on two things: the motor neurons running the diaphragm—the breathing muscles. So the common way people die is of respiratory failure. And the other thing is the deterioration of swallowing muscles, and that can lead to malnutrition and dehydration. If you don't have these two things, you could potentially live for a long time—even though you're getting worse. What's happened to him is just astounding. He's certainly an outlier. Has he lived so long because he got the disease when he was young and had the juvenile-onset type? Juvenile-onset is diagnosed in the teenage years, and I don't know enough about his course to say. But it's probably something similar to juvenile-onset disorder, which is something that progresses very, very, very slowly. I have patients in my clinic who were diagnosed in their teens and are still alive in their 40s, 50s or 60s. But not having ever examined him or taken a history, it's a little hard for me to say. He's a very good example of the sparing of the non-motor parts of the brain that can occur. How frequent are these cases of very slow-progressing forms of ALS? I would say probably less than a few percent. How much do you think Stephen Hawking's longevity has been due to the excellent care that he has received versus the biology of his particular form of ALS? It's probably a little bit of both. I just know him from television, so I don't know what kind of interventions he's had. If he really isn't on a ventilator, then it's his biology—it's the biology of his form of the neurodegenerative disease that determines how long he will live. For trouble swallowing you can elect to have a feeding tube placed, which basically takes malnutrition and dehydration off the table. But mostly it's about the biology of the disease. Hawking obviously has quite the active mind, and previous statements that he has made seem to indicate he has a pretty positive mental outlook, despite his condition. Is there any evidence that lifestyle and psychological well-being do much to help with patients' outcomes? Or is the disease usually too quick for that to make a difference? I don't believe that adds to longevity. ALS still doesn't have a cure. What have we learned about the disease recently that might help us find one—or at least better treatments? Beginning in 2006 it became clear that like a lot of other neurodegenerative diseases, ALS was determined by the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the brain. Ten percent of ALS is genetic and based on a gene mutation. I'm sure there are also at-risk genes for ALS, but there are now multiple genes that have been identified as potentially causing the disease. Each one of them are interesting in that they lead to the accumulation of different proteins in the brain. Knowing specific genes gives us particular mechanisms in the brain, and would potentially give us targets for therapies. But none of this has given us any robust therapies yet. What does Stephen Hawking's case mean for people who have the disease? It's just an incredible, incredible example of the variability of the disease—and the hope for patients who have it that they could also live a long life. Unfortunately, it's a small percentage of people for whom that actually happens.\", 'text_b': None, 'label': True},\n",

And Makes A Stunning Discovery.Investigating strange cries emanating from a West Virginia dumpster sounds like the start of a horror movie. Chances are, there would be nothing inside one of those that would make your day any better. But James Butler might disagree with you there. James was strolling through Coonskin Park, a riverside sliver of nature located in Kanawha County, West Virginia, when he heard a strange noise coming from one of the dumpsters there. Curiosity piqued, he investigated, only to discover something that had him fumbling for his camera... Retired West Virginia police officer and aviation enthusiast James Butler heard strange cries coming from a Charleston, West Virginia, dumpster on Tuesday, August 11, 2015. Curious, he investigated the sounds. Right away, he noticed two things. Five raccoons were trapped inside the Coonskin Park trash receptacle, and one of those raccoons was like nothing he\\'d ever seen before. As to how they got stuck, James said, \"The dumpster had apparently been emptied and the garbage level was low and the raccoons couldn’t reach the top to get back out.\" And that rare raccoon? He didn\\'t really look like like his family members—or like any raccoon James had ever seen! This trashmonger was an albino raccoon, an incredibly rare specimen according to the Indiana Division of Fish and Wildlife. How rare, exactly? The organization stated only one in 750,000 raccoons inherit the albino gene, a mutation that means the animal creates no melanin and therefore has no pigmentation. Stunned by his find, James didn\\'t forget the real trouble at hand—these raccoons were stuck. Thinking quickly, James fabricated a little something to help the raccoons escape their trash pit prison: a wood plank. He leaned it on the inside of the dumpster, and the raccoons could use it like a ramp! They were free—but that brought consequences. The albino raccoon had been \"a well-kept secret\" in Coonskin Park, according to Rodney Jones, chief of Kanawha\\'s Park Police Department. And once James shared his pictures online, Officer Jones feared it would become the subject of the public\\'s curious cameras... \"Now that the albino’s getting publicity,\" Rodney said, \"I figure people will start looking to see if they can find it around the park.\" And people searching for a wild animal—with a wild animal\\'s instincts—can be trouble. \"We try to tell people with animals to keep their distance and don’t try to feed them,\" he said after emphasizing that raccoons carry deadly diseases. \"I\\'d really hate to see an animal like that be destroyed because of someone’s curiosity or stupidity.\" Worse, the albino raccoon\\'s appearance can make it a \"prize\" in the eyes of some people. Something special that needs to be captured or owned. Such was the case with a four-year-old albino raccoon in Georgia... For part of her early life, Isis the albino raccoon had a miserable existence. Because of her unique look, someone captured her and locked her in a small, wire cage, intending to use her for a taxidermy project. Luckily, there was good news in store for her... The Georgia Department of Natural Resources rescued Isis and delivered the raccoon to Maxine Rainey, below, director of the Georgia animal sanctuary, A New Hope. But both the sanctuary and the department of natural resources feared she was a lost cause... Understandably, Isis was aggressive. Human touch scared her, and she lashed out at anyone trying to help her. \"Since she was described as so aggressive,\" Maxine said, \"we were just going to hold her for a couple of days.\" But then what? When Maxine accepted the albino raccoon, she gave the poor animal a look over: she had urine burns, smelled horrendous, was obese, losing hair, and had sores all over her feet. No wonder she was aggressive. Maxine, though, had hope for the poor animal. She sat in the enclosure with the animal that, by all accounts, should\\'ve been trying to tear her head off if she got too close. But amazingly, that didn\\'t happen. \"I\\'d been going through some stuff in my personal life, Maxine said, \"and I was kind of having a sad day, so I...sat by her and she came right up to me....she came up and sniffed me, and put her little hands in my hand.\" From there, the raccoon\\'s life only got better. \"She\\'s so gentle,\" Maxine said. \"She spent the last couple days glued to my side, sleeping on my lap, having me carry her around...I just saw a complete 180-degree flip in her personality the minute she was exposed to some kindness.\" For a raccoon once deemed so aggressive she had to be kept away from other raccoons at the facility, that\\'s a pretty glowing review! But the story of Isis only underscored the worry of Rodney Jones, the chief of Kanawha’s Park Police Department... People like James Butler are often fascinated with animals that are different and unique, but it\\'s important to remember they\\'re wild animals—potentially dangerous and capable of love and affection. They\\'re to be admired from afar! James had the right idea when he saw the albino raccoon: he took some photos, set him free from the dumpster, and let him go on his way.

He’s like Tim Tebow, but Wilson doesn’t look like he’s going back to baseball any time soon. At age 27 there is definitely more to come for the Seattle Seahawks quarterback. Not only does he have two Super Bowl appearances and a championship to his name, but he just earned another ring after tying the knot with Ciara. With the Seahawks in the middle of training camp and only three days away from their preseason opener against the Chiefs, we had a chance to chat with Wilson about a recent commercial he shot with Bose for their QuietComfort35 headphones. Over the phone, the three-time Pro Bowler and Super XLVIII Champion talked about his unusual—at least for your average NFL player’s standards—taste in music, the future of the Seattle Seahawks, and how married life is treating him. So what is this Bose commercial looking like? It’s gonna be a good commercial. I’m not giving away too much, I want people to see it first. Kinda can’t tell too much, but it was a great commercial. It’s so much fun shooting those commercials, especially with Bose. They’re very first class in everything they do, and I’m a big music person, as you know. I listen to tons of music, and we always have music playing around the house, Ciara and I, but also on the field, too. I have the wireless headphones in the locker room and the training room, and we listen to music when we’re watching film, all those things, so I’m constantly just listening to music. I think it can bring me a sense of peace and allows me to cancel out all the noise. I just like focusing on the things I need to focus on. You have one song to listen to before kickoff, what’re you listening to? That’s a great question. \"I’m Gonna Be Ready\" by Yolanda Adams . That’s probably my go-to song. Before a game, I’m always listening to gospel music. I’m just so grateful on game day. I don’t try to be all amped up. I try to be calm as can be and just grateful that I can play the game. It’s a special, special day, those days. So you’re not listening to Drake, Eminem, or anyone like that before kickoff? Nah, I’m chillin’ out. The NFL said they’re going to teach referees to call questionable catches incomplete if they aren’t 100 percent sure. You’ve been a part of questionable catches, how do you feel about what the NFL is trying to do? I think ultimately the NFL and all the players, we just want it to be called the right way, whatever that is. That’s the simplicity of it. It’s not that complicated. I think the biggest thing is, the referees, they always want to make the right call, and us as players, we always want them to make the right call as well.

Before a game, I’m always listening to gospel music. I’m just so grateful on game day. I don’t try to be all amped up. In the last four years, you have faced a division rival in the playoffs. What’s it like to face a team in the division in the postseason? Our division, in my opinion, is one of the hardest divisions, for sure, the NFC West. So many talented players, so many talented teams. When you go against the 49ers twice a year, you go against the Rams twice a year, you go against the Arizona Cardinals twice a year, that’s not an easy conference, but we try to...the ultimate goal for us is to go 1-0 every week and to block out all the noise and to focus on one game in a week. That’s a big part of my philosophy, and our team philosophy is just to go 1-0 every week and just try to win that one game and see what happens. You were ranked 17th in the NFL Top 100. Where would you rank yourself, and what do you have to do to be ranked higher next year? That’s not for me to worry about. All I care about is our team winning; that’s the only thing that matters. The rest will handle itself. That’s my only focus, man. All that stuff like I said, I just try to block out all that noise, ignore the noise, and like I said, winning a game, and a big part of that is kind of my regimen—how I get ready for the offseason, how I get ready for a game, and the focus you put into all the hard work that you put into everything you do, and Bose definitely plays a part of that; my music plays a major part of that. What did you make of the Hall of Fame Game being canceled? I think it was the right decision in terms of players safety. It always comes down to players’ safety. There was the big blockbuster trade where you guys got Jimmy Graham last year. You guys were ranked low in tight end receptions, and Jimmy only had 48 catches in 11 games. How come his numbers went down? Unfortunately, he didn’t get to play the whole season. Kinda holds him back, but we always wanna get better, and we always wanna do more. So we’re looking forward to him being back out there on the field. He’s gonna do a great job. How much did Marshawn Lynch mean to this team and your play? Marshawn’s a great football player. He’s always gonna be well respected across the league. Now, guys gotta step up, and we can’t wait. We have a great team, we have a lot of great players. I’m excited about the running back group that we have stepping in. Those guys are gonna do a great job, and we’re looking forward to having a great season. Are you concerned the Legion of Boom won’t last much longer with more free agency talks and contracts coming up for them? I think the Legion of Boom is going to be great once again. I’m excited about all the things that they’re gonna do this year. Our team, just in general, our offense and defense and special teams—you take it one day at a time. Congratulations on the marriage, how is the married life? It’s a blessing man, to find someone so special, so sweet. She’s one of the best people you can ever meet, one of the best moms you can ever meet. I’m just grateful for that. Your celebrity has reached new heights. From third-round pick out of college to a couple Super Bowl appearances as the quarterback of one of the best teams in the league—so what is the craziest headline you have ever heard about yourself? Awh man, I don’t pay attention to any of that stuff. I’m just grateful I get to play the game of football. I’m just grateful I get to take the God-given ability that God has given me and just spread it across to my teammates and for us to play together and try to hopefully win another Super Bowl, and that’s kind of my singular focus.

Gone in my house are the days when the most expensive item on the list was the ever-elusive \"just this size\" binder. Now, we’re talking calculators that rival my electricity bill. But I sigh, watch the ads, and get out there and do it. I put on my thickest armor because nothing will be just right for my kids. The kitty folders are too childish; the more mature ones are $200 a piece. Add to that the hysterical mobs crowding the $1 pencils like they were the last chance to win tickets to a 21 Pilots concert, and we have a joyfest that keeps on giving. (Insert sarcastic eye roll here). Yes, I’m frustrated. And let’s talk about that list, shall we? I mean, who in their right mind thinks it’s a good idea to request that our kids purchase Expo markers in bulk or boxes of Kleenex that should be supplied already? ESPECIALLY when those might not get used by my kids? Who thinks it should be my job to bring Ziploc bags to school? Well, I’ll tell you who. This mom. I’m not going to buy just the one extra box of tissues because (let’s all be honest here) I can afford more than that. And *gasp* what if someone other than my precious Timmy uses them? Well, then, haven’t I done a good deed for the year for less than the cost of a coffee? We should all be interested in what will create the best learning environment for all these kids, for all these little people who will be making big decisions some day like what to do with YOUR Social Security or how to fix YOUR city infrastructure or how best to treat that cancerous mass in YOUR body. If you don’t agree with something on the list and think it’s excessive, have a conversation with the teacher. I guarantee if it is something that will actually get used to educate your children, the teacher will be able to explain how. Yes, Expo markers are expensive. Get in a classroom and watch children solve problems at their desks (sometimes ON them) with them and really engage in the process because it all of a sudden became colorful and perhaps a little bit taboo. You think you have to buy too many glue sticks? I invite you to join a class when they do a simple sorting and gluing project that gives the kids one more opportunity to understand all the \"-augh\" words and their various pronunciations and watch multiple children go through half a stick just for that one project. More is more, right? And yes, the theory is that you teach them to use less, but let’s be honest: some just use what they use. Watch kids \"clean\" the floor at the end of the day and, in a rush to get home, throw away all the \"trash\" they found, which includes half used pencils and crayons that would take too long to find a home for. So, let’s fast forward to January. The supplies are no longer new and shiny, and more than a few have met their untimely trash can demise. Used and broken crayons look better in that circular file than in pencil boxes. Glue sticks that still have some in them but are not the easiest to use just aren’t worth it anymore. Markers find new homes in backpacks. Pencils that have no erasers have lost their appeal. Dry erase markers are dried up because they have been used to solve, spell, create. And then what happens? Supplies that were an extra $10 from you at the beginning of the year for one kid become extras in your kid’s teacher’s cart at Target during a grocery run. And forget the $10. Oh no. Multiply that sucker by – how many kids were in that classroom? Was it 20? 30? Let’s see. Does your job ask you to shell out a couple hundred bucks to upgrade your software or buy staples? And if it’s teaching your kid how to multiply better or be able to compose a sentence without referring to spell check, isn’t that extra $10 a little worth it? I’m frustrated by our entitlement. We act like we’re doing the schools and the teachers a favor when we fill that backpack with tissues and markers. Umm, let’s back up a minute. Aren’t they the ones doing us the favor? I mean, are we willing to take a step (or 200) backward and fill in gaps caused by something as silly as a distracted kid (who then distracts others) because he can’t find a glue stick to finish his project? And yes, we went through school without some of these things, but these kids are more accustomed to bright and shiny. Maybe sad, but still true. And if bright and shiny go away, attention spans shorten, and kids are more disruptive. And guess what? Kids don’t learn as well then. I’m frustrated that we can’t see just how big a job these incredibly underpaid teachers are undertaking. So, my suggestion is to watch for sales and stock up. Buy the extra box of tissues. Do the right thing and thank that teacher for all the efforts to make our future decision-makers great ones. Be frustrated with me for the right reasons.', 'text_b': None, 'label': True},\n",

The state legislature there recently extended its 6 percent sales tax to digital downloads and subscription services like Netflix and Hulu. Though it\\'s called the Netflix tax, colloquially at least, the fee will also apply to streaming and downloads for music, e-books and apps. Digital versions of newspapers, magazines and the Bible, will be exempt. Pennsylvania joins a select group of locations that have begun to put local taxes on digital services. Chicago already has a similar 9-percent tax, often called its \"cloud tax.\" Digital goods are also taxable in Minnesota. Similar taxes have come up in Canada. Netflix even battled in Kentucky over telecommunications taxes there, a way some states have tried to tax digital services without imposing a sales tax. The sales taxes, like the one in Pennsylvania, are applied when a customer uses a billing address in a city or state with an applicable sales tax. So if you want to avoid the Netflix tax, borrow a billing address outside the state. At least until the Netflix tax comes for us all, that is. Pennsylvania is taxing netflix spotify and apple music.

              "  {'guid': 365, 'text_a': 'New data reveals who\\'s likely to get married more than once - Pew Report Reveals Who\\'s Likely To Get Married More Than OnceGood news for romantics: The divorce rate may be dismal, but remarriage is on the rise. According to new findings from the Pew Research center, 40 percent of marriages involve one spouse who\\'s been married before. In 20 percent of new marriages, both spouses have previously said \"I do.\" \"There\\'s so much dialogue right now about the retreat from marriage in general,\" Gretchen Livingston, Senior Researcher at Pew and author of the study, told The Huffington Post. \"I was really curious to juxtapose that with what\\'s going on with remarriage.\" Livingston analyzed data from the 2013 American Community Survey as well as the 1960 and 1980 censuses and found that the number of remarried adults in the US has hit 42 million, which is almost double the amount recorded in 1980 and triple the amount in 1960. But not everyone is jumping to remarry -- after combining the hard data on remarriage patterns with the results of a recent Pew survey about marriage, Livingston found that specific demographics are actually less likely to remarry than others. Among those who are divorced or widowed, age made a big difference in desire to remarry. There are two demographic shifts that can account for this general surge in remarriage, according to Livingston. For one, the divorce rate is higher now than it was in 1960, so the number of people who are, as she put it, \"eligible\" to remarry has also risen. (But it\\'s worth noting that the divorce rate peaked in 1981 and has been slowly declining and leveling off ever since.) The more influential factor in the high remarriage rate, however, is a longer life expectancy for partners, particularly among baby boomers. While only 34 percent of those who were 65 and older (and eligible to remarry) had remarried in 1960, 50 percent of that same demographic had remarried in 2013. \"The older you are, the more likely you are to have ever remarried, because you have more time in your life to have married once, gotten divorced or widowed and found someone else and remarried,\" Livingston said. Younger Americans went the opposite direction: 75 percent of people ages 25 to 34 and eligible to remarry were remarried in 1960, while only 43 percent of that same demographic were remarried in 2013. It\\'s very possible that this younger group of contemporary divorcees and widows hasn\\'t soured on the institution of marriage completely, however. Livingston pointed out that, since younger demographics have tended to delay marriage -- the average age of first marriage is now is about 27 for women and 29 for men, as opposed to 21 for women and 24 for men in 1960 -- perhaps this group is content to cohabit with partners or advance the relationship in other ways, rather than jump into marriage number two. Overall, women were less likely than men to want to walk down the aisle again. Age wasn\\'t the only differentiating factor, though. When Pew polled participants for the aforementioned survey on marriage, they asked single men and women who had been married before if they would be willing to marry again. There was a clear gender divide: Divorced or widowed men were more likely to want to remarry than women in the same position. A majority of once-married, eligible men -- 65 percent -- either expressed a desire to remarry or were still considering it. In comparison, 43 percent of women said they\\'d be willing to remarry and 54 percent specifically didn\\'t want to ever marry again. Only 30 percent of men were completely against the idea of a second walk down the aisle. Previous studies have suggested that men enjoy more health benefits, relationship satisfaction and economic perks from marriage than women do. Livingston said it\\'s quite possible that widowed or divorced men have more motivation to jump back into a new marriage and regain those aforementioned comforts. Another interesting finding combined both age and gender: In remarriages, 16 percent of couples involve a husband who is at least 10 years older than his wife. This age gap falls to a mere 4 percent in first-time married couples. If you consider that 39 percent of first-time newlyweds (and 21 percent of remarried couples) are within a year of each other\\'s ages, this age gap among remarried couples becomes particularly noteworthy. But don\\'t make too many assumptions about newlyweds -- it\\'s a demographic that\\'s still in flux. While today\\'s divorce rate might make newlyweds of the 1960s cringe, that doesn\\'t mean that today\\'s society has lost faith in marriage. In fact, according to Pew, previously married people these days are just as willing to remarry as they were back in 1960. Taken together, these findings can add more detail to an ever-shifting image of the American family. \"Maybe newlyweds don\\'t look quite as fresh-faced as they did in the late \\'60s,\" Livingston said, noting once again that 40 percent of today\\'s newlywed couples involve at least one person who\\'s been married before. \"But I think it\\'s very striking and just another example of how the definitions of family and the norm are changing.\"', 'text_b': None, 'label': False},\n",

Flu season is here, and enterovirus D68 has spread to all but three states in the continental U.S. Handwashing can protect against both, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We should be doing more of it throughout the day, but it\\'s our bathroom handwashing habits that have been carefully studied -- and they are disgusting. The simple step is something many consider unnecessary in communal spaces, from your office restroom to bar bathrooms. Some people go so far as to turn on the sink and let the water run, so it only sounds like they\\'re washing their hands. When researchers hid in a public restroom in a Michigan college town, they reported that 10 percent of people didn\\'t wash their hands after using the bathroom, and nearly one in four just rinsed with water. The average handwashing time? Six seconds, far short of the CDC\\'s recommendation for a 20-second scrub. Men were more than twice as likely as women to leave without washing up. \"Men are less concerned about things,\" study author Carl P. Borchgrevink, an associate professor at Michigan State University, tells The Huffington Post. \"They\\'re not as thoughtful and they don\\'t like to be told what to do.\" Men also seemed to think they were clean if they were dealing only with their genitalia. \"Many men suggested that unless they had a bowel movement, there would be no need for washing their hands,\" Borchgrevink says. Michael Sykes, founder of the humor site the International Center for Bathroom Etiquette, says that the act of peeing is so easy for men that it may not register as a way of spreading germs. \"Men don\\'t have to do much more than unzip their pants to take a pee, and they might simply feel like going to the bathroom is so insignificant as to not even merit a hand washing,\" he writes to HuffPost in an email. Seventy percent of people confessed to sometimes rinsing without soap, and 81 percent said they had witnessed a \"non-washing event\" in a public restroom within the past year, according to a 2013 survey by Bradley Corporation, which happens to be a manufacturer of bathroom products. Again, men were the grossest offenders: Only 60 percent said they always washed their hands after using a public bathroom, compared to 74 percent of women.

              "  {'guid': 381, 'text_a': '\"Pluto’s Little Sister\" Makemake Has Something Even Pluto Doesn\\'t » Second Nexus - \"Pluto’s Little Sister\" Makemake Has Something Even Pluto Doesn’tThe dwarf planet Makemake, discovered in 2005, is cold, dark and remote. It sits in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, orbiting the sun at a distance almost 46 times farther away than Earth and completing an orbit once every 310 Earth-years. Recent observation by the Hubble Space Telescope, however, has revealed that Makemake is not as lonely as it once appeared: it has a moon. Finding a Dark Moon Until this new discovery, scientists believed Makemake was the only one of the four officially recognized dwarf planets in the Kuiper belt (Pluto, Haumea, Makemake and Eris) without a moon - the fifth official dwarf planet, Ceres, is closer to Earth and also moonless. However, there were some inconsistencies in prior measurements of Makemake’s light and heat. Observations from the Spitzer and Herschel space telescopes revealed warm, dark areas on Makemake’s otherwise bright, cold surface. However, Makemake’s apparently mottled surface would not make sense with a normally rotating dwarf planet unless it was spinning with one of its poles facing directly toward Earth, a fairly unlikely situation. The \"dark moon hypothesis\" offered a simpler explanation: a charcoal-black moon orbiting Makemake. \"Imagine that the dark material isn’t on Makemake’s surface... it’s in orbit!\" image analysis lead and paper coauthor Alex Parker tweeted. \"If the moon is very dark, it accounts for most previous thermal measurements!\" Makemake is the second-farthest away of the official dwarf planets (Eris is the farthest) and the second-brightest (after Pluto). While it may seem strange that astronomers had been able to see moons around farther and dimmer planets while missing Makemake’s moon, the reality is that this moon, informally called MK2, was very good at remaining hidden. MK2 is over 1300 times dimmer and much smaller than Makemake, and its orbit appears to be edge-on to Earth, so we don’t see it circling Makemake, only oscillating back and forth. Looking for it is like looking for a firefly flitting back and forth across a spotlight. If you watch it long enough and are lucky enough to look at the right time, as this team of astronomers did, the firefly might look obvious (in Parker’s words, \"not actually that faint\"), but it was easy to miss before. Part of a team from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, Parker was the first to notice Makemake’s moon in data from the Hubble Space Telescope. At first, he thought someone else must have already seen it. Just to be sure, he asked collaborator and team leader Marc Buie, \"Has anyone seen the moon in the Makemake data?\" When Buie replied, \"There’s a moon in the Makemake data?\" they knew they’d made a major discovery. The Moon in the Data It is unclear where exactly the moon came from or why its surface is black. More observations of MK2 from Hubble will help astronomers determine whether its orbit is circular or elliptical, which will provide clues to its origin. If MK2’s orbit is elongated, it was probably simply captured in Makemake’s gravity as it floated by. Many smaller Kuiper Belt Objects have dark surfaces like MK2. This is often because they are too small and their gravity too weak to keep bright ices (like the ones that cover Makemake) in place. However, MK2’s darkness could be due to constant interactions with the escaping atmospheric gases streaming off Makemake: like the top of a hearth blackened with ash, it could have accumulated compounds from Makemake’s past atmosphere. If MK2’s orbit is circular, as preliminary estimates indicate, the moon may be merely debris from a collision between Makemake and another Kuiper Belt Object. If MK2 was created by an enormous crash between two Kuiper Belt Objects, according to the paper, \"The apparent ubiquity of trans-Neptunian dwarf planet satellites further supports the idea that giant collisions are a near-universal fixture in the histories of these distant worlds.\" If all of the dwarf planets have satellites (moons), that may mean that Kuiper Belt Objects are often subjected to huge impacts. The New, Improved Makemake System While MK2 does create questions about the Makemake system and the Kuiper Belt, it will also provide answers. According to Parker, \"The discovery of this moon has given us an opportunity to study Makemake in far greater detail than we ever would have been able to without the companion.\"  Makemake is sometimes referred to as \"Pluto’s little sister\" because of their similarities: both are dwarf planets, both have surfaces coated in methane ice, and both have temperatures that can drop to -400 degrees Fahrenheit. The discovery that Makemake has a moon adds yet another similarity to Pluto. When Pluto’s largest moon, Charon, was discovered in 1978, it led to enormous new insights about Pluto itself, including that it was hundreds of times lighter than was originally estimated. \"That\\'s the kind of transformative measurement that having a satellite can enable,\" Parker said: MK2 will almost definitely lead to a fundamental change in how we view the dwarf planet Makemake. Looking at how MK2 orbits Makemake will allow scientists to calculate the system’s mass and probe its inner composition. As Caltech’s Mike Brown, a member of the team that discovered Makemake in 2005, said, \"The wide range of densities of the dwarf planets is one of the most interesting mysteries out there. But we still have so few objects that each one adds a critical part of the story.\" Small worlds like Makemake display a variety of internal compositions: they can contain rock and water ice, as well as other, more \"exotic\" ices and compounds. Since MK2 will allow scientists to tell Makemake’s density and thus the densities of the materials it’s made of, it provides a new clue about the family of dwarf planets. The James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled to launch in 2018, will be able to conclusively test the dark moon hypothesis. Even before then, though, information about Makemake and its moon will continue to accumulate from new Hubble observations, teaching us about the outskirts of our solar system. \"This new discovery opens a new chapter in comparative planetology in the outer solar system,\" Buie said, and it will add to our understanding of the many worlds around us.', 'text_b': None, 'label': True},\n",

She couldn’t tell why, since she had always been slender. She went from 126 pounds to 224 pounds in two years. When she went to her doctor to try to find a reason she was gaining weight so rapidly, they told her that it was just her metabolism slowing down, and if she wanted it to come off she should eat less calories. So she did. But even eating 1000 calories per day, nothing changed. Not only that, but she experienced a rash on her face. She decided to do some private research.

The tumor was on her pituitary gland, which was preventing her from losing weight. She had Cushing\\'s disease. If left undetected, it could have killed her. By the time she had the MRI, she had gone up ten dress sizes. Lizzie finally had an answer to what was causing her unhealthy weight gain, but it wasn’t without psychological cost. \"I believed the doctors after I first saw them,\" said Lizzie, \"but over time I thought there was something else wrong because I’ve always been thin.\" Her mother worried about her too.

Brenda\\'s Story & 14 Day Anti-Aging Results: Brenda is a 57 year old mother of 3 from here in Chicago. Like most women her age, the years have started to give her unwanted lines and wrinkles. Brenda said she volunteered because she is so frustrated that nothing she has tried seems to work. She was even considered highly risky and very expensive facelift procedure. This was somewhat of a last resort for her. Here are her results.... Day One: After the first day of using Neuphoric Anti-Aging Cream , I was surprised at how wonderful it made my skin feel. It felt like every last pore on my face was being tightened and pulled by a gigantic vacuum cleaner. I don\\'t know how else to describe it! I could feel a warm tingling sensation on my cheeks, around my eyes, and on my forehead. I looked in the mirror and saw that my face looked a bit rosy - the result of revitalizing blood rushing to the surface of my skin to renew my face. After both products were absorbed into my skin, my face looked firmer and had a beautiful glow to it. day 5: After five days of using Neuphoric Anti-Aging Cream , I was shocked at the drastic results. The lines, dark spots, and wrinkles - without question - were visibly reduced in size right before my eyes! I was astonished by the results, and literally felt 15 years younger again. It was like watching all my wrinkles and fine lines vanish right off! day 14: After 14 days, not only had all my doubts and scepticism absolutely vanished - SO DID MY WRINKLES! The lines on my forehead, the loose, sagging skin on my neck, my crows feet even the age spots on my face had COMPLETELY disappeared. I\\'ve never felt or seen anything tighten my skin with this kind of force before, no matter how expensive the product! After the 2 weeks, my skin not only stayed that way, it actually improved every day until it became as beautiful and radiant as it was 20 years ago. By this point, all my friends and family were shocked. They couldn\\'t believe the difference, and were convinced I was lying about not getting botox! The Verdict: Using the Neuphoric Anti-Aging Cream daily removed virtually 90% of all her wrinkles and problem areas. It tightened her face and neck, removing all signs of sagging, aging, and dehydrated skin. We had her track her progress for the 14 day test. Here is what she saw: Will This Work For You?

The main reason of excitement for this new AAA game is the setting. Unlike most of the other shooting games nowadays, which are set in modern or futuristic universe, Battlefield 1 is set during World War I. This will definitely give the players some new experience and a fresh perspective. Although we are all excited about Battlefield 1, we are actually lucky that the game’s setting didn’t get rejected. While speaking at the Investors Day event, EA Studios Executive Vice President Patrick Soderlund said that the setting was originally not approved by EA. The thing that Andrew spoke about in regards to the setting and why we decided to go for World War I, it wasn’t the most obvious choice. If you look at what other partners in our industry are going, they’re going into sci-fi, we had a lot of success with in the modern military space, but we felt that there was a need for a change, and when the team presented to me the idea of World War I, I absolutely rejected it.\" However, things changed after DICE showed him a small demo of what it had in mind. This convinced him that the idea could actually work and the company bit the bullet and it paid off big time. I said , World War I is trench warfare, it can’t be fun to play.’ But anyway the team continued to persist in the fact that this can be fun, and showed up with a very short demo that convinced me at least that this was the right path Soderlund was amazed by the reception the trailer for Battlefield 1 got and he seemed very pleased that the audience connected in the way it did with the company’s decision to switch from modern-day setting to world war 1. The good news is that whenever you take creative risks, and it works, you actually can get to substantial success, and I think that what the internet is telling us with 31 million views and the most seen trailer of the history of EA is that the World War I theme is resonating with players out there. I think we have done something that will be right for the franchise and right for EA.\" Battlefield 1 is looking set to break all kinds of sales records and this might finally be the year when it manages to dethrone the Call of Duty franchise from the number 1 position.', 'text_b': None, 'label': False},\n",

Smooth, pink, fleshy, and unbearably smelly, this chunky conundrum simply couldn’t be identified – at least at first. Mark Watkins, a fisherman of 21 years, had clearly never seen anything like it. \"When we got closer we realized it had to be a dead whale because of the smell,\" he told the West Australian. \"Its stomach was full of gas so it was all bloated up.\" The stomachs of whales tend to be full of gas during life, but this is normally kept under control. Floating up to the surface some time after death, the Sun\\'s rays began to hit the whale\\'s abdomen, causing the gases to expand and ultimately forcing the stomach to swell up. On occasion, this can cause the cetacean to explode with dramatic, gore-filled fury. After drifting away from the carcass, Watkins spotted it beginning to deflate. It looked like a few sharks had turned up and taken a few bites out of the ex-whale, which had caused its gastrointestinal gas and fluids to flood out into the Indian Ocean. Although the exact species of the whale hasn’t been declared, it’s likely to be a humpback or southern right whale, two of the most common types found off the western Australian coastline. \"Seeing it was great,\" Watkins noted on Facebook. \"The smell, not so much.\" Clearly, the entire experience was quite over-whale-ming (sorry).

For the United States, the bill comes to $634 billion owed to developing nations. The U.S. also would need to cut carbon emissions 55 percent to 65 percent, according to the Stockholm Environment Institute, Friends of the Earth, and Jubilee South Asia Pacific Movement for Debt and Development. Worldwide, developed nations would have to pay more than $1.1 trillion annually to developing nations on top of massive emission reductions to keep climate change in check. The environmental groups created an online tool showing how much each country should cut emissions and how much money should be given to developing countries not fully responsible for global warming but that would be devastated by climate change nonetheless. That even includes nations such as China, now the world’s largest carbon emitter. How did the environmental groups come up with such exact figures? The first scientific attempt to calculate each country’s \"fair share\" factored in historical emissions, its wealth, and its current population. That means poor, populous, undeveloped countries would be the beneficiaries of funds from rich, developed nations to cut their emissions and help produce access to energy for the 2 billion people living largely off the grid. \"We call this a part of the climate debt owed to us, and it is needed if we are to confront climate change while still responding to the needs of people,\" Lidy Nacpil, director at Jubilee South Asia Pacific Movement on Debt and Development, said in a statement. \"It’s not just a question of being fair. It’s about being realistic. To be realistic means if we want a hope of stopping climate change, these transfers have to happen. These deep cuts have to happen. That’s the realistic demand from people facing the full brutal force of climate change.\" The tool’s calculations are based on the latest International Panel on Climate Change report, which puts precise figures on emission cuts and money amounts needed to hold an increase in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2025. Sivan Kartha, a senior scientist at Stockholm Environment Institute, said that IPCC’s numbers show that temperature increases greater than 2 degrees could have irreversible effects on the world’s climate. \"Based on those limits on climate pollution for the whole world, it is striking just how quickly emissions need to come down, across the world. It may be hard to do, but it’s dramatically easier than surviving 2, 3, 4 degrees of warming,\" Kartha said. Kartha added that the online calculator shows not just what the whole world has to do to mitigate climate change but also helps answer the fundamental question in U.N. climate talks of what each country should do. But how do we know all those billions transferred among nations would be put to good use and not squandered? Alex Rafalowicz, a fellow at the Washington-based Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, said the creation of a transparent U.N.

So before applying your make-up pack on a rich moisturiser, which will leave your skin feeling nourished and smoother.  Always do your brows: Brows tend to thin as we age, but having a structured brow can take years off of your face, instantly lifting and defining your eye area. Karla advises avoiding gels and pencils - which can leave brows looking too harsh and ‘drawn on’ - and opt for a powder formula, which will give a much more natural finish. \\'Never go too dark as this can age you, aim to choose only a shade or two darker than your hair colour,\\' she adds.

Avoid dark eyes: Celebrity facialist and makeup artist, Nathalie Eleni, says that dark kohl under the eye can look harsh if not blended so opt for a softer shadow and blend along for a softer finish. Apply under-eye cream correctly: Eva Alexandrides, managing director and co-founder of 111Skin, explains that the skin underneath the eye is a different structure to the rest of the face and thus is a lot more sensitive. \\'Rubbing and pulling at the skin as you apply the cream is a real no go and will make the bags appear worse and more visible. \\'Use your ring or little finger when applying cream whilst only dabbing, tapping or softly massaging the area with sweeping strokes.

What Science Is Saying About Fiction ReadersWill S. For most, the love of books starts in childhood. For others, this love blooms later, eventually revealing the vibrant colors of a true bibliophile! But science has started looking into the effects of reading on the brain. They’ve done experiments, ran MRIs, polled, and surveyed, all to what end? Studies have been released in the past several years that have given scientists some interesting data about fiction readers and what type of fiction they should read! What has science concluded? Studies are showing that readers of fiction are more empathetic towards others. By engaging with a story, readers are temporarily placing themselves in a character’s shoes, therefore, the more stories you read, the more shoes you’ve tried on. It’s a fascinating insight into the world of reading. In 2012, Standford University did research into why this is. According to neuroscientist Bob Dougherty, \"The right patterns of ink on a page can create vivid mental imagery and instill powerful emotions.\" Your brain does amazing things while you’re reading, the breadth of which researchers are still defining. And by placing yourself into the world of a great novel, you are given the chance to experience something new that could be informative in your interactions with other people. This compassion was notably detected in children reading Harry Potter. Another experiment \"conducted three studies to test whether extended contact through reading the popular best-selling books of Harry Potter improves attitudes toward stigmatized groups (immigrants, homosexuals, refugees).\" The conclusion of the study was that children who identified with Harry as a character reacted to his sympathy for marginalized groups (such as \"mudbloods\") by becoming more sympathetic towards similar groups in contemporary society (such as the LGBT and immigrant communities). But this was only shown after these connections were explicated to the children and only if they identified with Harry. What does this all mean? Sure, we create images in our heads of the stories we read –we engage with language, we sympathize with the characters in our books– but besides Harry Potter, which books should we be reading to maximize these cognitive benefits? The authors of another study, David Comer Kidd and Emanuele Castano, tackled this question, but also asserted that what you choose read is important! As Castano explained to Mic.com: \"We believe that one critical difference between lit and pop fiction is the extent to which the characters are complex, ambiguous, difficult to get to know, etc. (in other words, human) versus stereotyped, simple...\" Through their research, they found that readers of literary fiction receive more of the empathetic benefits of reading than those who read pop-fiction or non-fiction. The term \"literary fiction\" seems arbitrary, but Kidd and Castano explain that literary fiction merely denotes the level of complexity in stories and their characters (at least, that’s what it means in the context of their study). In 50 Shades Of Grey, for example, the characters are laid out. They react to each other and to their environment. By no means are these characters simple or easy, but they do not evoke the same complicated and uncanny feelings that one experiences with Nick Carraway as he narrates The Great Gatsby. Reading in general helps with empathy, but literary reading amplifies this effect. By reading a challenging book, you’re not only becoming a smarter person, you’re also become more empathetic. Literature is not always easy, but by attempting to tackle harder books, we create new connections in our minds that we might not have otherwise. Like opening a window to let fresh air into your home, literature opens up our minds to the myriad ideas that we wouldn’t be able to experience on our own! So after you finish your magazine or paperback thriller, reflect on its contents. Take a moment to analyze the experiences depicted as if they were your own. And in choosing your next book, make it a tough one. Your brain will thank you. Which book inspires you the most?', 'text_b': None, 'label': True},\n",

Valve’s announcement implied that Steam users should retrieve item skins from gambling websites, and some members of the community began to wonder: would Valve’s action trigger a crash of CS:GO’s skin market? Some Steam users own hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of CS:GO skins. How would their fortunes, and the inventory value of CS:GO’s other 10 million active players, be affected by this announcement? Not much. Although there isn’t an index number that reflects the value of the CS:GO item market as a whole, sales data for individual weapons tend to show an initial reaction to the news, followed by normalization. Valve’s announcement went out via email just before 1 PM Pacific on June 13. I sampled a set of 20 arbitrary, higher-volume skins on the market, and found that they fell an average of 13.7% that evening. A Minimum Wear AWP BOOM skin, for example, dropped from $21.75 to $18.56 12 hours after the announcement. The drop in price seems reactionary, a reflection of some sellers’ fear that the market would implode. Although the correction was very uniform across the items I sampled, most items have not continued to drop in value, and many have risen back to their pre-announcement price. More adjustments can probably be expected as gambling websites close or alter how they operate, but my belief is that these items will retain most of their value as long as CS:GO remains one of the most-played and most-spectated games in the world.', 'text_b': None, 'label': True},\n",

However, the consequences of objectification to society are far from positive, and side effects among women include body shame, depression, eating disorders, low self-esteem and even decreased sexual pleasure, according to Heldman: Instead of being involved and engaged in what is happening, you tend to view yourself from a third-party perspective. A spectator\\'s perspective, where you\\'re worried about rolls of fat hanging out, what that leg looks like... it gets in the way of sexual pleasure. So if there\\'s anything I can pitch to you about why you don\\'t want to live in a culture that sexually objectifies: it diminishes your sexual pleasure.

It comes almost a year after the shocking suicide of a vet overwhelmed by grief at the plight of stray animals. The BBC\\'s Cindy Sui explores this tragedy. Perhaps veterinarian and animal lover Chien Chih-cheng was in the wrong job at the wrong time. \"She often worked overtime, rarely took a proper lunch break, and sacrificed her holidays to give the dogs more attention and make their lives better,\" Winnie Lai, her colleague at a shelter for abandoned dogs in Taoyuan City, remembers. As a graduate of Taiwan\\'s top university with the highest score in a civil service examination, Ms Chien could have chosen a desk job at head office, but opted to personally care for the many pets abandoned each year in Taiwan. The shelter\\'s lobby was decorated with pictures of animals drawn by Ms Chien to encourage adoptions, but many of them were destined to be put down. On 5 May last year, Ms Chien took her own life, using the same drug she used to put down animals. She said she wanted to help people understand what happens to strays in Taiwan. Taiwan was gripped by anger and soul-searching in the weeks that followed, most of it focused on a life tragically cut short. But people also asked why frontline workers in Taiwan\\'s battle against pet abandonment were being put under so much pressure. You might also be interested in In an interview Ms Chien once did with a local TV station CTI, she described the first time she saw an animal put down. \"I went home and cried all night,\" she said. But it was media appearances like this that meant she came under personal attack. When it was revealed she had put down 700 dogs in two years, she was labelled the \"beautiful slaughterer\". Shelter workers dreaded putting down the dogs, but Ms Chien and others saw this as a better end for the unwanted, ageing or difficult-to-adopt animals than leaving them at risk of disease in overcrowded shelters. \"They called her a butcher... We are frequently scolded. Some people say we\\'ll go to hell. They say we love to kill and are cruel,\" said Kao Yu-jie, one of her co-workers. \"But people still abandon their dogs. You hear all kinds of reasons: their dog is too mean, or not mean enough, barks too much, or doesn\\'t bark enough.\" High kill rate Taiwan has two main problems when it comes to animal welfare: the number of pets being abandoned and the number of strays allowed to reproduce. In reality, the situation has improved over the past decade thanks to increased public awareness and efforts by shelters and activists to discourage abandonment and encourage adoptions. But the number of animals put down remains high and shelters are still underfunded and understaffed. The work is difficult and hours long. In some shelters, half the animals are killed. In 2015 around 10,900 were put down. And about 8,600 shelter animals died last year from other causes, such as illness. In the CTI interview, Ms Chien described the process of putting a dog down. \"We first let it take a stroll and eat some snacks and talk to it. Then we take it into the \\'humane room\\'. \"When you put it on the table, it\\'s very scared and its whole body is shaking. But after we administer the drug, it leaves in three to five seconds. It no longer shakes. Actually, it\\'s very sad.\" No psychological counselling was provided for the staff. Psychological support in this and other fields is practically unheard of in Taiwan. The Taoyuan shelter actually had one of the lowest euthanasia rates and highest adoption rates of any shelter. But a letter Ms Chien left behind when she killed herself suggested her concern for the welfare of the animals had consumed her. Her colleagues attest to this, although experts remind us that many and complex factors lie behind any suicide. \"She put herself under a lot of pressure. She cared a lot about the animals and the pressure from the work affected her,\" said Ms Lai. In the letter, Ms Chien wrote: \"I hope my departure will let all of you know stray animals are also life. I hope the government knows the importance of controlling the source [of the problem]... Please value life.\" The irony of her exhortation to value life was not lost on observers and blame was quick to be handed out. Newspapers accused the government of \"murdering\" her, with many saying it failed to come up with effective ways to stamp out pet abandonment or prevent strays from reproducing. Some accused \"higher-level bureaucrats\" of trying to convince the public that Ms Chien simply couldn\\'t handle her work pressures. But other commentators said that while shelter workers were easy to target, all of society must take responsibility. Many believe the root of the problem is the insufficient enforcement of a neutering and spaying law. The chief of the animal protection section of the Council of Agriculture, Chiang Wen-chuan, said a law requiring spaying and neutering only recently came into effect, and doesn\\'t allow staff to impose fines immediately. And even though staff pay visits to the owners of 60,000 animals each year to urge them to follow the laws, only 30% of the island\\'s 1.7 million dogs have been spayed or neutered. \"We are very short-staffed. All of Taiwan only has 140 animal protection staff,\" said Mr Chiang. \"It\\'s a systematic problem. Ending euthanasia and expanding shelters and staff will not solve the problem.\" Some Taiwanese also believe such medical procedures change the personality of their pets. Others want to breed to give to friends or sell. Short-term measures Ms Chien already knew, when she died, that a new law was coming into force. From 4 February 2017, it will be illegal to put down abandoned animals. Budgets have also increased by 40%, there will be more inspectors and now anybody who wishes to abandon their pet at a shelter will have to pay a fee as high as $125 (£100). The authorities say this is nothing to do with Ms Chien\\'s suicide, and her story, which was simply a human tragedy. The government has pledged to increase funding and staffing at shelters and provide psychological counselling. But many see these as short-term measures. Activists want the government to crack down on breeders, implement subsidies for NGOs to spay and neuter, and provide assistance to groups that take in strays. Perhaps Ms Chien was not the catalyst for the changes, but her love for animals will not be forgotten by her husband, also an animal control worker, and her colleagues - all of whom were left pain-stricken by her death.', 'text_b': None, 'label': False},\n",

The conclusion of Star Wars: The Force Awakens left us all with one question: Who are Rey\\'s parents? While many people believed the final shot was a clue to Rey being a Skywalker, there were just as many theories that she was a Kenobi, or someone totally unrelated to previous characters from the series. But a new theory has awakened: that Rey is in fact Emperor Palpatine\\'s granddaughter. YouTuber Vincent Vendetta uploaded a video compiling the evidence to support this theory, and honestly it\\'s pretty compelling. There\\'s the matter of their fighting styles. Both Rey and Palpatine are the only two characters in the Star Wars universe who use this forward-thrust move. This mirroring is equally powerful when you realise the first move we see each of them perform is this forward thrust. Rey\\'s first lightsaber battle has several other visual references to Palpatine\\'s fighting style, almost too many to be coincidental. This cyclical referencing also works in the sense that the earlier films have followed a pattern of Skywalker vs Palpatine tension. In The Force Awakens, if Rey\\'s parentage does stem from Palpatine, her battle against Kylo Ren continues the Skywalker/Palpatine tension, flipping the dark and light sides. For now. That\\'s because Rey is already struggling with the pull of the dark side. While every fledgling Jedi struggles between the pull of light and dark, there are moments during The Force Awakens that point to Rey being tempted to the dark. In the film\\'s script, it describes Rey as \"standing on the edge of the dark side\". During Rey\\'s vision, Palpatine can be heard several times. Right before the hallway collapses on her, you can hear Palpatine\\'s scream, and further along, there\\'s audio of Palpatine saying \"any Jedi\". There are a few other audio snippets included (Luke, Obi-Wan, and Yoda to name a few) but Palpatine\\'s inclusion seems like an outlier when you consider Luke\\'s lightsaber is the trigger for the vision. Why else would ol\\' Palps show up, if not because of some kind of relationship to Rey? The notion of hiding in plain sight comes into play when you consider the poster for The Force Awakens. In the portrait form, Rey\\'s strategic placement puts her between the dark and light sides in the most literal sense. But when expanded out, Rey is placed toward the dark side, hanging with Kylo Ren, her staff aligned with his lightsaber to almost seem as if they\\'re one. Finally, what about the accent? A lot of people used Rey\\'s British accent as evidence that she could be a Kenobi, but guess who else had a fancy posh accent. Yep. Palpatine. There\\'s even more compelling evidence when you take into account clues from the film\\'s script, the accompanying novel, and other hints from the film.', 'text_b': None, 'label': False},\n",

We’re good at something! Turns out, according to the second annual TD Bank Love and Money Study, millennials are better at handling their money and talking about it with their partners. The study says that 74% of millennial couples talk about their money weekly, and that those who do report higher levels of satisfaction and happiness in their relationships. This is very important, because as many relationship articles will tell you, money and talking about money is one of the highest stressors in relationships, which makes sense. Whether we like it or not, money affects our everyday lives, from where we live to what we eat. It’s hard to keep the romance alive if you’re feeling stressed out about money and you’re afraid of talking to your partner about something that affects the both of you so closely. The fact that millennials are good at this feels weirdly like a no-brainer. Though other generations will often disparage millennials for being too sensitive and open about their feelings, it seems like the benefit of this is millennials are more likely to be transparent and not shy away from tough relationship conversations. The survey included 1,902 adults, and included couples of all ages to see how different age groups talked about their money matters. Most of the couples classified themselves as \"married\" or \"committed.\" Millennials were classified as participants who were 18-34 years old. Among this group, couples were found to be much happier on average than the other demographics, with 49% of the millennial couples saying that they’re \"extremely happy\" with their \"soulmate.\" Awww! Of course, this survey isn’t a blanket statement about any particular generation or couple, and every individual and couple has their own challenges to face, but it is still awesome to see something positive being said about the millennial age group.

Originally, all humans had brown eyes, although genetic variation relating to a gene called OCA2 resulted in changes to the amount of pigment produced by different individuals, resulting in the emergence of different shades of brown. Armed with this information, scientists had for many years searched for the source of blue eyes on the OCA2 gene, but without success. More recently, a mutation to a separate, nearby gene called HERC2 has been identified as the cause of blue eyes. This alteration switches off OCA2, the gene that determines the amount of the brown pigment melanin that we make. It is thought to have first occurred when humans began to migrate from Africa to Europe, meaning that every person with blue eyes is a descendent of a single early European. The fact that every blue-eyed person alive today has this same mutation is pretty compelling evidence for this theory, although the identity of the initial mutant remains something of a mystery. To date, the earliest set of sapphire-colored peepers ever found belong to a 7,000-year-old skeleton that was discovered in northern Spain.

(If you don't agree, I'm sorry, but I don't understand you.) Now, scientists have gone and done something incredibly cool—they figured out a new way to cook the grain that could cut its calories in half...or more. New research was presented at the 249th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society, and revealed that adding a teaspoon of coconut oil to boiling water with a half-cup of non-fortified white rice, letting it simmer for 20 to 40 minutes, then refrigerating it for 12 hours may reduce the number of calories your body takes in by 50 to 60 percent. Like I said: Seriously cool. The researchers explained that rice contains two kinds of starch—one that is easily digestible, and one that's resistant. Our bodies don't have the enzymes needed to digest the resistant kind, which means it can't break down that starch and transform it into the sugar that typically gets absorbed into the bloodstream. If you have extra sugar in your bloodstream, that gets turned into fat, which we know is no good. In other words, the scientists wanted to find a way to get the rice to have more resistant starch, rather than digestible ones, to avoid that extra sugar in the body. This is where the coconut oil comes in. Adding it to the cooking process makes the starch granules resistant to the action of digestive enzymes, and then letting the rice cool for 12 hours pushes the process along. Translation: Same amount of rice, fewer calories into the body. Bonus: You don't have to eat the rice cold to get the desired effect. Reheating it the next day won't affect results, the researchers found. No word yet on whether it works on brown rice, or if other oils will do the same thing, but more testing will be done to figure all that good stuff out. For now, we'll just continue to sing the praises of coconut oil as we dig in to a bowl of rice totally guilt-free.\", 'text_b': None, 'label': False},\n",

Aaron Judge\\'s blasts go a long wayBOSTON -- When Aaron Judge was last a normal-sized human being, at about 9 or 10 years old, the player who made him run to his television was Barry Bonds. Judge grew up in Linden, California, about two hours from what was then Pac Bell Park. \"I was a Giants fan and that was the time he was putting up 70 homers a year,\" said Judge, who\\'s now a 6-foot-7, 282-pound right fielder for the New York Yankees. \"That was pretty impressive to watch as a kid.\" On Wednesday, Judge will celebrate his 25th birthday by playing his first game in the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry. He will step to the plate as a rookie sensation; his six homers are tied for the second most in the American League. But it\\'s not just about how many balls he has hit over the fence -- it\\'s how far he has hit them. Judge is challenging the current champ, Giancarlo Stanton, as the king of the XXXL home run. Judge’s 460-foot homer on Saturday in Pittsburgh was the third longest for a Yankee since ESPN started tracking distances in 2009. Only Alex Rodriguez\\'s 477-foot homer in August 2015 and Juan Miranda\\'s 469-foot shot in October 2009 traveled farther. In the past two seasons, Judge has three of the four longest Yankee homers. Only Chase Headley, with a 453-footer in July 2016, cracks the top four. Headley believes he got all of that one, but he said he and his teammates are eager to see what would happen if everything clicks in perfectly for Judge. \"We are all just waiting for that time where everything just syncs up and he gets every bit of it,\" Headley said. \"I want to see him do that. He is just a humongous human being that has out-of-this-world power. Five hundred fifty feet is not out of the question. If there is nothing in the way, he is hitting it 550.\" Starlin Castro, who is usually in the same batting practice group as Judge, has never been big on watching teammates or opponents take BP. He remembers being around Stanton in the Arizona Fall League in 2009 and taking a few glances, but besides that, Castro said he has never been much of a gawker -- until now. \"He is the first guy,\" Castro said. \"I’m really happy we are in the same group. It is really motivating. It is really fun to watch. We feel like every swing he takes, something big is going to happen.\" Matt Holliday, on the other hand, has always studied standout teammates and opponents in BP as if there\\'d be an exam afterward. It\\'s not just tape-measure specialists, but contact guys too. Holliday looks for any little ingredient he can add to his game, making the 37-year-old slugger as qualified as anyone to weigh in on Judge’s power. \"We are all just waiting for that time where everything just syncs up and he gets every bit of it ... I want to see him do that. He is just a humongous human being that has out-of-this-world power. Five-hundred fifty feet is not out of the question. If there is nothing in the way, he is hitting it 550.\" \"There aren’t many guys that can hit the ball as far as him in batting practice, if any,\" Holliday said. \"Obviously, Stanton is the easy one that comes to mind that I’ve played against. Barry Bonds, too.\" Holliday has seen Stanton do his damage only as an opponent, while he receives a daily dose of Judge. He said it might just be familiarity, but he would take Judge in a distance contest. Mark Teixeira, who just completed a 14-year career in which he swatted 409 homers, said he used to watch Nelson Cruz launch some balls in the Arlington heat when they were teammates in Texas. In 2013, Teixeira played with Stanton in the World Baseball Classic. \"Judge’s power is right there with those two guys,\" said Teixeira, now an ESPN analyst. In 2016, Judge struck out in 42 of his 84 at-bats, a performance so bad it made the Yankees hesitant to hand him the right-field job in spring training, even with a full winter endorsement from team owner Hal Steinbrenner. In the final days, the Yankees finally gave Judge the nod over Aaron Hicks. Judge has struck out 17 times in 61 at-bats thus far. \"I knew it was going to take some time for him to get used to minor league pitching and big league pitching and really grow into his swing, because he is a big guy and he has to grow into his strike zone,\" Teixeira said. \"The smarter he has gotten about swinging at certain pitches and the more ready he is at the plate, he looks like he is so dangerous right now. He is exactly where you would hope he would be when I saw him a few years ago.\" It\\'s early, but Judge has joined Stanton as a player you can’t miss. His power, like Bonds in his prime, makes it nearly impossible to look away. He\\'s the type of player little kids will be running to their televisions to see.', 'text_b': None, 'label': True},\n",

(*) Maybe my favorite section of the book – and the favorite of many of the early reviewers – is called The Great Debate, where Matt and I argue out what should get the top pick after we initially wound up with a five-way tie for first place. Included below is the essay I wrote about a little show called Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which finished in a tie for 25th place – alongside, appropriately enough, fellow classic high school dramas Freaks and Geeks and My So-Called Life – among our Pantheon of series, coming up just as soon as I get the mustard out... Buffy the Vampire Slayer (WB, 1997–2001; UPN, 2001–2003) Total score: 94 TV show titles rarely bring viewers into the tent, but they can keep them out. If you want to give your charming blended-family comedy an ironic name like Trophy Wife, don\"t be surprised if your target demographic takes it literally and stays far away. (See also Terriers, Selfie, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...) Now, Buffy the Vampire Slayer ran seven seasons, was never in danger of cancellation at any point (it jumped networks after season 5 only because UPN was looking to steal a hit from its rival the WB), launched a long-running (and, eventually, very good) spin-off in Angel, was beloved by its fans, and helped define the identity of an entire TV network for the short but memorable existence of the WB. By any standard you want to measure, Buffy was a success. Except maybe this one: If you tell someone who\"s never watched it that a show called Buffy the Vampire Slayer is among the best TV dramas of all time, they will roll their eyes at you and change the subject to something less divisive, like immigration policy. Would a Buffy the Vampire Slayer by any other name have been a crossover hit rather than a cult classic, or won more awards, or simply have been an easier sell to non-fans? Certainly, you can imagine WB executives thinking that, which is why they briefly tried to get Joss Whedon to shorten the title to just Slayer. Whedon held firm, and not just because it might have created confusion between the show and the thrash band that brought the world songs like \"Reign in Blood\" and \"Mandatory Suicide.\" He knew that Buffy the Vampire Slayer was the perfect title for his series, because it captured the exact spirit of what he was planning to make. You could give it a more serious or distinguished title, but no matter the packaging, the show inside would be about a vapid teenage girl, Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), who discovered that her destiny was to protect humankind from vampires, demons, and other creatures of the underworld, and a show whose tone shifted rapidly between horror, melodrama, action, and pure comedy. The name tells you all of that, and suggests that if you\"re turned off by it, you\"re probably not going to like the series to which it\"s applied. It was a tonal balance that director Fran Rubel Kuzui didn\"t even bother attempting with the campy Buffy movie adapted from Whedon\"s first script. The show, though, would have room for many different emotions, all juggled expertly by Gellar, Anthony Stewart Head, Alyson Hannigan, and the rest of the cast. It was a series made cheaply even by the standards of TV\"s fifth-place network, but it almost never seemed ridiculous despite the primitive effects and awkward stunt-doubling for Gellar. If it wanted to make you laugh at a bit of witty banter (\"I laugh in the face of danger. Then I hide until it goes away.\"), it could. If it wanted its latest monster to creep you out, it found the most disturbing context possible. And if it wanted to make you cry, it was pointless to try fighting it. If anything, the exaggerated nature of the various undead villains only made the high school setting more effective, because what is adolescence if not a time when every problem gets blown wildly out of proportion? In the real world, a girl whose boyfriend started treating her badly after they finally have sex wouldn\"t need to worry that he had turned pure evil, as happened with Buffy and her vampire love interest Angel (David Boreanaz), but it might feel that way for a while. And a real teen boy going through the changes of puberty might occasionally imagine himself a monster, but laconic guitar player Oz (Seth Green) actually transformed into a werewolf every time the moon was full. Turning monsters into metaphors for teenage emotional turmoil was a clever gambit, and one that played particularly well during the show\"s three seasons set in high school. Buffy is (by our rankings, anyway) one of the best TV shows ever set in high school, but it wasn\"t entirely immune to the same problems that eventually beset all such shows when their characters head to college. Even so, those later seasons still had a knack for landing on the right parallel between the supernatural and the universal, like Buffy\"s little sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) literally being put on earth to cause her problems (which in this case involved the literal end of the world). (Those later years also offered some thrilling formal experiments, including \"Hush,\" an homage to silent horror movies, involving demons who rob people of the ability to speak or scream; \"The Body,\" a stripped-down outing where Buffy confronts the mundane reality of her mother\"s death from natural causes; and the musical episode \"Once More, with Feeling,\" where a curse forces everyone to express their feelings through song.) Back to that title. Whedon once suggested to the New York Times, \"If I made Buffy the Lesbian Separatist, a series of lectures on PBS on why there should be feminism, no one would be coming to the party, and it would be boring. The idea of changing culture is important to me, and it can only be done in a popular medium.\" Whedon didn\"t invent feminism in TV storytelling, or even the idea of cross-pollinating it with fantasy and sci-fi tropes. (For much of its run, Buffy overlapped with Xena: Warrior Princess.) But he created one of the finest examples of it, and wrapped it up in a wildly entertaining package that included a name that may have made some potential viewers roll their eyes, but that made enough of them smile and think this might just be a show for them.

Playing on her own let her imagination soar. As a child, Ashley Thomas loved to go, by herself, to a meadow about a 10-minute walk from her house in Ojai, California. Ah, the old-time memories of the days when kids could play on their own without someone posting a video online to shame their parents, or calling the police to have mom arrested and the children seized by social services! Only in the past decade or so has \"no child left alone\" become the social and legal norm in the U.S. A doctoral student in cognitive science at the University of California at Irvine, Thomas is the lead author of a recently published study designed to understand what’s going on. After all, under most circumstances, the objective risk to children left by themselves is extremely low. The chances that a stranger will abduct and kill or not return a child, the great fear driving the new norm, is about 0.00007 per cent or one in 1.4 million annually. It’s much more dangerous to drive a child somewhere, or even to walk with one across a parking lot, than to leave a kid alone in a well-ventilated car. News reports and crime shows feed exaggerated fears. Thomas and her co-authors note that legal norms needn’t follow inaccurate beliefs about risks. \"The fact that many people irrationally fear air travel does not result in air travel being criminalized,\" they write. \"Parents are not arrested for bringing their children with them on airplanes. \"In contrast, parents are arrested and prosecuted for allowing their children to wait in cars, play in parks, or walk through their neighbourhoods without an adult,\" they note. Indeed, parents safely make decisions every day without thinking about other tiny risks. \"When you decide to park your car in a parking lot you don’t look up at the roof to see if a sniper could hit you,\" Thomas says. You don’t think about whether the store you’re taking your child into might get held up. Nor should you. Yet leaving your kid alone, even for a short time in safe circumstances, can lead to a child-abuse investigation. What’s going on? The researchers suspected that the overestimating of risk reflects moral convictions about proper parenting. To separate the two instincts, they created a series of surveys asking participants to rate the danger to children left alone in five specific circumstances: a 2 1⁄2-year-old at home for 20 minutes eating a snack and watching Frozen , for instance, or a 6-year-old in a park about a mile from her house for 25 minutes. The reasons for the parent’s absence were varied randomly. It could be unintentional, for work, to volunteer for charity, to relax or to meet an illicit lover. Because the child’s situation was exactly the same in all the intentional cases, the risks should also be identical. Asked what the dangers might be, participants listed the same ones in all circumstances, with a stranger harming the child the most common, followed by an accident. The unintentional case might be slightly more dangerous, because parents wouldn’t have a chance to make provisions for their absence such as giving the child a phone and emergency instructions or parking the car in the shade. But survey respondents didn’t see things this way at all. \"A mother’s unintentional absence was seen as safer for the child than a mother’s intentional absence for any reason, and a mother’s work-related absence was seen as more dangerous than an unintentional absence, but less dangerous than if the mother left to pursue an illicit sexual affair,\" they write. The same was true for fathers, except that respondents rated leaving for work as posing no greater danger than leaving unintentionally. Moral disapproval informed beliefs about risks. That was true even when the survey explicitly separated the two factors, first asking participants to rate leaving the child from 1 (nothing wrong) to 10 (highly unethical/immoral). People rated the risk higher when they first made a moral judgment. \"People don’t only think that leaving children alone is dangerous and therefore immoral,\" the researchers write. \"They also think it is immoral and therefore dangerous. \"That is, people overestimate the actual danger to children who are left alone by their parents, in order to better support or justify their moral condemnation of parents who do so.\" The result is a feedback loop that increases the legal and social penalties for leaving kids alone and reinforces the belief that even the briefest parental absence amounts to child abuse. These beliefs don’t just affect busybodies. They lead police, prosecutors, judges and jurors to overestimate risks. Take what happened to Julie Koehler: she left her three daughters, ages 8, 5 and 4, watching a video in the minivan while she went into an Evanston, Illinois, Starbucks for three minutes.

He’s the CEO and founder of SunShare, a company that installs community gardens of solar panels so even those unable to have a solar panel on their roof can access solar power. One word to describe how he sees the energy industry of the future is \"choice.\" \"What we’re starting to see is this shift toward consumer preferences actually being an important factor in this industry for the first time,\" says David. \"It’s as simple as the product we’re bringing to customers, which is giving people the power to choose where they want to get their energy.\" SunShare started in Colorado with a two-acre project, and has now spread to Minnesota and New York. The gardens range in size from one megawatt to five megawatts, and cover between six and 30 acres of land. Local utility companies purchase energy from the solar garden, and then community members subscribe to the solar garden and receive solar credits on their utility bill. \"We think we can change the energy industry because demand for a type of power has never really driven the electricity industry in this country. What you had was more supply side determinations based on regulatory processes and monopoly utilities,\" says David. \"Our hypothesis and what we’ve proven is that people will change, and people making choices with their pocketbooks drives change. Solar energy is beating the costs of natural gas plants across the country right now, even the operating costs, and that’s not even including the volatility premium you’d have to price in to a natural gas plant you’d be building for 20 years. You’ve got the economic plus the environmental benefits that really make solar a win-win for both utilities and consumers.\" Yet change is not always easy, and David has had to work against systems that have been in place for a century as he pioneers a new way of providing power. \"The challenges are working with utilities that aren’t really built for this new operating system that comes with the renewable and distributed energy infrastructure, so having solar and wind farms around the country near the source of where people are consuming energy. That’s not how this country has looked at consuming energy previously. You’re basically going from one of those old DOS operating systems to Windows XP. It’s a completely different experience,\" he says. \"That’s really what we’re talking about in terms of the difference in how energy is transferred across the grid, managed across the grid, consumed across the grid, and tracked across the grid. It’s that much of a difference. So you’re working with this industry that’s built on a DOS platform with DOS economics. Changing that mindset is probably one of the biggest challenges, but economics are driving that; it’s a powerful force.\" As he pursues making solar power affordable and available, he’s at a unique vantage point to predict how the energy industry will ultimately change. In addition to the choices available to people, David predicts it will be easier for utility companies to monitor their energy output. \"I think you’re going to be able to track energy usage so that you can much more closely match energy production to energy demand. Previously power plants might be operating consistently 24 hours a day because they really can’t be shut off. You can’t just turn off a coal-fired power plant for four hours in a day. You end up burning a lot more energy, a lot more coal, for example, at nighttime than is actually being used on the system,\" he says. \"So you’ll see a lot less waste in the system, which overall will significantly reduce our energy consumption as a country.\" Energy of the future will also be more reliable and secure. \"It’s going to be terrorist-proof: you’re not going to have single points of weakness on the system where terrorists can disrupt our access to electricity. By that, I mean localized, renewable energy creates backup support systems on the grid that don’t fail with natural disasters or terrorism,\" says David.', 'text_b': None, 'label': False},\n",

When the farmer decided to turn the stone over, he uncovered something he could’ve never imagined. At first the farmer thought he had uncovered a house, but no, it was so much more. The farmer had uncovered the lost and hidden city of Skara Brae. This city, found on the island of Orkney, has a rich history behind it as one of the oldest settlements ever recorded in Great Britain. This lost city of Skara Brae is believed to be over 5,000 years old. That would mean that this city would be older than any pyramid found in Egypt! Because the entire city became covered in sand dunes, most of the city was preserved very well. At the peak of the city’s existence, historians believe that the city held close to 50 to 100 people.

We’re now living in the Anthropocene Era - where human activity is the primary driver of change to the environment. The impact of capitalist and heavily industrialised societies is equivalent to how an asteroid would impact the planet. An equation aids in creating a manifestation of the risks of climate change through large-scale and widespread alterations to the planet. Owen Gaffney and Will Stephen of Australian National University drew up the equation, which was published in The Anthropocene Review journal, by homing in on the rate of change of Earth’s life support system including the atmosphere, oceans, forests, waterway, ice sheets and other diverse limbs of the planet. Owen Gaffney wrote in the New Scientist, \"For four billion years, the rate of change of the Earth system (E) has been a complex function of astronomical (A) and geophysical (G) forces plus internal dynamics (I): Earth’s orbit around the sun, gravitational interactions with other planets, the sun’s heat output, colliding continents, volcanoes and evolution, among others.\" He added, \"In the equation, astronomical and geophysical forces tend to zero because of their slow nature or rarity, as do internal dynamics, for now. All these forces still exert pressure, but currently on orders of magnitude less than human impact.\" Steffen says that these forces have changed our natural environment at a rate of 0.01 degrees Celsius per century. However, greenhouse gases as a result of human activity over the past 45 years \"have increased the rate of temperature rise to 1.7 degrees Celsius per century, dwarfing the natural background rate\". According to the two authors, these figures represent a change that is 170 times faster than natural forces. \"We are not saying the astronomical forces of our solar system or geological processes have disappeared, but in terms of their impact in such a short period of time they are now negligible compared with our own influence,\" Steffen said. \"Crystallising this evidence in the form of a simple equation gives the current situation a clarity that the wealth of data often dilutes. \"What we do is give a very specific number to show how humans are affecting the earth over a short timeframe. It shows that while other forces operate over millions of years, we as humans are having an impact at the same strength as the many of these other forces, but in the timeframe of just a couple of centuries. \"The human magnitude of climate change looks more like a meteorite strike than a gradual change.\" Planet Earth, they wrote, has proved its resilience beyond doubt as it has for millions of years withstood human meddling with the environment’s most natural state of flux. Having said that, homo sapiens have now reached an era where if we fail to reduce the impact of our activities, then climate change could \"trigger societal collapse\", their research concluded. just in', 'text_b': None, 'label': True},\n",

That Hanks, a two-time Best Actor winner and five-time nominee, is at his very best before the key sequence in Paul Greengrass\\' new film should provide Oscar prognosticators with all they need to know about the 57-year-old actor\\'s awards chances. \"Captain Phillips\" is set to open the 2013 New York Film Festival, but Sony and producer Scott Rudin set up screenings this week for critics and journalists to see the film while all eyes are fixed on Toronto. Thus far, the move paid off: reviews have been solid, with some (In Contention editor Kris Tapley, HuffPost Entertainment\\'s own Mike Ryan) more infatuated with the film than others (Variety critic Scott Foundas, The Wrap critic Alonso Duralde). Heed the words from the former camp: \"Captain Phillips\" stands at the very top of the recent spate of thinking-persons\\' action films from the last few years, on par with Kathryn Bigelow\\'s \"Zero Dark Thirty\" and well ahead of Ben Affleck\\'s Best Picture-winning \"Argo.\" The reason is Hanks, who gives the type of performance everyone has wanted to see from Tom Hanks since the early 2000s. His Richard Phillips is not the most emotional of men: an opening scene with his wife (played very briefly but beautifully by Catherine Keener) establishes him as the kind of thoughtful, quiet type who one can assume watches the History Channel and likes Tommy Lee Jones movies. Yet as Greengrass keeps turning the screws on Phillips and his situation, that cool demeanor begins to crack, shatter and, later, turn to dust. Hanks is put through the ringer -- Greengrass\\' closed-quarters camera work keeps in him the action even as things get impossibly physical -- and the results are breathtaking. Like the best acting, Hanks\\' performance actually feels real. By the end of the film, it\\'s hard to tell where Hanks ends and Phillips begins. This is the time of year when a new Oscar front-runner debuts almost every day (\"Gravity\" and \"12 Years A Slave\" reached the top of the line after raves last week). Yet \"Captain Phillips\" belongs in those whispered early awards musings, not just for Hanks and Greengrass (a previous nominee for \"United 93,\" a film that bears similarities to \"Captain Phillips\" in structure and form), but for Best Editing (Christopher Rouse), Best Cinematography (Barry Ackroyd), Best Adapted Screenplay (Billy Ray) and, if a wave of support carries the film to multiple nominations, perhaps Best Supporting Actor for Barkhad Abdi. The newcomer plays Muse, the lead Somali pirate in the film, a relatively decent man turned to evil behavior by his standing in life. Abdi (and Barkhad Addirahman, Faysal Ahmed, Mahat M. Ali as the other pirates) helps keep the film from ever truly demonizing Phillips\\' kidnappers, an easy pitfall that Greengrass deftly avoids. The problem is that Abdi doesn\\'t have an easy road to Supporting Actor: the category is as loaded as usual, with actors like Daniel Bruhl (for \"Rush\"), Michael Fassbender (for \"12 Years A Slave\"), Josh Brolin (for \"Labor Day\"), Steve Coogan (for \"Philomena\"), Bradley Cooper (for \"American Hustle\") and even Hanks (for \"Saving Mr. Banks\") potentially standing in his way. That, however, is back-room chatter for another day. For now, just know that \"Captain Phillips\" is one of those truly terrific movies that everyone hopes to see in the fall. It\\'s riveting filmmaking. \"Captain Phillips\" opens on Oct. 11.', 'text_b': None, 'label': True},\n",

We were talking about how excited we were to attend an upcoming wedding in Kalamazoo (where we met and went to college) and discussing what would be the perfect gift for the newlyweds. So, I thought back to our wedding day (nearly 9 years ago) and tried to recall the gifts that had meant the most to me. The funny thing? The gift that meant the very most was still sitting in a closet... ... unopened. On our wedding day, my husband Brandon and I received a gift from my Great Aunt Alison. On the plain white box was a card that read, \"Do not open until your 1st disagreement.\" Now, there had obviously been plenty of disagreements, arguments and slammed doors throughout our 9 years. There were even a couple of instances where we both considered giving up... but we never opened the box. I honestly think that we both avoided turning to the box, because it would have symbolized our failure. To us, it would have meant that we didn’t have what it takes to make our marriage work – and we’re both too stubborn and determined for that. So, it forced us to reassess situations. Was it really time to open the box? What if this isn’t our worst fight? What if there’s a worse one ahead of us and we don’t have our box?!? As my Great Uncle Bill would say, \\'Nothing is ever so bad that it couldn’t get worse.\\' All along, we assumed that the contents of that box held the key to saving a marriage – an age old trick – unbeknownst to us rookies. After all, my Great Aunt and Uncle had been married for nearly half a century. So, we thought the box would save \"us\" – and in a way it did. That box went beyond what I believe my Great Aunt had intended. It was by far the greatest wedding gift of all. For 9 years (and three moves) that box sat high on a shelf in various closets gathering dust, yet it somehow taught us about tolerance, understanding, compromise and patience. Our marriage strengthened as we became best friends, partners, and teammates. Today, we decided to open that box, because I finally had a realization.

The note to Kathy told her to buy pizza (\"or something you both like\") and prepare a bath, and the note to Brandon said, \"Go get flowers and a bottle of wine.\"In the end, Kathy wrote that they had been enjoying this gift for almost a decade, even though the box – which she calls \"the greatest wedding gift of all\" – hadn\\'t been opened.\"I realized that the tools for creating a strong, healthy marriage were never within that box – they were within us.\"In an interview with PEOPLE, Kathy opened up about how their story has inspired other couples.\"My husband and I are in awe of how much attention this story has garnered,\" she says. \"I had only intended to give credit to my great aunt and share how important the box was for my husband and I – and the lessons that it had inadvertently taught us. Now that our story has gotten so much attention and has inspired others, it seems to be the gift that keeps on giving!\"As for her wise great aunt, Kathy says, \"She is just tickled by how much attention this has gotten – how many people have shared that they wish they had an \\'Aunt Alison\\' and those that think her gift was absolutely genius. She didn\\'t realize just how special the gift was to us until a number of years after our wedding when she found out that we hadn’t opened it yet.\"Aunt Alison was surprised that we kept it for nine years, then the lessons it taught us – inadvertently – and now she’s even more surprised at the response our story has received.\"And when it comes to their best advice to other couples when it comes to handling disagreements, she says, \"For the little things, learn how to disagree and move on.

A scientist, though, would phrase the same question in an almost comically obscure way: What is the mean intravaginal ejaculation latency time? I know there’s a lot more to sex than putting the penis into the vagina and ejaculating, but the rest is not always easy to define (kissing? Rubbing? Grinding?). To keep things simple and specific, we’ll just focus on the time to ejaculation. Measuring an average time to ejaculation is not a straightforward matter. What about just asking people how long they take, you say? Well, there are two main problems with this. One is that people are likely to be biased upwards in their time estimates, because it’s socially desirable to say you go long into the night. The other problem is that people don’t necessarily know how long they go for. Sex isn’t something people normally do while monitoring the bedside clock, and unassisted time estimation may be difficult during a transportative session of love-making. What does the research say? The best study we have estimating the average time to ejaculation in the general population involved 500 couples from around the world timing themselves having sex over a four-week period – using a stopwatch. That is as practically awkward as it sounds: participants pressed \"start\" at penile penetration and \"stop\" at ejaculation. You may note this could affect the mood somewhat, and might perhaps not exactly reflect the natural flow of things. But – science is rarely perfect, and this is the best we’ve got. So what did the researchers find? The most striking result is that there was a huge amount of variation. The average time for each couple (that is, averaged across all the times they had sex) ranged from 33 seconds to 44 minutes. That’s an 80-fold difference. \\ue607 Where tech meets sex \\ue612 \\ue611 \\ue607 6 show all \\ue603 \\ue607 Where tech meets sex \\ue612 \\ue611 1/6 Lovely - the smart sex toy that has been dubbed \\'the Fitbit for your penis\\' Tired of not being able to track the average speed of your thrusts during sex?

The gadget \"enables the user to enjoy the full Fleshlight experience while enjoying content or communicating live with a friend via applications like Facetime or Skype,\" makers Interactive Life Forms claim, with its trailer showing a man making use of one while video-chatting with his girlfriend So it’s clear there’s no one \"normal\" amount of time to have sex. The average (median, technically) across all couples, though, was 5.4 minutes. This means that if you line up the 500 couples from shortest sex to longest sex, the middle couple goes for an average of 5.4 minutes each time they do it. There were some interesting secondary results, too. For example, condom use didn’t seem to affect the time, and neither did men’s being circumcised or not, which challenges some conventional wisdom regarding penile sensitivity and its relationship to staying power in the sack. It didn’t much matter which country the couples came from either – unless they came from Turkey, in which case their sex tended to be significantly shorter (3.7 minutes) than couples from other countries (Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States). Another surprising finding was that the older the couple, the shorter the sex, contrary to the prevailing wisdom (probably peddled by older men). Why do we have sex for so long? As an evolutionary researcher, all this talk of how long sex lasts make me wonder: Why does it last any time at all? All sex really needs to achieve, it seems, is to put sperm into the vagina. Why all the thrusting and bumping? Instead of sliding the penis in and out many hundreds of times per sexual session, why not just put it in once, ejaculate, and then go have a lemonade and get on with the rest of the day? Before you say, Because it’s fun to go in and out!, remember evolution doesn’t care about fun per se – it generally only \"designs\" things to be enjoyable if they helped our ancestors pass on their genes to future generations. For example, even though we like eating food, we don’t chew each mouthful of it for five minutes just to make the enjoyment last longer. That would be inefficient, and so we’ve evolved to find it gross. \\ue001 \\ue001 Play Current Time 0:00 / Duration Time 0:00 Remaining Time -0:00 Stream Type LIVE Loaded : 0% Progress : 0% 00:00 \\ue000 Fullscreen Playback Rate 1 \\ue00c Subtitles subtitles off \\ue008 Captions captions settings captions settings captions off \\ue00c Chapters Chapters \\ue006 Mute 00:00 \\ue805 Share Foreground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque Background --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent Window --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent Font Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400% Text Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow Font Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps Defaults Done \\ue800 Close Share Video: Share via: \\ue801 Facebook \\ue802 Google+ \\ue803 Twitter \\ue804 tumblr \\ue806 Pinterest \\ue807 LinkedIn Start From: Direct Link: Embed Code: \\ue808 Restart The UK\\'s favourite sex positions Why we last so long is a pretty complicated question with no clear answer, but a clue may be in the way the penis is shaped. In 2003, researchers showed – using artificial vaginas, artificial penises, and artificial sperm (corn syrup) – that the ridge around the head of the penis actually scoops out pre-existing syrup from the vagina. What this suggests is that men’s repeated thrusting might function to displace other men’s semen before ejaculating, ensuring their own swimmers have a better chance of reaching the egg first. Incidentally, this could explain why it becomes painful for a man to continue thrusting after ejaculating, since that would risk scooping out his own semen as well. So what to do with this information? My advice would be to try not to think about it during the throes of passion.

              "  {'guid': 646, 'text_a': 'The antibodies that were invented to help immunologists find GOD - The antibodies that were invented to help immunologists find GODIn the classic 1966 science fiction film, Fantastic Voyage , a submarine is shrunk to microscopic size and injected into the blood stream of a scientist to remove a blood clot in his brain. The film illustrates many aspects of biology, perhaps most memorably when Raquel Welch ventures out of the submarine and is attacked by antibody molecules, which recognise her as a foreign invader and try to destroy her. The antibodies of the film look like wriggly bits of string that rush at her and then adapt themselves to the shape of her body. For an immunologist Fantastic Voyage is interesting as it was made when there were competing theories of how antibodies worked One, the instructional theory, suggested that all antibody molecules were the same, but they folded themselves around their target and learned its shape – to forestall future invasions – before destroying it. The alternative – clonal selection theory – says that there were billions of different antibodies, each with a different shape. Each B cell (a type of immune cell) specialises in making just one type of antibody. When a foreign invader, such as bacteria, enters the body, only one B cell will recognise it. That B cell would begin to rapidly divide, making large numbers of clones. These newly cloned B cells secrete large amounts of antibody which stick to the invader and mark it for destruction. The instructional theory was championed by no less a person than two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling , while Macfarlane Burnet (also a Nobel Prize winner) was the key proponent of clonal selection . The makers of the film followed Pauling, though, whether this was for scientific reasons or because the interaction between stringy antibodies and Welch made for better cinema isn’t clear. However, they were wrong, clonal selection theory won the argument. Nowadays clonal selection seems so obviously right that it is difficult to remember that it initially appeared to have a fatal flaw. Scientists knew that the immune system of an animal could make antibodies to any foreign antigen. In the 1930s Karl Landsteiner showed that antibodies could be made to chemicals that never even existed naturally. This led to a problem: for the clonal theory to be correct, there had to be pre-existing antibodies in animals or humans capable of recognising any antigen that might ever exist. This would require billions of different antibodies. And as every antibody is encoded by a separate gene, for there to be billions of antibody molecules there would also have to be billions of different genes. But there are no more than 25,000 genes to encode for everything in the human body, considerably fewer than needed to make the clonal selection theory possible. The GOD problem in several In the 1960s and 70s immunologists were increasingly convinced by the clonal selection theory. This led to a race to discover the solution to the problem of how so many different antibodies could be encoded. It was termed the \"generation of diversity\", or GOD problem. The GOD problem was such an important and intriguing question that it attracted many of the best scientists of the decade, and resulted Nobel Prizes . Scientists showed that GOD was due to several biological mechanisms that people had not realised could happen, including rearrangement of chunks of DNA in chromosomes, and deliberate mutation of DNA sequences The difficulty and novelty of the science meant that immunologists had to develop new technologies. And some of these techniques, which were used to answer fundamental questions, ended up having practical applications. Perhaps most notably César Milstein was interested in understanding how, during an immune response, antibodies improve and become better at binding to their antigens. He wanted to immunise an animal and then, at various times, isolate B cells to make antibodies. He could then use these to study how well they bound to their antigen, and also sequence the gene encoding the antibody to see how it changed over time. In doing so he developed, together with Georges Köhler in 1975, a method that made B cells live forever, making limitless amounts of what they called a monoclonal antibody Milstein realised that their technique, called hybridoma technology, had much wider applications in science and medicine. The impact of monoclonal antibodies as scientific tools and for the treatment of diseases has been immense. Because they can be made in large amounts, and are specific, they are used in many experiments and clinical tests. They have now also become an important type of drug , having an important role to play in treating many cancers as well as other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis . In economic terms, monoclonal antibody therapies are estimated to have had sales of US$75 billion in 2013. In an age that demands that science is useful and should be applied, it is perhaps worth remembering that one of the most important technologies in medicine and biology was developed to answer a very basic scientific question. Scientists are motivated to develop new techniques to answer important questions. They often later find that these techniques have important practical applications beyond their original purpose.

              "  {'guid': 650, 'text_a': 'One Guy Decided To Explore This Abandoned Building... And Instantly Regretted It. - Guy Decides To Explore An Abandoned Building That Turned Out To Be Crack HouseHave you ever come across an abandoned building and just get the feeling that something amazing could be inside? I do all the time. Taking risks and going places you aren’t supposed to is a great adrenaline rush. Now, I’m not trying to promote trespassing of any kind. I’m a responsible adult....sometimes. The excitement of the unknown is what drives many people’s curiosity when they decide to finally give urban exploring a try. Maybe you’ll see a ghost, or find an abandoned safe. It’s never the same thing twice though. You really don’t have any idea what you’re going to find or discover. Well that was the driving force behind a man named Dan Bell and his recent decision to explore an abandoned apartment complex. It started out as a simple urban exploration video, but turned into something much more life-threatening in mere moments. Check out the pictures and video he captured, and how this attempt at urban exploration was almost his last. He starts out his journey in a small alleyway formed by the abandoned building. This place looks like something out of a horror movie. Dan had passed by this scary abandoned apartment for a few weeks, and just couldn’t seem to get it off his mind. Dan had found blood and animals parts around different part of the property in a previous shorter visit. He had also found summoning markings around certain parts of the property. As with all great urban explorers however, this only made his curiosity grow with every step. He climbed a ladder to reach an upper level of the apartment complex. Inside he found what you would expect to find in an old abandoned building. Trash was littered through the maze of rooms and hallways. The paint was peeling off of every single wall, while some walls weren’t even standing anymore. Every step he took was a gamble that the floor would support his weight. The remnant of what used to be tenants mail boxes for their apartments. This place definitely fell into serious decay after it was not longer being used. Falling debris was a definite worry while walking through this place. It’s so old the wood is rotting and won’t support the weight it used too. It became clearer and clearer that people had been in here after the place was abandoned. Apparently \"Tony\" wanted everyone to know he was there at one point. Finding a spot to step onto without the threat of a nail in your foot was quite the exercise. A tense moment came when Dan took a step, and the ground beneath him literally started to crumble and disintegrate. It’s a tense moment in an already tense video. He was extremely lucky that the floor never caved in on him during his visit. After walking through the upper levels for a bit, Dan decides to climb back down the ladder and tackle the ground level floors. This would be a turning point in the video. What happens next is something that I would never want to experience. Dan decided to check out an area up a flight of stairs. When he reached the top, he caught sight of something that just didn’t seem to fit with the rest of his surroundings. Just an ordinary reusable grocery bag right. The Snapple sticking out of the bag makes it seem like it was definitely put here recently. Of course, someone who has already come this far is going to investigate even further! Well damn! That’s a bunch of crack cocain ready to be sold! As soon as I saw this, my mood about this situation would have changed. This isn’t just a poke around an abandoned building anymore. After examining the contents of the container, Dan understandably got seriously freaked out. This was clearly a crack house, and he was standing there with a dealers stash. People have gotten killed for less. Well guess what? The dealer comes back! Pretty damn intense right?! This guy is seriously super lucky. I don’t have a doubt in my mind if these guys would have found him he would be dead. This building is definitely in the slums. If you watch the whole video, at around the 5:07 mark, you can clearly hear multiple gun shots ringing through the air in the general area. That right there would have probably be enough for me to say it’s time to go. Luckily Dan was able to wait out the crack dealer and his client and make a hasty getaway. You can clearly tell he is shaken up by the experience though as he is almost crying by the time he gets outside. He really was lucky to escape with his life.', 'text_b': None, 'label': False},\n",
              "  {'guid': 651, 'text_a': 'Here\\'s a controversial idea about China\\'s economy that no one wants to hear - China is too quick to rebalance its services sectorReuters For years, economists have been saying that China needs to \"rebalance\" its economy, and the government is on board with this daunting project. That means the country is attempting to move from an economy based on investment in industrial manufacturing to one based on domestic consumption driven by regular Chinese people working in the services sector. That is, China has been moving toward fewer coal miners and construction workers in favor of more bankers and shopkeepers. But what if we\\'ve got this all wrong? What if China is transitioning too early? That\\'s what HSBC economists Qu Hongbin and Jing Li have posited in a recent note, \"China\\'s new challenge: Faster services expansion, slower productivity growth.\" From the note (emphasis added): \"Both economic theory and empirical evidence suggest that premature deindustrialisation in developing countries can be damaging. It blocks the main channel of productivity growth, and therefore reduces the economy\\'s potential growth rate and its prospects of catching up with more advanced economies. \"Based on the experience of some Latin American countries, a lack of adequate investment and a tendency of specialising according to short-term, rather than long-term, comparative advantage are common mistakes made by developing countries. \"This kind of development strategy can result in an underdeveloped industrial sector and slow productivity growth. Given that China\\'s GDP per capita is only 14% that of the US, we believe it is way too early to shift towards services-led growth.\" Work, work, work, work, work What really worries HSBC is that the service sector\\'s jobs, while in general more labor intensive, are less productive for the economy than jobs in the industrial and manufacturing sectors. The bank\\'s analysts point out that workers in the former are just 80% as productive as those in the latter. HSBC Arguing against a shift to service-led growth is a super controversial thing because the Chinese government has already made rebalancing a top project — if not in deed, then certainly in word. The reason for that is simple: debt. China has a debt-to-GDP ratio of over 280%. Most of that is concentrated in the industrial and manufacturing sectors. In 2009, when the world was falling apart, the Chinese government decided to just open the money spigots to keep its economy running at full steam. That, coupled with a general lack of global demand for materials like steel and coal produced in Chinese factories, has led to overcapacity in those sectors. So, to combat that overcapacity, China would like to have fewer people working the jobs where they\\'re making the things that it seems the world has entirely too much of. The rest of the world would love that, too. Last week, the US House of Representatives held a hearing on the Chinese economy , \"Evaluating the Financial Risks of China,\" and much of it focused on what that country\\'s economic slowdown has done to the American steel industry. During the hearing, Thomas Gibson, president of the American Iron and Steel Institute, pointed out that 33 steel manufacturers have gone bankrupt since the 1990s. He also said that, between 2011 and 2015, the Chinese government claimed that 90 million tons of overcapacity in its steel market had been taken care of. In reality, 300 million tons had been added to China\\'s steel output. So what Gibson would like is for China to slow its production and wind the steel industry down. The problem with this solution, says HSBC, is that moving away from industry and manufacturing means that China won\\'t grow as fast — not just in the short term, but also in the long term. From the note (emphasis added): \"The efficiency loss during such a \\'rebalancing\\' can be huge. Between 2012 and 2015, the total number of migrant workers in the manufacturing sector declined by nearly 7m, compared with an increase of 5m in the three biggest services sectors (ie wholesale and retail, residential services, transportation and logistics). Based on 2015 statistics, each worker in the manufacturing sector generated RMB45,000 more output than their counterpart in the three biggest services sectors. Therefore, if all 5m workers had been employed in the manufacturing sector rather than services, China\\'s total output in 2015 could have been RMB225bn higher, which is around 0.3% of annual GDP.\" HSBC suggests that the country makes more targeted and productive investments in the manufacturing and industrial sectors. But, to be honest, the Chinese government hasn\\'t shown that kind of subtlety. Even now, banks continue to lend to unproductive corporations in order to keep workers employed and avoid a hard landing in the short term. Meanwhile, the transition to the service sector continues.
